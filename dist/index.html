But in every other language I have learned, it is treated as extra or advanced. Since learning Go, I have become very happy with the idea of writing a function and writing a test.</p> <p>In other langues and various frameworks, I find myself having to FIND testing training for testing in other languages and frameworks. I know the concepts transfer, but the tools are always unique.</p> <p>I am not looking to insult any other languages. I know each language has it&#39;s advantages, disadvantages, use cases, and reasons for doing what it does. There must be a good reason.</p> <p>Does anyone who uses multiple languages, understand why there is this different mindset?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After transitioning my numerical simulations for orbital mechanics to Rust to leverage its performance and development efficiency, I identified a need for more comprehensive differential equation solvers. Existing Rust alternatives to tools like Scipy&#39;s <code>solve_ivp</code> lacked features such as event handling, solution output control, and greater flexibility in design.</p> <p>To address this, I developed <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations">differential-equations</a>, a library in Rust for numerically solving Ordinary (ODE), Delay (DDE), and Stochastic (SDE) differential equations. The library utilizes a trait-driven architecture, resulting in an idiomatic and adaptable API that allows for easy interchange of different numerical integration methods and customization of the solution process.</p> <p>The implemented features include:</p> <ul> <li>User defines their differential system via Traits</li> <li>Event Handling: Capabilities for defining and accurately detecting specific events during the integration.</li> <li>Solution Output Control: Fine-grained management over the output between steps.</li> <li>Polars Integration: Convert solutions into Polars dataframes</li> <li>Many more in the docs!</li> </ul> <p>Inspired by projects such as Scipy&#39;s <code>solve_ivp</code> and DifferentialEquations.jl, this library offers a robust set of functionalities that may be beneficial for those interested in using Rust for scientific computing.</p> <p>In a benchmark comparison between Rust and Fortran, this library has demonstrated performance improvements of approximately 10% compared to equivalent Fortran implementations for the DOP853 solver, which is exceptional given Fortran is considered the gold standard for numerical simulations. I also made a simplified test with <code>hyperfine</code> which showed a 40% improvement, but I am not certain of the accuracy of that result. If you&#39;re interested, you can find more details here:<a href="https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations-comparison">https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations-comparison</a></p> <p>The library is available at: </p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations">https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations</a><br/> Crates.io:<a href="https://crates.io/crates/differential-equations">https://crates.io/crates/differential-equations</a></p> <p>I am curious what y&#39;all think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sc2Ryan"> /u/Sc2Ryan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/Ryan-D-Gast/differential-equations">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kl8b0i/differentialequations_highperformance_odeddesde/">[comments]</a></span></div>

All of my life I believed that no matter how impossible what you&#39;re aiming for is, all you have to do is tighten your shoe laces and smash your head against the wall until you eventually get through. And I had the results as proof.</p> <p>I&#39;ve NEVER failed in doing anything I&#39;ve set my mind to. Even when I suffered setbacks, i could see that I was taking two steps back and three steps forward. I could see how my failures were getting me closer to my goals.</p> <p>Until I installed Unity... My ego was crushed. Never before in my life have I felt so utterly helpless in the face of a challenge. I think I&#39;ve solved a problem or that I&#39;ve figured something out, but then I get punched by another wall that sets me back ten steps and reminds me that I don&#39;t even know enough to know that I don&#39;t know enough. Every time I come up with an idea, I can&#39;t even start to THINK about how to implement it. It&#39;s brutal. </p> <p>Game development did to me what the hyper competitive Iranian college system and the notoriously Senior dominated job market couldn&#39;t do. It humbled me. </p> <p>My question is, does it get easier? Am I eventually going to develop an intuition on how to do certain tasks?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Introduction</h1> <p>We are building an online multiplayer zombie survival game (Sombie), it is a year into active development now. It‚Äôs top-down, PvPvE, procedurally generated. No Unity, Unreal, or Godot. Just code, lots and lots of code... JS/TS/WebGPU (PixiJS), Vite, electron, Node.js, Native C++ modules on the backend, and a whole lot of trial and error, and a little helping hand from copilot here and there...</p> <p>I said we, and while it&#39;s true I am not alone on this and my partner on this project is kick-ass, I am the only one who writes any code. Everything else I get a ton of help with. Game design, art, music, play testing, you name it. This article will be about my part in this ...</p> <h1>Why?</h1> <p>A bit of undiagnosed ADHD might be behind this madness. I have tried again and again with different game engines, lost interest and quit. I don&#39;t think I enjoy making games... Not the &quot;normal&quot; way. I despise tutorials, nested menus, and everything else that comes with common game engines. I also get tempted to use assets that I don&#39;t fully understand and end up with a boring cookie cutter game. I fully recognize this is a me issue and not an issue with game engines. I need help, you are clearly superior to me...</p> <h1>Started with Unity</h1> <p>We have had this project to build an online zombie game since 2022 (3 years ago). Started with Unity, used a networking library to build out a working prototype. This game was in 3D at that time, but it never fully clicked and got to be something worth showing off... I did write an article about it though at the time, <a href="https://markus.wyrin.se/csharp-unity-online-multiplayer-game/">https://markus.wyrin.se/csharp-unity-online-multiplayer-game/</a> this was scrapped before it ever really got anywhere notable.</p> <h1>What have I learned?</h1> <p>Now for the reason you clicked... What have I actually learned? a metric <strong>F#(!&amp;-ton</strong>, but I will try to skip the boring stuff and mention the more eye-opening parts.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Most games net-code sucks</strong> I am being a bit tongue in cheek saying this. I am not delusional, I see the flaws in what I am building too, I am sure I have made a ton of mistakes I do not see as well. Building this project has made me a lot more aware of design decisions that were made in my favourite games and their shortcomings. I noticed game objects moving very choppy in Gray Zone Warfare... I see cheaters in Phasmophobia completely manipulating lobbies. I think back to when I used to play Arma 2 and all players were teleported into the sky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOOL2hle9WI&amp;ab_channel=SethMcFarland">forced to do the Gangnam style dance</a> before offing themselves... I now know why these things happen, and I know how to prevent them, and I know how to do it better myself. I don&#39;t know for sure that I always am though, I am sure I let issues slip through that will show themselves in due time...</li> <li><strong>Security</strong> Trust no one! I have a background as a professional software engineer. I am very used to thinking about vulnerabilities, this part sort of comes natural to me. Sort of... But it&#39;s much more apparent in this MMO than in web projects I have built in the past. I am used to trusting no one, but the issue with that in games is that any delay is very noticeable, you can&#39;t just put up a loader whenever the server is verifying something. Things need to happen instantly, and that makes things a lot harder, which brings us into the next topic...</li> <li><strong>Lag</strong> I might have spent half of my development time combatting lag in one way or another. There are so many variables in making an MMO work well that you just do not run into with singleplayer or P2P or smaller Multiplayer lobbies... Sombie uses pretty complex rollback netcode for the player characters, because that&#39;s the most latency critical. Some things are much more simple however, but everything is server authoritative. We do not trust the clients. The clients are assumed to be the devil by default, as it should be...</li> <li><strong>Scalability</strong> I am still terrified of this. I don&#39;t have a reliable way to test this. I do this part to the best of my ability, but I have never done this before. Many many big game studios fail at this, and I am trying to make a scalable always online MMO as a solo developer. I have run tests with ~10 clients connected at the same time, and trying to run artificial loads by upping the number of enemies to more than we will ever have in the released game, and so far -knock on wood- it seems fine? we have a playtest coming up on June 1st, we are letting people sign up on Steam. So far a little over 100 people have signed up over the past few days. Hoping a few hundred sign up before the playtest starts.</li> <li><strong>Shaders</strong> This started with me saying I hate <strong>F#(!&amp;</strong> shaders, and has ended up in a love-hate relationship. I started with trying to rely on what is already included in the <a href="https://pixijs.com/">pixi.js rendering library</a> that we are using. I quickly gave up on that, and I wanted something more custom. I learned the basics of WebGL and followed some very helpful articles on how to render light/shadows with WebGL. Shoutout to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuWefkOwuRY&amp;ab_channel=JordanWest">this YouTube video</a> and all the resources in the description. I was sad about using WebGL since the rendering lib we are using supports the much more modern and performant WebGPU API. So I spent a lot of time learning that to convert (and by now upgrade) what we had in WebGL. I could make a whole separate article just about my journey with shaders. There are so many things that are not really well known / documented, and I had to dig deep. Thanks to the very nice community at the discord group &quot;Graphics Programming&quot; I learned about PCSS, a rendering technique for soft shadows. That led me into a new rabbit hole of researching. I think the deepest I ever got was reading this <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf">https://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf</a> an old old pdf I found through google. It&#39;s old nvidia shader documentation :D It actually helped me understand it somewhat...</li> </ul> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>There are so many more things that I could write about, but I feel like this will become too much of a catch-all blog rather than an interesting post if I do. Topics that come to mind are why I went with web tech, and why the server uses some C++ instead of being entierly TS/JS, could also say a lot more about working with shaders. I also have a lot of learnings from what we did wrong... How terrible movement felt before adding rollback net-code. How we manage high framerate on low end hardware etc. Please let me know if you found any of this interesting, and also let me know if there is any other part I should go more in depth on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sugartitty"> /u/Sugartitty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kkvwpr/what_i_learned_making_an_mmo_without_a_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kkvwpr/what_i_learned_making_an_mmo_without_a_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

If one day I have 13 sales from China, 13 are refunded, If other day I have 9 sales, all refunded.</p> <p>Honestly I don&#39;t have idea why is this happening, I don&#39;t understand how Chinese market works.</p> <p>Some points that could be the reason of the 100% refunds:</p> <p>- Game extremely gory and bloody. I understand that this type of games are often censured in countries like Japan or China, and it seemed the most logical reason for me. But why would they buy the game in the first place if it is clearly shown on the page to be very gory and gore?</p> <p>- Poor chinese translation. As my game is a party game and doesn&#39;t needs to much text to play it I decided to translate it by myself using online tools. Perhaps it is not well seen by the chinese users?</p> <p>- Asian servers. My game has dedicated servers in Asia. At first I thought they weren&#39;t working well, but I tried playing matches in Asia region by myself and everything seems working fine.</p> <p>I can&#39;t get any feedback from any chinese players. Usually when something is not working properly, the users join my discord server to report my any problem or they leave a negative review, but no info at all about this matter.</p> <p>P.D: My game has an option, to customize blood color or even disable it. But dismemberments are part of the core mechanics so it can&#39;t be disabled.</p> <p>P.P.D: So it seems that when I switched from peer to peer connections, to dedicated servers with Multiplay Hosting, I didn&#39;t see that Multiplay is offering his services in all Asia except China. For some reason I thought that China was supported by Multiplay because I saw some chinese users playing on my servers several times. Maybe were they using VPN? I&#39;m not sure, but I assume this is the problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdriBeh"> /u/AdriBeh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kkvke2/all_my_game_sales_on_china_are_refunded_any_idea/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kkvke2/all_my_game_sales_on_china_are_refunded_any_idea/">[comments]</a></span></div>

At the heart of this story is Leo, a former soldier returning to his recently liberated hometown to uncover the fate of his family.</p> <p>As a solo indie developer from Ukraine, I‚Äôve drawn from my own experiences of living through war to create this game.</p> <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551300/BROKEN_LIFE/?utm_source=reddit">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551300/BROKEN_LIFE</a></p> <p><strong>Released on Early Access on April 30, 2025. What to say?</strong></p> <p><strong>Short:</strong> I&#39;m very happy of reaching milestone after two years of development.</p> <p><strong>Long:</strong> BROKEN LIFE is a very tough game to sell. It is a point-and-click adventure, war themed, depressive. But I had to make this game to make this game for three reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Game creation is a part of my therapy. There is a war in my country. Almost everyday we are under air attacks (drones, missiles etc.). A lot of good people died, including those who I know by myself. There is a lot of pain, grief and anger sitting in me. So I found a way to express those feelings in my game.</li> <li>Share pain. A lot of people in Ukraine struggle of war. This game brings hope to them as the main theme is &quot;end of war and de-occupation of our land&quot;.</li> <li>Spread a word over the world. This game is my manifest and I want people all over the world to play it to understand our feelings.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Development:</strong> it took two years for me to make first chapter of three planned. One hour gameplay, tons of puzzles, deep plot. It&#39;s kinda suicide as I did know that game won&#39;t sell good on start. But I still wanted to make it.</p> <p><strong>Engine:</strong> Clickteam Fusion 2.5+. Perfect engine for me wih their visual coding system. I am a creator, not a programmer. So well, it actually kinda good for 2d projects. And the most nice thing is - pay once and forget. Pretty expensive, but it worth it.</p> <p><strong>Marketing:</strong> I didn&#39;t make a lot of marketing because I hate it. But I did some of it. <strong>What works nice:</strong></p> <p>- articles in media. I have sent press releases to game media and news media mostly in Ukraine</p> <p>- posts on Telegram in game channels</p> <p>- posts on reddit subs</p> <p><strong>What doesn&#39;t work:</strong></p> <p>- Twitter. It shadowbans me because I use my account to provide my position on russian-Ukranian war and you know... So i deleted it.</p> <p><strong>What I din&#39;t do but it should work if I had desire to do this:</strong></p> <p>- regular posting, devlog</p> <p>- reels</p> <p><strong>Wishlists:</strong> before release it was 2400+ wishlist which I have gathered mostly because of reddit, steam next fest, steam Ukranian fest and articles on media when demo was released. For 11 days after release I have gathered additional 699 wishlists (-86 deletions) mostyl by reaching same media and reddit.</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong> 308 copies for 12 days. Half of them - from Ukraine. Local marketing works.</p> <p><strong>WHAT I DID WHAT ALMOST NOONE DOES:</strong> I have localized my game on 17 languages using DeepL. As a non-English developer and a gamer I understand how much it means when you can play game on your own language. As a result - I have sales (and reviews) from Germany (3rd place) China (4th place), Japan (6th place), Taiwan (7th place) etc. In future plans all 17 languages will also attempt ElevenLabs AI dubbing.</p> <p><strong>Position:</strong> game doesn&#39;t support russian languagge and is banned to sell in russia (as steam pays taxes in ruissa when someone buy the game). No money offers will change my mind. NEVER.</p> <p><strong>Plans:</strong> gather feedback, wishlists, finish second and third chapter by the end of the year.</p> <p>I will be glad to receive a feedback <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551300/BROKEN_LIFE/?utm_source=reddit"><strong>on the game</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ikkosama_UA"> /u/Ikkosama_UA </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kktkwf/my_first_game_broken_life_released_on_early/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kktkwf/my_first_game_broken_life_released_on_early/">[comments]</a></span></div>
