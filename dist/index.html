            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the best practice for managing the function coloring issue?</p> <p>I have a tiny library that has been using sync, that I figure I should switch over to async since that&#39;s the direction the ecosystem seems to be going for I/O. I&#39;ve done a manually split API presuming tokio, but it looks like maybe-async-cfg could be used to automate this.</p> <p>It&#39;d also be nice to make the code executor-agnostic, but it requires UnixDatagram, which has to be provided by tokio, async-io, etc.</p> <p>Another issue is that I have to delete a file-like object when the connection is closed. I&#39;d put it into Drop and then warn if the fs::remove_file call fails. However this introduces I/O code into an async context. The code doesn&#39;t need to wait for the file to actually be removed, except to produce the warning. Firing up a thread for a single operation like this to avoid blocking an event loop seems excessive, but I also can&#39;t access the executor from the sync-only Drop trait (and again we have the issue of which runtime the user is using).</p> <p>Specific code:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/spease/wpa-ctrl-rs/tree/async-test-fixes">https://github.com/spease/wpa-ctrl-rs/tree/async-test-fixes</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sepease"> /u/sepease </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kjn30p/best_practice_for_asyncagnostic_code_these_days/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kjn30p/best_practice_for_asyncagnostic_code_these_days/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Rust users consider this to be a positive, because it makes them &quot;write good code&quot;, but the more time I spend with the language the more I doubt how much of this is true. Good code is written by iterating on an idea and trying things out, and while the borrow checker can force more iterations, that does not mean that this is a desirable way to write code. I&#39;ve often found that <strong>being unable to just</strong> <strong><em>move on for now</em></strong> <strong>and solve my problem and fix it later was what was truly hurting my ability to write good code</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>The usual response when someone says this is &quot;Just use Arc&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid to .clone()&quot;, and so on. I think that&#39;s good advice, because tools like <code>Arc</code>, <code>RwLock</code>/<code>Mutex</code>, and <code>.clone()</code> really can make all your problems go away.</p> <p>The main obstacle for me when it came to actually putting this advice into practice is... writing <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> everywhere is annoying and ugly.</p> <p>So I created <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cowboy">cowboy</a>. This is a simple wrapper for <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> that&#39;s designed to be as low boilerplate as possible.</p> <p>```rust use cowboy::*;</p> <p>// use <code>.cowboy()</code> on any value to get a Cowboy version of it. let counter = 0.cowboy();</p> <p>println!(&quot;Counter: {counter}&quot;);</p> <p>// Cloning a cowboy gives you a pointer to the same underlying data let counter_2 = counter.clone();</p> <p>// Modify the value *counter.w() += 1;</p> <p>// Both counter and counter_2 were modified assert_eq!(counter, counter_2); ```</p> <p>It also provides <code>SHERIFF</code> for safe global mutable storage.</p> <p>```rust use cowboy::*;</p> <p>let counter = 0.cowboy();</p> <p>// You can register cowboys with the SHERIFF using any key type SHERIFF.register(&quot;counter&quot;, counter.clone()); SHERIFF.register(42, counter.clone());</p> <p>// Access from anywhere let counter<em>1 = SHERIFF.get::&lt;</em>, i32&gt;(&quot;counter&quot;); let counter<em>2 = SHERIFF.get::&lt;</em>, i32&gt;(42); // Note: not &amp;42</p> <p>*counter.w() += 1; *counter_1.w() += 2; *counter_2.w() += 3;</p> <p>// All counters should have the same value since they&#39;re all clones of the same original counter assert_eq!(counter_1, counter_2); println!(&quot;Counter: {counter}&quot;); ```</p> <p>I think we can all agree that you shouldn&#39;t use <code>Cowboy</code> or <code>SHERIFF</code> in production code, but I&#39;m hopeful it can be useful for when you&#39;re prototyping and want the borrow checker to get out of your way. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chad_Nauseam"> /u/Chad_Nauseam </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kjhmqd/cowboy_a_lowboilerplate_wrapper_for_arcrwlockt/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kjhmqd/cowboy_a_lowboilerplate_wrapper_for_arcrwlockt/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I&#39;m OWL - I recently ran a Reddit ad campaign to drive wishlists &amp; demo plays for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2936750/Lokis_Revenge/">my game, Loki&#39;s Revenge. </a>This was my first time running any sort of paid ad campaign. I decided to experiment with a very low-stakes amount of money ($5 per day/$35ish total) just to see what would happen. My thesis was that, even on this small of a spend scale, I&#39;d be able to validate whether there was any genuine interest in my game with some visibility. If the ad performed better than the average numbers I was seeing, chances are I have something. If not, then I&#39;ve got a dud.</p> <h1>The numbers:</h1> <ul> <li>Total spend: $41.07 (higher than the $35 budget, Reddit notes this can happen)</li> <li>Total Impressions: 49,382</li> <li>Total Clicks: 484</li> <li>Avg eCPM: $0.83</li> <li>Avg CPC: $0.08</li> <li>Avg CTR: 0.980% (was over 1% for most days, apparently 0.2% is typical average)</li> <li>Wishlists: 56 gained, 3 deleted, 53 net</li> <li>CPW (Cost Per Wishlist): $0.73 (includes 3 deletions, which could&#39;ve been accidental WL, immediate un-WL, but idk if that counts that way or not)</li> <li>Starting WL count: 417, end: 470</li> </ul> <h1>The goal &amp; reasoning</h1> <p>I shipped a major update to the demo of my game and wasn&#39;t getting really any reaction. I was wondering if my game was a dud and decided an ad campaign might be a good way to validate it (read: make myself feel better in the moment) - no relying on someone with a following to pick the game up or rely on organic social media posting. I figured I could judge the ad performance based on other benchmarks people had posted and on my usual wishlist numbers (1 per day avg). If it outperformed, then I could assume my game <em>does</em> have some potential. If it was below average and/or no notable change from my normal wishlist velocity, then I&#39;ve got nothing.</p> <p>So my goals were:</p> <ol> <li>Validate that my game has legs</li> <li>Collect wishlists (ideally at a CPW lower than my planned cost)</li> <li>Get Demo downloads &amp; plays</li> </ol> <h1>What I did:</h1> <ul> <li>I setup the campaign to run for 1 week, starting on May 01 2025 and ending on May 08 2025</li> <li>Set a budget of $5 per day</li> <li>Objective: Traffic (I think missed this in the initial setup, apparently Conversions is better according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ilr9w5/reddit_ads_postmortem_what_i_learned_after_2/">this post</a>, but seems like the ad performed well anyway)</li> <li>Audience: targeted specific survivors-like games that had subreddits, as well as some general ones that made sense like survivorslikes and roguelikes</li> <li>I also threw in a couple bigger ones, but avoided huge ones like gaming and steam that were maybe too broad</li> <li>I avoided any gamedev subreddits - not my target audience</li> <li>Left automated targeting on based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ilr9w5/reddit_ads_postmortem_what_i_learned_after_2/">previous post</a></li> <li>On May 5th I added non-US countries, since I didn&#39;t realize I had it set to US-only. I didn&#39;t localize the ad and figured the countries I targeted + Reddit&#39;s magic would get enough people that also spoke/read English</li> <li>I kept getting an error uploading the trailer, so just gave up and used the capsule art. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ilr9w5/reddit_ads_postmortem_what_i_learned_after_2/">Previous post </a>said video VS image didn&#39;t matter, it was the thumbnail that mattered, figured I&#39;d use the art I commissioned with the express purpose of getting people to click</li> <li>Linked to the game&#39;s page, not the demo&#39;s page, in order to firstly drive wishlists, demo plays second</li> <li>CTA used &quot;Play Now&quot; to imply the demo&#39;s existence</li> <li>Copy: &quot;Norse Mythology Survivors-like where you play as overpowered Norse gods fighting Loki&#39;s army&quot; - tried to pick something that sounded like a normal post, not an ad</li> <li>Left comments on but got 0 weirdly enough</li> <li>I setup UTM link for the campaign (if you&#39;ve never done it, literally just make one up based on the guidelines Steam gives on the UTM page and check it with the tool on that page and you&#39;re good, there&#39;s no specific setup for it)</li> <li>I did not do any organic posting of any kind about the game during this time period. There were posts from the day or two before, and it&#39;s possible there&#39;s some mixing of data here</li> </ul> <h1>Results by day &amp; analysis</h1> <p>I laid out the full campaign&#39;s numbers up top, but for posterity here&#39;s how it performed for each day:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Day</th> <th align="left">$ Spent</th> <th align="left">Impressions</th> <th align="left">Clicks</th> <th align="left">eCPM</th> <th align="left">CPC</th> <th align="left">CTR</th> <th align="left">Wishlists Gained</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">1</td> <td align="left">$4.33</td> <td align="left">1501</td> <td align="left">9</td> <td align="left">$2.88</td> <td align="left">$0.48</td> <td align="left">0.6%</td> <td align="left">6</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">2</td> <td align="left">$5.95</td> <td align="left">1755</td> <td align="left">25</td> <td align="left">$3.39</td> <td align="left">$0.24</td> <td align="left">1.425%</td> <td align="left">7</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">3</td> <td align="left">$5.40</td> <td align="left">1913</td> <td align="left">50</td> <td align="left">$2.82</td> <td align="left">$0.11</td> <td align="left">2.614%</td> <td align="left">7</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">4</td> <td align="left">$5.60</td> <td align="left">1733</td> <td align="left">56</td> <td align="left">$3.23</td> <td align="left">$0.10</td> <td align="left">3.231%</td> <td align="left">6</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">5</td> <td align="left">$5.21</td> <td align="left">8123</td> <td align="left">69</td> <td align="left">$0.64</td> <td align="left">$0.08</td> <td align="left">0.849%</td> <td align="left">11</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">6</td> <td align="left">$5.11</td> <td align="left">11198</td> <td align="left">100</td> <td align="left">$0.46</td> <td align="left">$0.05</td> <td align="left">0.893%</td> <td align="left">11</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">7</td> <td align="left">$5.30</td> <td align="left">14945</td> <td align="left">92</td> <td align="left">$0.35</td> <td align="left">$0.06</td> <td align="left">0.616%</td> <td align="left">4</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>You can see that there&#39;s truth to the idea that the Reddit algo needs to &quot;warm up&quot; in the first days of the campaign and whenever you make a change. The impressions and clicks were at their lowest Day 1 by far.</p> <p>Day 5 is when I added the non-US regions. You can see the massive spike in impressions, a boost in clicks, and the lowering of eCPM, CPC, and CTR respectively. Based on the Steam UTM data, it looks like the US remained the top country followed by Brazil and Germany. Unclear whether that&#39;s where people just happened to click more, where Reddit served more ads based on CPC and my bid, or some other factor I&#39;m not accounting for. My Steam page is translated, but the ad wasn&#39;t, so I would assume it accounted more for wishlists in those regions than clicks on the ad.</p> <p>Notably, the wishlist count doesn&#39;t really chance during these periods. The US-only days hovered pretty consistently at 6-7 wishlists. Once non-US territories were included, they jumped to 11 wishlists for 2 days, then tanked back down to 4 wishlists on the last day despite the highest number of impressions. I can only speculate why it shook out this way - maybe because I had a specific set of smaller communities, those people got fatigued by seeing the ad every day? Maybe the data set here is too small and it&#39;s just noise at this scale? Not really sure, curious to get thoughts from folks here who have more experience with paid campaigns.</p> <p>Steam claims that only 33 wishlist can be attributed to the ad - but, my hunch is that a chunk of people clicked on the ad on their phone, then instead looked up the game on their computer (maybe don&#39;t have the Steam app, aren&#39;t logged in on their phone, etc.) which maybe then didn&#39;t get tracked as a UTM-attributed wishlist.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Realistically, the campaign is probably too small to be considered anything more than noise. I <em>do</em> still feel better about my game after doing this, though - even though the wishlist boost was small relative to other games, it was a big boost for mine. The ads definitely did their job of driving wishlists (and demo plays, but that was an even smaller number). It&#39;s also possible that this momentum maintains in the coming days and keeps my game at a higher baseline wishlist velocity - remains to be seen.</p> <p>If nothing else, it&#39;s convinced me to run another ad campaign around release to help drive wishlists and sales during a big beat.</p> <p>Thanks for reading! Hopefully this information helps someone else.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/owlgamedev"> /u/owlgamedev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kjn7rn/postmortem_on_a_reddit_ad_campaign_i_ran_for_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kjn7rn/postmortem_on_a_reddit_ad_campaign_i_ran_for_my/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am posting this on behalf of my partner, who is questioning their college prospects and future.</p> <p>Hey everyone, I am currently 25 years old and will be 26 in September- I graduated with my Associates in Art a few years ago where I completed the majority of my Liberal Studies. I am currently attending my first quarter at DePaul University in Chicago, a private Christian college in Chicago Illinois. As I see it now I should be graduating by Winter 2028 and I will be 29. I&#39;m looking to go into Game Development for my full time career as of course I am an avid gamer, but I also love the trial and error process that goes into making a game and follow several smaller developers and their projects. Would you say it&#39;s worth it and be good for my future career to get a Bachelor&#39;s in Computer Science with a focus on Game Systems? Or is it better to learn on my own and publish smaller projects/gain a community without formal schooling? I&#39;m worried about being in thousands of dollars of debt and still unable to get a job after all that work- but I&#39;m also afraid if I freelance no one will accept me without an official degree on my resume.

I felt stuck.</p> <p>Then out of nowhere, a creator with decent following, <strong>Idle Cub</strong> covered the game. Boom: a huge spike in wishlists the next day. That gave me a second wind. A couple more creators followed, both mid-sized but super relevant creators: <strong>Aavak</strong>, <strong>Frazz,</strong> and momentum started building. I tried to disconnect with a quick van trip... but couldn‚Äôt resist sending one last email, this time to <strong>SplatterCat Gaming</strong>, not expecting much.</p> <p>Two days later: he drops a video. It does great. Wishlists skyrocket.
