Ive written a lot of python and this is easy with patching and mocks, so you don&#39;t need to change the structure of your code that much.</p> <p>Ive been writing a lot of Go too and it seems like the way to structure code is to have structs for everything and the structs all hold function pointers to basically anything a function might need, then in a <code>new</code> function set up the struct with normally needed functions, then in the test have functions that return the values you want to test against. Instead of maybe calling <code>SystemTime::now()</code> you would set up a struct that has a pointer to now and anytime you use it you call <code>self.now()</code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/commonsearchterm"> /u/commonsearchterm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kp9ozo/unit_testing_patterns/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kp9ozo/unit_testing_patterns/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, new to rust. I have been studying about generics and I am a bit confused about the placement of the generic type. I saw a similar question posted a few months ago (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/1fw9y45/what_is_different_in_the_positioning_of_generics/">link</a>) and what I understood is that generic parameters that are used across the implementation in various functions are placed next to impl and the generic types that are specific to the method are placed in the method definition. Something like this </p> <pre><code>struct Point&lt;X1, Y1&gt; { x: X1, y: Y1, } impl&lt;X1, Y1&gt; Point&lt;X1, Y1&gt; { fn mixup&lt;X2, Y2&gt;(self, other: Point&lt;X2, Y2&gt;) -&gt; Point&lt;X1, Y2&gt; { Point { x: self.x, y: other.y, } } } </code></pre> <p>I was wondering why can&#39;t we put X2 and Y2 inside the impl block.</p> <pre><code>struct Point&lt;X1, Y1&gt; { x: X1, y: Y1, } impl&lt;X1, Y1, X2, Y2&gt; Point&lt;X1, Y1&gt; { fn mixup(self, other: Point&lt;X2, Y2&gt;) -&gt; Point&lt;X1, Y2&gt; { Point { x: self.x, y: other.y, } } } </code></pre> <p>The above code seems like a more general version of the first scenario, but unfortunately it is giving a compile time error. Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Trick-Bench5593"> /u/Trick-Bench5593 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koziop/placement_of_generics_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koziop/placement_of_generics_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m encountering a frustrating issue while working on a Rust project on my macOS M3 machine. I&#39;m using the <code>thirtyfour</code> crate (version <code>0.35.0</code>) to automate tasks in Chrome. Launching the browser and performing actions works perfectly. However, I&#39;m struggling to reliably close all the associated <code>chromedriver</code> processes afterwards.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the code I use to launch the browser:</p> <pre><code>pub async fn launch_driver(port: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; { // Launch the browser let _ = Command::new(&quot;chromedriver&quot;) .arg(format!(&quot;--port={}&quot;, port)) .spawn() .map_err(|e| format!(&quot;Failed to launch browser: {}&quot;, e))?; // Wait for the browser to be ready let client = reqwest::Client::new(); loop { // Check if the browser is ready // by sending a request to the status endpoint match client.get(format!(&quot;http://localhost:{}/status&quot;, port)).send().await { Ok(resp) if resp.status().is_success() =&gt; { return Ok(()); } _ =&gt; { // If the request fails, wait for a bit and try again sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await; } } } } </code></pre> <p>My current approach to closing the browser involves the following steps:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Ensuring a clean port:</strong> I select a port that I verify is free before running any of my automation code.</li> <li><strong>Finding</strong> <code>chromedriver</code> <strong>PIDs:</strong> I use the <code>lsof</code> command to find the process IDs listening on this specific port.</li> <li><p><strong>Killing the processes:</strong> I iterate through the identified PIDs and attempt to terminate them using <code>kill -9</code>.</p> <p>pub async fn close_driver(port: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(), String&gt; { // Get the process ID of the browser let output = Command::new(&quot;lsof&quot;) .args(&amp;[&quot;-ti&quot;, &amp;format!(&quot;:{}&quot;, port)]) .output().unwrap();</p> <pre><code>// If we find any processes, kill them if output.status.success() { let stdout = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;output.stdout); for pid in stdout.lines().rev() { println!(&quot;Killing process: {}&quot;, pid); let _ = Command::new(&quot;kill&quot;) .arg(&quot;-9&quot;) .arg(pid); // Corrected: Using the pid variable } } Ok(()) </code></pre> <p>}</p></li> </ol> <p>When this code runs, I see output similar to this:</p> <pre><code>Killing process: 83838 Killing process: 83799 </code></pre> <p>However, after this runs, when I execute <code>lsof -i -n -P | grep chromedri</code> in my terminal, I often still find a <code>chromedriver</code> process running, for example:</p> <pre><code>chromedri 83838 enzoblain 5u IPv4 0xf2c6302b5fda8b46 0t0 TCP 127.0.0.1:9000 (LISTEN) chromedri 83838 enzoblain 6u IPv6 0x2b13d969a459f55a 0t0 TCP [::1]:9000 (LISTEN) chromedri 83838 enzoblain 9u IPv4 0xa823e9b8f2c600e3 0t0 TCP 127.0.0.1:60983-&gt;127.0.0.1:60981 (CLOSE_WAIT) </code></pre> <p>Interestingly, if I manually take the PIDs (like 83838) from the <code>lsof</code> output and run <code>kill -9 83838</code> in my terminal, it successfully terminates the process.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried various things, including adding delays after the <code>kill</code> command and even attempting to run the <code>lsof</code> and <code>kill</code> commands multiple times in a loop within my Rust code, but the issue persists. It seems like sometimes one process is killed, but not always all of them.</p> <p>Has anyone else on macOS (especially with Apple Silicon) experienced similar issues with process cleanup after using <code>thirtyfour</code> or other web automation tools? Are there any more robust or reliable ways to ensure all associated <code>chromedriver</code> processes are completely terminated programmatically in Rust?</p> <p>Any insights or alternative approaches would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blenzodu57"> /u/Blenzodu57 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koyzb0/trouble_reliably_killing_chromedriver_processes/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koyzb0/trouble_reliably_killing_chromedriver_processes/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In November 2023, Joshua MacDonald and I announced the completion of Phase 1 of the OTEL-Arrow (OTAP) project, aiming to optimize telemetry data transport (see this blog <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/otel-arrow/">post</a>). Initially implemented in Go as part of the Go OTEL Collector, the origins of this project date back 1.5 years earlier with a proof-of-concept built in Rust, leveraging Apache Arrow and DataFusion to represent and process OTEL streams.</p> <p>Today, we&#39;re thrilled to announce the next chapter: Phase 2 is officially underway, a return to the roots of this project, exploring an end-to-end OTAP pipeline fully implemented in Rust. We&#39;ve chosen Rust not only for its outstanding memory and thread safety, performance, and robustness but also for its strong Apache Arrow support and thriving ecosystem (e.g. DataFusion).</p> <p>This initiative is officially backed by the OTEL governance committee and is open for contributions. F5 and Microsoft are already actively contributing to the project (disclaimer: I&#39;m employed by F5). Our goals are clear: push the boundaries of performance, memory safety, and robustness through an optimized end-to-end OTAP pipeline.</p> <p>Currently, we&#39;re evaluating a thread-per-core, &quot;share-nothing&quot; architecture based on the single-threaded Tokio runtime (+ thread pinning, SO_REUSEPORT, ...). However, we also plan to explore other async runtimes such as Glommio and Monoio. Additionally, our pipeline supports both Send and !Send nodes and channels, depending on specific context and implementation constraints.</p> <p>We&#39;re still at a very early stage, with many open questions and exciting challenges ahead. If you&#39;re an expert in Rust and async programming and intrigued by such an ambitious project, please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lquerel/">contact me</a> directly (we are hiring), there are numerous exciting opportunities and discussions to be had!</p> <p>More details:</p> <ul> <li>Official announcement: <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/otel-arrow-phase-2/">https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2025/otel-arrow-phase-2/</a></li> <li>General Slack Channel: <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C07S4Q67LTF">https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C07S4Q67LTF</a></li> <li>Dev Slack Channel: <a href="https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08RRSJR7FD">https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08RRSJR7FD</a></li> <li>GitHub Repos: <ul> <li>Main (Go + Rust): <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow">https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow</a> (if you like this initiative, please support us by starring this repo)</li> <li>Rust Pipeline: <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/tree/main/rust/otap-dataflow">https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/tree/main/rust/otap-dataflow</a></li> <li>OTAP Encoder/Decoder (Rust): <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/tree/main/rust/otel-arrow-rust">https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/tree/main/rust/otel-arrow-rust</a></li> <li>Roadmap: <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/main/rust/otap-dataflow/ROADMAP.md">https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/main/rust/otap-dataflow/ROADMAP.md</a></li> </ul></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lquerel"> /u/lquerel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koywpk/opentelemetry_explores_a_new_highperformance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koywpk/opentelemetry_explores_a_new_highperformance/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks I&#39;m new to Rust, absolutely loving it but it is kind of off-putting how the lints are not instantaneous. The bulk of my experience is with C# and Java (and other JVM languages) and in those lands we are used to all IDE operations being instantaneous. You never have to wait for auto-complete or squiggly lines. In Rust this is particularly treacherous because the lints are absolutely non-trivial and necessary, due to the complexity of borrows and whatnot. But sometime I am waiting a couple seconds, and being new to the language this can add up RAPIDLY as I am experimenting with different constructs and operations to make everything work. It makes coding in Rust have this floaty feeling and is a huge obstacle to flow states in my opinion, it&#39;s not as electrical as it could in the brain if that makes sense, less of an extension of the brain. I know this is huge 21st century luxury coding stuff, ppl back in the days wrote massive software without even syntax highlighting, but tis the age of distraction and productivity maxxing and I need that shit injected into my brain in sub millisecond so my body can react before my brain even can process it. (for context I turn off v-sync across the entire system on linux to remove 1 frame of input lag since it&#39;s distracting, I don&#39;t feel as connected to the computer)</p> <p>So basically I&#39;m wondering if there is a fundamental limitation and stuff is already as optimized as it can be? Already it feels to me like the linters are not incremental and do a lot of redundant re-processing, i.e. way more than just the code that was edited since the last cargo check. At least there should be a way that lints can be streamed to the IDE in real-time, and the IDE could indicate the origin to induce a priority gradient across the codebase which is immediate for the current file, function, etc. Just spitballing here. What devious tricks can we use to achieve sub millisecond perfection? I bet it would facilitate language adoption a lot! subtle things like that add up and allow people to grok things better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/psychonucks"> /u/psychonucks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koukdh/could_rust_linting_be_instantaneous_or_much/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1koukdh/could_rust_linting_be_instantaneous_or_much/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;ve been working on a database-driven web application and often have structs that contain other structs like this:</p> <pre><code>type Currency struct { ID int ISOAlpha string ISONumber int Name string Exponent int } type Country struct { ID int Name string ISONumber int ISO2Code string ISO3Code string DialingCode string Capital string Currency Currency } </code></pre> <p>In the database, this is represented by a foreign key relation from the parent table to the child and I can then just do a select query with a join and Scan the result into a Country struct as follows:</p> <pre><code>var countryQuery string = ` select co.id, co.name, co.iso_number, co.iso2_code, co.iso3_code, co.dialing_code, co.capital, cu.id, cu.iso_alpha, cu.iso_number, cu.name, cu.exponent from countries co left join currencies cu on co.currency_id = cu.id where co.iso2_code = ? ` var country Country err := row.Scan( &amp;country.ID, &amp;country.Name, &amp;country.ISONumber, &amp;country.ISO2Code, &amp;country.ISO3Code, &amp;country.DialingCode, &amp;country.Capital, &amp;country.Currency.ID, &amp;country.Currency.ISOAlpha, &amp;country.Currency.ISONumber, &amp;country.Currency.Name, &amp;country.Currency.Exponent, ) </code></pre> <p>This works great and means I can get the entire struct with a single database call, even if I have multiple &quot;child&quot; structs. I&#39;m wondering though, what is the best way to do this if the foreign key relation is nullable? In this case I think the child struct needs to be a pointer like this:</p> <pre><code>type Country struct { ID int ... Currency *Currency } </code></pre> <p>Then, is it best to just query the currency separately and do a check to see if a row is returned before populating the Currency instance and assigning it to the Country struct? Obviously, this is an extra database call (or more if there&#39;s multiple potentially nullable child structs), or is there a better way to do this? I&#39;d like to stick to just using the built-in database/sql package if possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ocean6768"> /u/Ocean6768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kozxlq/best_way_to_select_from_a_database_into_a_struct/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kozxlq/best_way_to_select_from_a_database_into_a_struct/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve secured an interview with a company and project I would really like to work with after receiving a referral from someone who already works there and passing an initial technical test. I have been invited for an interview which they have said will be the last stage in the process before a decision is made. This is for an open job application, so there are other candidates. I am not sure if there is more than 1 available position open for the role.</p> <p>The technical test was a take home test and was easier than I expected, it felt like more of a filter to root out anyone who doesn&#39;t understand the fundamentals. Hence I am expecting more difficult technical questions to come up during this interview alongside the more interpersonal questions.</p> <p>I have been going back over things like my maths, programming patterns, and generally everything that I expect may come up from what I&#39;ve researched (there&#39;s some excellent resources from this subreddit, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9n847g/18_months_of_game_programming_interviews/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/xbcvvt/my_first_interviewing_experience_for_aaa_gameplay/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/190gnv2/what_kinds_of_questions_are_asked_in_a_gameplay/">3</a>). The one area I feel quite nervous about is if they potentially ask me to mock up a system design. It&#39;s not something I have had practise with doing on the spot in an interview scenario, and when I have done it before in a normal context it takes quite a bit of time of quiet thinking and trying things out before it starts to come together for me. I saw one comment about this here which was along the lines of &quot;we ask candidates to design Tetris&quot; and at this stage my mind would go completely blank if I was asked to do that on the spot. Is there any resources anyone knows about to help prepare for this area particularly?</p> <p>I am also hoping that someone will come along and assure me that the referral has already put me in a good stead and I just need to not completely fuck this up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WILLIAM_WALLACE_COCK"> /u/WILLIAM_WALLACE_COCK </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kp6wm8/got_an_interview_for_the_position_of_midlevel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kp6wm8/got_an_interview_for_the_position_of_midlevel/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>I‚Äôm a dev with 3+ years of professional experience and around 3 more years of personal coding time excluding my studies. (Fullstack dev) I‚Äôm not new to learning new things at all, for example, I recently learned C++ and built a VST plugin from scratch with no prior experience because I just wanted to.</p> <p>But game development? It‚Äôs like hitting a wall every time.<br/> I know the basics. I‚Äôve done Unity and Godot tutorials, written some basic scripts, and I‚Äôve got game ideas detailed in docs, mechanics, feel, gameplay loops, the whole deal. And I love games that let you build freely (V Rising, Valheim, Factorio, Garry&#39;s Mods etc.). I should be the perfect fit for this. (I even have a big catalogue of game assets I&#39;ve gotten from mostly Synty and random stuff that Humble Bundle throws your way, so I have resources to choose from)</p> <p>But when I open the editor to start something? Nothing. Zero motivation. I close it. Then I get upset at myself for not doing anything. It‚Äôs this loop, dream, plan, hesitate, guilt.</p> <p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coding issue. I like coding. I do it all day. So why does this particular area block me so hard? What am I missing?</p> <p>To veterans or anyone who‚Äôs gotten through this phase:<br/> Did you go through something similar?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago I had a conversation with an individual at my university campus who was a teacher at one of those private game development schools/universities that apparently once finished give you an actual degree in game development, by having you learn in-depth game programming, 3D/2D art &amp; asset creation, animation, ect.</p> <p>(mind you that private school need 30k in total in tuition fees and I&#39;m in EUROPE, not USA. It also is in total 3 years while my uni is 5 &amp; FREE)</p> <p>The conversation quickly turned into an argument because I feel that they are selling a scam disguised as a &quot;path towards your dream&quot; for many young people like me who want to get on game development.</p> <p>Let me state something about myself first of all and then my point.</p> <p>I&#39;m a university student, my major is in computer engineering &amp; informatics engineering, which you guessed it, has a specialisation path down towards software engineering and even more specialisation such as computer graphics. This is epic, cause In my part time I&#39;m a hobbist game developer who actually wants to go full time, create multiple good games and being able to do that as a full stack solo game developer, being able to live off of a passive income or even make my own studio one day. (+ I&#39;m already working on my first commerical project with a friend of mine in Godot. I do the programming, animation, asset creation &amp; texture work, while they work on the gameplay design &amp; game loop design)</p> <p>The argument started cause I stated that if you want to become an actual serious game developer you need to have an academic background in anything regarding computer science / informatics, simply because then you&#39;ll have the full background of the inner workings of a computer, it&#39;s operating systems, it&#39;s hardware and being able to utilise this knowledge alongside academic math &amp; your experience to be able to create games which are well optimised and can even utilise new technologies/software that you&#39;ve created.<br/> This aside, an academic degree, either masters or bachelors is something that&#39;s universally recognized and gives you job security, a &quot;game dev degree&quot; from a private school would be a risk, simply because you&#39;re not only narrowing down you specialisation drastically, you&#39;re at risk of not being able to find a job at all &amp; you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fully recognized by anyone. While with an academic degree you&#39;re able to find a job in the tech sector if you don&#39;t manage to get one in the game dev one right away, which ensures you&#39;ll still have time to devote to game development for a portfolio.</p> <p>He became very defensive and that said something along the lines that people don&#39;t have the time to waste learning anything else other than what interests them, that a game developer doesn&#39;t need to know more than how to program games.</p> <p>I just disagree, cause if you limit your knowledge in this sector, narrowing down only to the PRACTICAL part and not the THEORETICAL, a sector that is a by product of computer science &amp; applied mathematics, you&#39;ll be making the same, shitty slop all over again and again. Game development doesn&#39;t concern itself with just C#/C++. It also has a lot of other features that for example tap into computer communications (such as multiplayer games, basic server communication - while I know this is most of the time provided by the engine, it&#39;s important in my opinion to know what the fuck is going on).<br/> You won&#39;t be able to create advanced systems like for example the advanced enemy AI algorithms, complicated game mechanics such as the colossus climbing mechanic found in shadow of the colossus, set up a server hub or team assigning to create systems similar to games like League of legends for example.<br/> If you don&#39;t know the theory, you won&#39;t be able to spot patterns, flaws or logical errors, find more efficient work arounds or apply new technology, ect, you&#39;ll be stuck going in circles &amp; in 10 years you&#39;ll need to fuck off back into that private school for another 30k &amp; 3 years just to get onto the new stuff cause all the tools you&#39;ve been using suddenly now have changed. Not only this but you&#39;ll be, for your entire god damn life depended on the tools they taught you only how to use, making you very narrow in your job search &amp; vulnerable.</p> <p>While I OBVIOUSLY don&#39;t have the unrealistic ideals of one man army can create any AAA game in just a few years even with say 20/30 years of experience. I fully believe the most important and proper step into game dev is to first finish my academics which will give you the benefit of both knowledge and job security ( &amp; a recognized degree ), along side the ease of deep diving further into it&#39;s inner workings with ease, then you can advance by yourself.</p> <p>P.S. </p> <p>I don&#39;t refer to just &quot;Programming&quot; or knowing how to just program something. I&#39;m talking also about 2D/3D Vector mathematics in Calculus II, Linear Algebra, Graphics, GPU Architecture, Programming &amp; advanced data structures, C/C#C++, data bases &amp; computer communications, ect. They&#39;re all taught at my uni and they are fundemendal going into game development as it&#39;s literally built onto these.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea-Measurement2902"> /u/Sea-Measurement2902 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1koypga/im_i_wrong_for_thinking_game_dev_schools_are_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1koypga/im_i_wrong_for_thinking_game_dev_schools_are_not/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kowjz4/update_our_game_blew_up_on_itch_but_we_were_not/" target="_blank">Update: Our game blew up on Itch but we were not prepared for it</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Here‚Äôs the link to the original post in all detail, but I‚Äôll also give you a TLDR:</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k92de0/our_prototype_blew_up_on_itch_and_we_were_not/">Original Post</a></p> <p><strong>TLDR original post:</strong> We released a small side project called <em>Gamblers Table</em> on <a href="http://Itch.io">Itch.io</a>, and it unexpectedly <em>blew up</em>. It got a lot of traffic from the algorithm and made it to the Itch charts. This resulted in around 30k players and a bunch of comments asking for a full Steam release. However, player numbers gradually declined, and we didn‚Äôt have a Steam page to collect wishlists. So while it was amazing to get so much attention for something we made, it also felt like a missed opportunity because we couldn‚Äôt capture that interest.</p> <p>At the end of the original post, I shared our strategy to hopefully rekindle some of that initial interest ahead of the Steam page launch. Four weeks after the prototype release, we took the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>Launched the Steam page (in 9 languages)</li> <li>Commissioned proper key art from a professional artist</li> <li>Updated the demo with requested features like statistics, automation, QoL improvements, and accessibility settings</li> <li>Updated all assets on Itch</li> <li>Prepared Reddit posts for relevant genre hubs</li> <li>Shared mockup assets for planned features to give a clearer idea of the final game</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>As promised, here‚Äôs the update on how it went:</strong><br/> Long story short; we got 10,000 wishlists in under three weeks.</p> <p>Even though our main goal was to collect wishlists, we also linked the Itch prototype in the Reddit posts. This brought a lot of initial traffic to our Itch page, about half of the Day 1 traffic came from Reddit. That in turn reactivated the Itch io algorithm. We began rising in the charts and hit #1 in several sub-categories like ‚ÄúFor Web,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew &amp; Popular,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIdle,‚Äù and reached the top 10 in the overall popular charts.</p> <p>We were initially worried we‚Äôd only regain a small portion of the original audience - but in the end, we more than doubled our initial numbers. So far, nearly 120k people have visited the page, with around 80k plays.</p> <p>Here are some screenshots of the stats:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://imgur.com/MqDifEQ">All-time stats</a></li> <li><a href="https://imgur.com/SZTtHmv">Page launch traffic from Reddit</a></li> <li><a href="https://imgur.com/RG230oo">Page launch traffic from Itch</a></li> </ul> <p>The traffic curve on Itch looked about as expected: a big initial spike, slowly declining over time. The Steam wishlists followed a similar trend at first, we had a great first day with almost 900 wishlists, but the numbers dropped each day.</p> <p>But then luckily <em>Gamblers Table</em> was picked up by YouTubers. ImCade, a fairly big creator, made an amazing video that currently sits at 380k views, followed by several mid-sized YouTubers from different countries. ImCade‚Äôs video actually performed better than many of his recent uploads, which ranged from 50k-200k views.</p> <p>We used this as an example of how well the video can perform on Youtube to reach out to other YouTubers we know and like. The results were great, some already made videos, others asked us to follow up at full release, and some let us know that uploads are already scheduled. So, we‚Äôre hoping to see even more videos go live in the coming week(s).</p> <p>In terms of wishlists, this was a huge boost. We even exceeded the day-1 wishlist spike during the second week. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://imgur.com/V6eTsp2">chart of the daily wishlists</a>, it‚Äôs probably easier to understand than breaking down every spike.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we forgot to track Steam traffic with UTM links at launch and only added them about 10 days later. Still, we learned something useful: there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúWishlist on Steam‚Äù button in the game, visible at all times at the bottom of the screen. 85% of all tracked visits to Steam came from that button; the rest came mostly from the store text on Itch.</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/zjYKA4B">UTM Stats</a></p> <p>Interestingly, some web game sites re-uploaded the game without our permission. While we weren‚Äôt happy about that, the Wishlist button in their stolen version is still intact, so in a way, they‚Äôre still contributing to our Steam traffic.</p> <p><strong>What‚Äôs the main takeaway?</strong><br/> The big question we asked ourselves when the prototype got popular but we didn‚Äôt have a steam page was: Should you always have a steam page ready when you release something just in case it goes well? The fear was that you could miss your ‚Äúone shot‚Äù at attention.</p> <p>But the past days made me rethink this. Setting up a steam page can be a pretty big task and you need to pay for the page and ideally for an artist to make a decent key art for you. Posting a prototype on itch with low effort placeholder assets can still result in decent player numbers, and rekindling the interest was definitely possible. With Itch as a test balloon you can decide if going through the trouble of setting up a steam page is even worth it before committing too many resources.</p> <p>I hope this writeup was useful for you, if you have any question please don‚Äôt hesitate!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBossforge"> /u/TheBossforge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kowjz4/update_our_game_blew_up_on_itch_but_we_were_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kowjz4/update_our_game_blew_up_on_itch_but_we_were_not/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I love the idea of making video games but using unreal engine has killed this.</p> <p>I have a class for uni where we need to make a game in UE5, today I needed to do an assignment using the navmesh functionality in unreal... it took me like 5 hours to get the most basic shit working. The level of abstraction is insane, people explain how to use unreals features like it&#39;s a preschooler your convincing to eat their food.</p> <p>It&#39;s nondeterministic, everything is different every time. Just because the navmesh worked on my computer this morning does not mean it still works the same night.</p> <p>Before this class I loved everything about programming, I wanted to learn more about how everything works, but I hate all the abstraction on all of the tools we have to use. For context I love programming in C, in fact right now I&#39;m making a game in C from scratch using only SDL as a sort of hobby project. Rendering, lighting 3d projection all from scratch, and I love it. Is this cool? Yes. Does it have any practical value in game dev? No.</p> <p>Are all my skills wasted in game dev? Are there any game dev jobs that don&#39;t involve using a massively abstracted tool like unreal and I get to work with what&#39;s actually happening? I love using opengl, directx, and those sorts of things buy no one wants a opengl dev. Everyone hiring wants experience with unity or unreal and I despise the idea of trying to get someone else&#39;s badly documented tool to behave when I could just write one myself.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Hey everyone</strong>, we‚Äôre working (a 2-person team) on Worldwide Rush ‚Äì a game where you build and manage a global passenger transportation network.</p> <p>We wanted to share how the first week of our demo release went and how we achieved more than 10,000 wishlists in one week.</p> <p><strong>Here&#39;s how we achieved this:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>The Demo Itself:</strong> The demo was the first and most important thing. Initially, we wanted to release it in April, but we were delayed until May because initial testing revealed necessary improvements and features we needed to implement. We want to emphasize how crucial early playtesting and later feedback from players and YouTubers were. It provided invaluable insights and suggestions about what needed improvement and clearly showed us the direction we needed to take to make the game fun and enjoyable. <ul> <li><strong>Localization Paid Off:</strong> Localization proved to be very important and really paid off for us. We translated the game into 16 languages. We exclusively used freelancers who translated individually from English to their native language (except for Lithuanian, which we translated ourselves ‚Äì yes, we&#39;re from that country not everyone knows about üòÑ). This significantly boosted interest from Japan, Germany, Poland, France, the Netherlands, and many other regions.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Learning from Experts:</strong> A big thanks goes to Chris Zukowski and all his content. We truly recommend checking it out if you haven&#39;t already. Our decisions regarding the demo build and our plans for what comes next are largely guided by his recommendations and insights. <ul> <li><strong>Targeted Outreach &amp; Personalized Emails:</strong> We compiled a list of YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and news outlets who had previously covered or shown interest in similar games. Our goal was to reach people genuinely likely to enjoy Worldwide Rush. We created a short, simple email template ‚Äì no hype or exaggeration, just an honest description of the game and its origins ‚Äì included a press kit, and sent individual emails to everyone on our list. Then, we crossed our fingers.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Social Media Efforts (Still Learning!):</strong> We are regularly posting content on social media platforms (like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram), but we don&#39;t get much attention there. Honestly, we&#39;re still learning and are kinda bad at social media marketing! üòÑ</li> <li><strong>Paid Advertising Experiments (Meta vs. Reddit):</strong> <ul> <li>We previously tried Meta ads (Facebook and Instagram) with very little success. The engagement seemed low quality, almost like bots were clicking, and it didn&#39;t translate into meaningful wishlists. </li> <li>Trying Reddit ads felt like a breath of fresh air after that! We used a promotion where if you spent $500, you&#39;d get another $500 in free credit, and it worked really well for us. We saw positive comments directly on the ads, and the cost per wishlist seemed genuinely worth it. </li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Here&#39;s what happened:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>We Released a Demo:</strong> It&#39;s not perfect, but it helped introduce the mood and core idea of the game for people to try. </li> <li><strong>Got Some Press:</strong> A few outlets like PCGamesN, 4gamer, and GRYOnline wrote articles about us. This gave us a nice traffic boost. </li> <li><strong>Streamers &amp; YouTubers Jumped In:</strong> Some awesome content creators started playing the demo! If any of them by any chance sees this post, we want to say a huge shoutout and thanks to all of you ‚Äì you guys are amazing! </li> <li><strong>Steam Algorithm Took Notice:</strong> The traffic coming from press and streamers caught Steam&#39;s eye. We landed a spot in &#39;New &amp; Trending&#39; for demos which led to further promotion by Steam in other places, and in the end, we even got on the main page in the &#39;Trending Free&#39; spot and stayed there for a few days. This was incredible. </li> <li><strong>Good Demo Stats:</strong> The demo itself had pretty amazing statistics as well! <ul> <li>9000 players played the demo already. </li> <li>A median playtime of 45 minutes ‚Äì which we think is very good! </li> <li>At least 42% played for more than one hour and 24% played for at least 2 hours. Not to mention all of those who played for more than 20 hours.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>To conclude, we‚Äôre feeling incredibly grateful and motivated right now! If you&#39;ve tried the demo or have any questions about the journey, feel free to ask below! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ananass33"> /u/Ananass33 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kooktr/our_2person_teams_indie_game_hit_10000_wishlists/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kooktr/our_2person_teams_indie_game_hit_10000_wishlists/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s more of an ECS question than a Rust-specific question, so feel free to suggest another subreddit if you feel it&#39;s the wrong place.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of writing a turn-based strategy game and I&#39;m considering using Bevy for it, for fun and learning. My experience with Bevy, so far, is limited to minesweeper-level games, so I&#39;m far from being proficient either with Bevy or with ECS.</p> <p>Now, the main loop of this game is roughly:</p> <ul> <li>Player uses UI to play. <ul> <li>Most interactions will affect both the world&#39;s state (e.g. attacking an enemy unit or calling for reinforcements will add or remove a unit or change its state) and user-visible output (e.g. showing an animation and some sound FX during combat).</li> </ul></li> <li>Once Player clicks end of turn, each NPC faction plays in order. <ul> <li>Some stuff will trigger user-visible output.</li> </ul></li> <li>Once all NPC factions have played, back to previous state.</li> </ul> <p>I mostly see how I&#39;d write all of this manually, e.g. if I was developing a game from an event loop, but I don&#39;t have an idea of how to do this with ECS. Does anyone have suggestions or pointers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImYoric"> /u/ImYoric </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1koujb4/how_should_i_structure_a_turnbased_strategy_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1koujb4/how_should_i_structure_a_turnbased_strategy_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>
