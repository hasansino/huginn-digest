In a simplified fork of hashbrown I implemented cuckoo hashing and ran a wide range of experiments to understand when cuckoo hashing is better and when the more traditional quadratic probing is better. Answer: some form of cuckoo hashing is almost always best once you get to load factors above ~60%.</p> <p>By starting from hashbrown and changing only the probing scheme and nothing else, we are able to isolate just the effect of probing and not eg other metadata being stored in the table.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/reinerp123"> /u/reinerp123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://reiner.org/cuckoo-hashing">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ny15g3/cuckoo_hashing_improves_simd_hash_tables_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently implemented a niche self-describing serialization format in Rust and made a deserializer which didn&#39;t allocate to avoid memory-exhaustion attacks by malicious clients/servers. I noted the same techniques would apply to JSON, which would be far more useful to the community as a whole, so I built a RFC 8259-compliant deserializer which works with `core` alone.</p> <p>The README covers why in greater detail, including the methodology, with comparisons to other existing crates. The main comparable would be <a href="http://docs.rs/serde-json-core/">docs.rs/serde-json-core/</a> which does <em>not</em> support deserializing unknown fields and <em>requires</em> the type definition be known ahead of time. In comparison, `core-json` allows deserializing arbitrary objects at runtime with runtime checks for their type and dynamic conversion into typed objects.</p> <p>`core-json-traits` then provides the struct for deserializing into typed objects, with `core-json-derive` allowing automatically deriving `JsonDeserialize` for user-defined structs. This means it can be as easy to use as a `serde` deserializer, but with a bit more flexibility at runtime despite only requiring `core`. A long-term goal will presumably be to offer a feature-set comparable to `miniserde` while maintaining a more minimal (non-allocating) codebase itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kayabaNerve"> /u/kayabaNerve </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/kayabaNerve/core-json">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nxsq1w/corejson_a_nonallocating_nostd_json_deserializer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I have been working on an app to manage your expenses and budgets called Thunes. It is built with Rust, <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> and <a href="https://surrealdb.com/">Surrealdb</a>, and I wanted to share a little bit of my experience with all of those.</p> <ul> <li>SurrealDB</li> </ul> <p>SurrealDB is a multi-model database which can be integrated in a number of ways into your application. Data feels like JSON in surreal, thus modifying structures in-place during development is just a breeze. I think this is the most productive database I every used.</p> <p>You can spin-up different types of databases for the same interface, so for your application you can use <a href="https://rocksdb.org/">rocksdb</a> to store on disk, and for your tests use an in-memory database. I am unsure if this a good way to test, since both databases are different, but at least you don&#39;t have to handle cleaning up you tests data, which is convenient.</p> <p>However, serializing for SurrealDB was complicated sometimes, made me took weird design decisions for data architecture. One limitation I found is <strong>nested structures with records ids</strong>, which prevents you to query records which contains other records. Thus you have to store reference to parents in children structs and query a second time to get the parents. It&#39;s a <a href="https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/issues/4844">known bug</a>, and I hope it will be fixed soon.</p> <ul> <li>Tauri</li> </ul> <p>I started building desktop apps using electron a while ago, but was not a fan of writing js/ts for everything. Having the option to work with Rust is just perfect with Tauri. You can also use Rust for the frontend with frameworks like <a href="https://yew.rs/">Yew</a>.</p> <p>As much as I remember, Tauri is just easy to use. You generate your app with the CLI, choose the language for the backend, language and framework for the frontend, and build from there. Backend APIs are made with simple Rust macros that just work out of the box. Like SurrealDB, everything just feels productive.</p> <p>A little tip: to keep your types between Rust and Typescript synchronized, you can use the <a href="https://docs.rs/ts-rs/latest/ts_rs/">ts_rs</a> crate, which is also just a matter of exporting Rust types using simple macros.</p> <p>Check out the code on github if you are interested: <a href="https://github.com/ltabis/thunes">https://github.com/ltabis/thunes</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ltabis"> /u/ltabis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nxoi8m/building_a_budgeting_app_with_rust_tauri_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nxoi8m/building_a_budgeting_app_with_rust_tauri_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for feedback on a process I&#39;m working on at work. I am building out a lambda to take a zip file from S3, unzip it and upload it to our SQL Server database. The zip archive has 8 files ranging from 5MB to 40MB. Row counts are anywhere from a few thousand up to 100,,000. Its just a straight dump into a staging table and then stored procs merge into our final table. Each file gets routed to its own table. The file does come through as pipe delimited with double quote qualifiers with some fields being optional. So &quot;value1&quot;|&quot;value2&quot;|&quot;value3&quot;|&quot;&quot;|&quot;value4&quot;. </p> <p>Since its running in a lambda I&#39;m trying to process it all in memory. So I create a bufio scanner and go through line by line. I remove the double quotes and then have to add back in any blank values. I write the bytes to a buffer. Once I hit a certain number of rows, I create my insert statement with specifying multiple value statements and upload it to our database. SQL Server can only accept 2,100 parameters so I have to make sure the colums * rows is less than 2,100. So some batches end up being about 150 rows. I reset the buffer and start again. Memory wise I&#39;m able to use the minimum amount of memory.</p> <p>Ive got the whole process working, but its taking longer than expected. 3 of the smaller files are taking up to 3 minutes from start to finish. All 8 files will tskr maybe 10 minutes.</p> <p>Initially I was testing ingestion methods and I was able to load the files and print out all the individual insert statements as if each row was it&#39;s own statement and the whole process ran in under 45 seconds. So I&#39;m thinking my db uploads is the slowdown.</p> <p>Do these timings sounds relatively accurate? Not really looking for a direct code review ATM, moreso if the timings sound way too high or about normal. My code probably isn&#39;t the best, but I&#39;ve really been trying to optimize it. For example I try to do all the processing with the data as bytes and not strings. I use a sync pool of buffers to process the rows into the DB, so after every insert I reset it, put it back into the pool, and then get a new one.</p> <p>If anyone has any high level tips on the general process I&#39;d be more than appreciative.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CaptSprinkls"> /u/CaptSprinkls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ny4rob/file_scanning_and_database_uploads/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ny4rob/file_scanning_and_database_uploads/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am a big fan of Go + Svelte for a long time, love this connection (wrote about it multiple times already :D). Also a big fan of gRPC (type-safety, streaming, etc), but the setup was always painful, using SvelteKit (or any full-stack framework) server as a gateway to make it work was always bothering me ;/.</p> <p>Until I&#39;ve discovered ConntectRPC (<a href="https://connectrpc.com/">https://connectrpc.com/</a>). This shit is MAGICAL. Fixed all my problems. For those who don&#39;t know it, it is able to create both gRPC and HTTP-compatible endpoints. So browser &lt;-&gt; server is HTTP, server &lt;-&gt; server is gRPC. Did I mention great protobufs linting? Remote generation? Did you know modern browsers support streaming via standard HTTP? Yeah, it&#39;s amazing.</p> <p>Now for the static SvelteKit, you got all the benefits of the framework (routes, layouts, hooks, errors) without the additional, useless server call. Yeah, yeah, SSR is trendy (<a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/single-page-apps">https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/single-page-apps</a>), but for public facing sites. Otherwise try to prerender as much as possible, put it on Cloudflare Workers, and forget about it :D MUUUUCCH less headache, and no need to worry about all this &quot;hmm, will this secret be exposed to the client via some magic shit the framework is doing&quot;....</p> <p>As for Go? It&#39;s just the best, nothing to say here :D</p> <p>So yeah, try this combination, it&#39;s really amazing :)</p> <p>Now for the [self-promo] part, so feel free to skip it :):</p> <p>You might or might not saw my messages about my Go-focused CLI builder (<a href="https://gofast.live">https://gofast.live</a>). I am really happy with how it ended, a lot of configurations, multiple frontends (SvelteKit, NextJS, Vue, HTMX), HTTP + gRPC, payments, files, emails providers, Grafana monitoring, Kubernetes deployment....yeah, there is a lot.... the problem? You either get it ALL or nothing.</p> <p>So after the discovery of ConnectRPC, I&#39;ve decided to build a V2 version. And this time I want it to be like &quot;Lego Pieces&quot;. Won&#39;t spend much time writing all the ideas, cos it&#39;s BETA. But let&#39;s use an example to get the feeling :):</p> <p>```<br/> gof init my-app<br/> cd my-app<br/> gof client svelte<br/> gof model category title:string views:number published:time<br/> gof model post title:string content:string views:number published:time<br/> gof infra<br/> ```</p> <p>So by running these commands (lego pieces :D) you will end up with a fully working app, fully connected, with two new models, &quot;categories&quot; and &quot;posts&quot;, migrations, sql queries, service layer, transport layer, OAuth, all the way to the a functional CRUD UI scaffold, with list/add/edit/remove options for each model. This one is heavily inspired by the Elixir Phoenix (another amazing framework to check out ;) ).</p> <p>The CLI is smart, so you could even go with Go + models only first, and decide to add svelte at the end :p</p> <p>Have I mentioned that it will also auto generate all the tests? :D And ofc infra using terraform + auto deployment with CI/CD ... and so much more... yeah, I am excited about this one :D</p> <p>If any of this sounds interesting, hop on the Discord server, where we like talking about general modern web dev:</p> <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/EdSZbQbRyJ">https://discord.com/invite/EdSZbQbRyJ</a></p> <p>Happy for any more ideas and feedback :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bl4ckBe4rIt"> /u/Bl4ckBe4rIt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nxz9fg/cannot_praise_it_enough_go_connectrpc_static/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nxz9fg/cannot_praise_it_enough_go_connectrpc_static/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I don&#39;t know if this is a bad move or if there is another solution.</p> <p>The flow is already defined. Check prices -&gt; if prices reaches -&gt; notify user. But It doesn&#39;t end here because there could be another product posted that satisfies another user after the notification. So I need constant running.
