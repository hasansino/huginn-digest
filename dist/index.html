            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>And it was completely worth it. </p> <p>Yes - boxing errors works for getting something that technically does the core functionality of what you care about (in my case I&#39;m basically just writing a wrapper for OpenAI api calls). And yea I got something working, and I really could have left it that way with a bunch of really fugly &quot;Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&quot;s all over the place (ew).</p> <p>But but but something primal in me &quot;NO! THAT&#39;S THE DEVIL&quot; so I ended up spending ages getting all my wrappers neatly tied up with the special errors that I wanted. And the code is so much better now and I caught a couple of places where I could have had a panic that would have brought my whole server down. Plus I found a stupid case where one api call failing would cause all the rest of them to fail.

For years, I have been using the native blog note app from windows to take notes or elaborate ideas, but I always thought it needed a bit more of customization, like a title, list or a section separator.</p> <p>I searched like a maniac for like 10 minutes, I downloaded like 4 desktop apps, and they just were an overkill if you ask me or very different that I was used to.</p> <p>Maybe I would have found one that fit my needs if I searched for 15 minutes instead, but heck, I am a developer who is also learning rust. So I took the opportunity of a lifetime (since every decision you take, meaningless or otherwise, is an opportunity of a lifetime), installed Tauri 2.0 and of course added Svelte because why not?</p> <p>So far, what I like the most is that you can have a highlight of the name and path of the file you are in and go to them in the explorer if clicked. I am also in the process of developing a file tracker so you can see the history of files you opened and categorize them inside the app.</p> <p>This is an open source project, so if anybody has any feature suggestion, report bugs, improve what already exists or just any form of feedback is more than welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/foottaster123"> /u/foottaster123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mb2nq3/fist_rust_project_and_open_source_not_just/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mb2nq3/fist_rust_project_and_open_source_not_just/">[comments]</a></span></div>

One of mine is that I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s still worth the time waiting for the code to compile when it&#39;s not a performance-critical service, and I could just use something like Elixir, F#, Go, etc.</p> <p>I&#39;m still choosing Rust for this because I really love the language and don&#39;t mind the process of creating my own &#39;frameworks and libraries&#39; where the ecosystem lacks maturity. I did the same with Go eight years ago, and it wasn&#39;t as difficult to create the libraries as people think. So, I believe I can use Rust just fine for general back-end development. My only regret is when compilation takes too long, and I feel the slower feedback loop for quickly launching features I need.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Outside_Loan8949"> /u/Outside_Loan8949 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mb0im2/what_do_you_feel_rust_is_not_a_good_option_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mb0im2/what_do_you_feel_rust_is_not_a_good_option_for/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Everyone I wanna ask as I am just a beginner and have past in JavaScript/typescript but now I really wanna do something big in web development with innovations but when I try to to that level of complex and large tasks in js/ts, it totally failed for me and I think js/ts is more wonderful for frontend than backend. Later I started exploring a programming language which has versatile features for developing large, fast, feature full and complex backend. Then I came to know about Go and Rust. But When I explored about these two language and compare them through chatgpt and internet, I came to know that rust has steep learning curve but it has long term benifit and it&#39;s Future proof whereas Golang is also mature enough but it has Gc pauses and it&#39;s not much powerful than rust in terms of performance &amp; security and also lacked many things for creating a powerful and versatile backend and for innovation. I just want one backend language to manage all backend tasks efficiently and wanted to keep my programming stack as simplified as I can. So I do not want to invest time in multiple programming languages and later I will become a overhead for me. I donot mean for me whether a language has hard or easy learning curve. I just want to choose a right next language and wanna deep dive into it for years. So what you will suggest me. Does I am thinking correct? Should you recommend me other programming language or any tip? </p> <hr/> <hr/> <p>Thanks rust communityüë•üë•üë• for your advises it helped a lot. I analysed all comments and came to know that I have to focus on specific area not on a diverse product from starting and I think I have to invest more time in js/ts for backend development and later I will adopt golang because many comments are telling me that golang is enough for many web related tasks and it is possible to complete complex tasks with it easily that I will do with much effort with rust. I also learned that programming language doesn&#39;t matter as anything can be achieved with focus on product. </p> <p>Thanks‚ù§üôèonce again! :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FinalChemist227"> /u/FinalChemist227 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mah45w/should_i_choose_rust_as_my_second_language/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mah45w/should_i_choose_rust_as_my_second_language/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I also wanted the ability to manage bandwidth usage. What I came up with does the job pretty well and can easily be expanded to support other cloud providers. <strong>I wouldn&#39;t call it &#39;production ready&#39;</strong> by any means, but it does the job.</p> <p>While the service itself **should** work on Windows/Mac, it hasn&#39;t been tested, and the install script is meant for a Linux host running systemd. I included a Docker-Compose file as well, should anyone want to run it as a container (although you will have to work out the permissions for your use case yourself).</p> <p>It has no frontend or graphical interface (although I have considered doing something with wails), but does expose a /metrics endpoint that is compatible with prometheus/grafana.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/aaronlmathis/CloudAWSync">https://github.com/aaronlmathis/CloudAWSync</a></p> <h1>CloudAWSync - Cloud File Synchronization Agent</h1> <p>CloudAWSync is a cloud file synchronization agent written in Go.

There are also a few useful new features like you can now show a plot fullscreen. The frontend gets compressed and embedded (<code>go:embed</code>) into your binary, to which less than 1MB gets added. We&#39;ll make sure to keep it that way.</p> <p>There are new plots with recently added <code>runtime/metrics</code></p> <p>The number of plots is relatively important and you&#39;re rarely interested by looking at all plots at the same time, plots have now been grouped into categories, so you can decide what plot categories to be looking at, like GC, runtime, etc.</p> <p>I gladly accept feedback.</p> <p>edit: formatting</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/arainone"> /u/arainone </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mam6m3/httpsgithubcomarlstatsviz/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mam6m3/httpsgithubcomarlstatsviz/">[comments]</a></span></div>
