Each module includes unit tests that double as usage examples, and the documentation is enriched with inline code and doctests.</p> <p>Right now, I&#39;m focusing on expanding the DataFrame and CSV functionality.

Also this tree can grow to an arbitrary large size</p> <p>The naive implementation would be to use <code>vec.push</code> every time I add a node, and this would cause reallocation in case the vector exceeds capacity.</p> <p>During an interview where I got asked to implement a tree I used the above mentioned approach and I got a code review saying that relying on vector reallocation is bad, but the interviewer refused to elaborate further.</p> <p>So my questions are: - Is relying on reallocation bad? - If yes, what could be the alternatives?</p> <p>The only alternative I could come up with would be to use a jagged array, like <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Node&gt;&gt;</code>, where each <code>Vec&lt;Node&gt;</code> has a fixed maximum size, let&#39;s say <code>RowLength</code>.</p> <p>Whenever I would reach capacity I would allocate a <code>Vec&lt;Node&gt;</code> of size <code>RowLength</code>, and append it to the jagged array. The jagged array could experience reallocation, but it would be cheap because we are dealing with pointers of vectors, and not the full vector.</p> <p>To access <code>NodeID</code> node, I would access <code>arena[row][column]</code>, where row is <code>(NodeID as u64) % RowLength</code> and column is <code>(NodeID as u64) / RowLength</code></p> <p>In this case I would reduce the cost of reallocation, in exchange for slightly slower element access, albeit still <code>o(1)</code>, due to pointer indirection. </p> <p>Is this approach better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/servermeta_net"> /u/servermeta_net </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mfttwo/is_vector_reallocation_bad_arena_tree/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mfttwo/is_vector_reallocation_bad_arena_tree/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Just released a new version of my cryptography crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/aes_crypto"><code>aes_crypto</code></a> (pls don&#39;t judge for the clich√© name, I am not good at coming up with names). I will be thankful if you can provide some feedback on it so I can improve it even more ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p> <p>Although there are a lot of crates out there that implement the famous AES cipher (most notably the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/aes"><code>aes</code></a> crate, which was kind of the inspiration for this project), none of them provide sufficient control over the nitty-gritties of AES. If you are familiar with recent developments in symmetric cryptography, there has been a surge of cryptographic algorithms that use the AES <em>round functions</em> as a primitive, mostly because there is a lot of hardware support for this.</p> <p>What this crate aims to do is provide an uniform API over all hardware (and software) implementations (which I couldn&#39;t find much about in the ecosystem, there is the <code>hazmat</code> module in the <code>aes</code> crate, but it is seriously underpowered, and doesn&#39;t do justice to the <em>extremely</em> performant hardware implementations).</p> <p>Another highlight of this crate is support for <em>vectorized</em> AES (i.e. multiple AES calls in parallel). Currently there is only 1 hardware-accelerated implementation of vector AES, which uses the X86 VAES instructions (it is currently nightly-only, but I plan to make it available on stable too once 1.89 comes out).</p> <p>Just a warning at the end, this is meant to be used as a cryptographic primitive for implementing higher-level cryptographic algorithms in a platform-independent (and performant) manner. One shouldn&#39;t use this without sufficient knowledge of cryptography.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Harbinger-of-Souls"> /u/Harbinger-of-Souls </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/aes_crypto">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mfnbnl/new_crate_aes_crypto/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am currently developing a top-down 2D exploration game and it has gotten to a point in development where I am willing to show it to friends and family. The problem is that the game currently doesn&#39;t have a name, something I&#39;ve put off until now because I didn&#39;t want to commit to a low-quality name early in development. I would really appreciate it if y&#39;all could recommend some names based on my description below! </p> <p>The game is in an art style adjacent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler">Octopath Traveller</a>, a 2.5D environment with nostalgic 2D sprites. It is open-world with long-distance travel being restricted to the player&#39;s progression through the storyline, culminating in an entirely open map that I will populate over time with side quests to enjoy both during and after the storyline. Most of the scripted combat is loosely turn-based while boss fights and NPC combat are real-time. </p> <p>The first unique element of the game that stands out to the player is the Revival mechanic I have implemented. When the player dies, they are revived and given a temporary boost in strength and skill for the remainder of their fight, with the cost being the corruption of their body. The amount of times you can die before succumbing to the corruption depends on the method in which you die, with the game even allowing you to take yourself out to trigger Revival. In the late stages of Revival&#39;s corruption, you are visibly disfigured and shunned/attacked by normally friendly NPCs, and the only way to cure yourself is to travel to one of select few healers that can restore your body. The cost of the Revival mechanic is that checkpoints are sometimes hours apart, meaning that if you aren&#39;t careful you could lose some serious progress in the game.</p> <p>A less obvious unique element of the game is the lore of the world and its magic which is heavily inspired by apocalyptic Jewish and Christian works. In my story, the world is separated between material and spiritual realms. The two realms function in entirely different ways to the player and you have to travel between them multiple times in the story. The issue is that mortals aren&#39;t supported to enter the spiritual realm and spirits aren&#39;t supposed to enter the material realm, and breaking this rule can lead to catastrophic consequences. You eventually discover that Revival is one of many powers that came into existence after angels, distinctly spiritual beings, entered the material realm and produced offspring with mortal women, producing in their birth unstable souls that belong to both realms. You, the main character, are one of those children who was abandoned after the angels were forced to return to their own realm. All of the bosses you fight in the series are also children who were abandoned, and they have caused massive problems in the world as a direct result of the angels breaking the strict dichotomy.</p> <p>So yeah, I&#39;ve been having a hard time coming up with a good name for the game. Here are my current ideas:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Welkin Journey</strong>, literally &quot;Heaven Journey&quot; but less generic sounding.</li> <li><strong>Revival of Alice</strong>, because I kind of want to name the main character Alice and make an obscene amount of references to Alice in Wonderland.</li> <li><strong>Revival of Renae</strong>, rolls off your tongue and the name Renae literally means &quot;revive&quot;.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Duel05"> /u/Duel05 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mg4xd9/what_should_i_name_my_halfcompleted_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mg4xd9/what_should_i_name_my_halfcompleted_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings. My name is Delvix000 and I am a long time game developer. I am from italy and I have been a solo developer since my adolescence. I created my first game called &quot;Whiteman Commando&quot; about 15 years ago with GameMaker. It gained a lot of popularity in the italian GameMaker community back in the day, and I developed 4 more titles for the same series. Now that I am adult I wanted to send some curriculums around the world. However, I fear that the name &quot;Whiteman Commando&quot; may be misinterpreted by some people and job recruiters, especially americans, and it may give a bad light to me. I was considering to rebrand the games to a similar name like &quot;WhiteMetal Commando&quot; or something like that, in order to put those in the curriculum. A the same time, I fell sorry for destroying the legacy of a game that was loved by many italian players and that defined the beginning of my career as an indie game developer.</p> <p>What should I do?</p> <p>Also, honestly, do you think a title like &quot;Whiteman Commando&quot; might be misinterpreted? The game follows the story of a futuristic soldier in a white metallic suit that fights against cybernetic organisms. The fact that it&#39;s a white armor came from the fact that when I was a kid, i used to craft small paper soldiers and play with those. Whiteman was one of those paper soldiers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delvix000"> /u/Delvix000 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mfwzxx/is_it_morally_correct_to_change_the_game_of_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mfwzxx/is_it_morally_correct_to_change_the_game_of_my/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve been given a task to screen dump we some of our digital screens are showing as we are a small adverting company. Some screens have a Windows OS playing the content and some have Linux. The Linux side is already grabbing what&#39;s on the screen to stdout and comparing the colours to make sure things are chnaging on the screen and not frozen, nice.</p> <p>Now I&#39;ve been asked to try this on a Windows backend. The chap who did the Linux side simply said:</p> <blockquote> <p>So the powershell script can be embedded in the Go binary, written to powershell&#39;s stdin where it reads it, does the capture and dumps the image on stdout </p> <p> That way we don&#39;t even have to deploy a separate powershell script. Of course, if the powershell script can dump a raw image to stout then saving it to disk, if you want to do that is as easy as <code>powershell .\scriptname.ps1 &gt; C:\Temp\image.jpg.</code> It can be compiled on yourMac/PC then put on the Windows player using GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o program.go</p> </blockquote> <p>I was like right ok.......</p> <p>I thought I need to look into this. I have a powershell script I created to dump the screenshot to the c:\temp currently that&#39;s it. However is he correct? Rather than get powershell to dump a jpeg, can I run this in Goland and run as a service? I really just want the screendump to happen every 10&#39;s then look to compare the screenshots and if they are not changing then log this.</p> <p>I&#39;m one of those people that needs to see this to understand rather that someone just say it to me. I need to understand what next steps I need to do from here and use my Powershell script with Go.</p> <p>If I&#39;ve explained it right is what he is saying possible?</p> <p>Maybe someone can explain as if I&#39;m a 10 year old might help :)</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hammerfist1990"> /u/Hammerfist1990 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mfu07o/novice_question_if_thats_ok_using_powershell/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mfu07o/novice_question_if_thats_ok_using_powershell/">[comments]</a></span></div>
