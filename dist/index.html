Several of you pointed out that RefCell in particular easily cause more problems than it gain. Some suggested going for an ECS-based design.</p> <p>I have now refactored the entire data model, moved around the OngoingMatch as well as the ensuring there are no circular references between a Lineup playing an OngoingMatch to a Team of a Manager that has an OngoingMatch. Everything is now changed back to the original &amp; references with minimal lifetime annotations, by keeping track using Uuids for all objects instead. I have still opted out from using a true ECS framework.</p> <p>Approximately 1.400 of the ~4.300 LoC were affected, and it took a while to get it through the compiler again. But lo and behold! Once it passed, there were only 4 (!) minor regressions affecting 17 LoC!</p> <p>Have I said I love Rust?</p> <p>The screenshot shows just a plain HTML dump for my own testing in order to visualize the data.</p> <p>Next up: Getting the players to actually pass the ball around.

What&#39;s a good rule of thumb to use when trying to decide which one to use?</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>trait Entity&lt;I&gt; { id(&amp;self) -&gt; I; } trait Entity { type Id; id(&amp;self) -&gt; Self::Id; } </code></pre> <p>With this example, the generic parameter means you can implement <code>Entity</code> multiple times for a type, so long as you use different ID types. Meanwhile, the associated parameter means there can be only one Entity implementation for a type, however you&#39;re no longer able to know that type from a caller that is only knows about a dynamic Entity and not its concrete type.</p> <p>Are there any other considerations when deciding or is this the only difference? And is there a way to bridge the gap between both, where you can allow only one implementation of <code>Entity</code> while also knowing the ID type from the caller?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tuckertcs"> /u/Tuckertcs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kracoo/when_to_use_generic_parameters_vs_associated_types/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kracoo/when_to_use_generic_parameters_vs_associated_types/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was putting together an async+diesel project and I suddenly realized: diesel is not async! I could have switched to the async_diesel crate, but then I thought, how hard can it be to wrap db calls in an async fn? This is where I ended up:</p> <pre><code>// AnyHow Error Maker fn ahem&lt;E&gt;(e: E) -&gt; anyhow::Error where E: Into&lt;anyhow::Error&gt; + Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug { anyhow::anyhow!(e) } use diesel::r2d2::{ConnectionManager, Pool, PooledConnection}; type PgPool = Pool&lt;ConnectionManager&lt;PgConnection&gt;&gt;; type PgPooledConn = PooledConnection&lt;ConnectionManager&lt;PgConnection&gt;&gt;; // This is it! pub async fn qry&lt;R,E&gt;(pool: PgPool, op: impl FnOnce(&amp;mut PgPooledConn) -&gt; Result&lt;R,E&gt; + Send + &#39;static) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;R&gt; where R: Send + &#39;static, E: Into&lt;anyhow::Error&gt; + Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug { tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || { pool.get().map_err(ahem) .and_then(|mut c | op(&amp;mut c ).map_err(ahem)) }).await? } </code></pre> <p>And to call it: <code>qry(pool.clone(), |c| lists.load::&lt;List&gt;(c)).await?;</code></p> <p>I was surprised how straightforward it was to write that function. I wrote a &#39;naive&#39; version, and then the compiler just told me to add trait bounds until it was done. I love this language.</p> <p>My guess is this approach will not survive moving to transactions, but I&#39;m still proud I solved something on my own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/7Geordi"> /u/7Geordi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kr8eej/how_i_run_queries_against_diesel_in_async_anyhow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kr8eej/how_i_run_queries_against_diesel_in_async_anyhow/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I‚Äôve been using Go for a few years and every time I start a new project I struggle with the project structure and overthink things.

So every time I receive a specific request I have to get all the entities to instantiate a repository for each one, which makes a RPC request in a p2p server.</p> <p>I don‚Äôt like the idea of instantiating new repositories for every request, since it will always be the same values regardless of the user, it will only change the value received from the user to make the request.</p> <p>Has anyone ever been through a similar situation?

That&#39;s the core idea behind <code>chatsh</code> ‚Äì making your terminal a conversational workspace.</p> <p>üí¨ <strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li>üó£Ô∏è <strong>Conversational Shell:</strong> Manage chat rooms using filesystem-inspired commands (<code>ls</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pwd</code>, <code>touch</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>cp</code>). It feels like navigating your file system, but for chats!</li> <li>‚úçÔ∏è <code>vim</code>**-like Chat UI:** Once you <code>vim &lt;room_name&gt;</code>, you enter a modal, <code>vim</code>-inspired interface for a focused, real-time chat experience.</li> <li>üíª <strong>Terminal Native:</strong> No need to switch to another application; your chats live right where you do your work.</li> <li>üîó <strong>Go &amp; gRPC Powered:</strong> Built entirely in Go (both client and server) with gRPC and bidirectional streaming for efficient, real-time communication.</li> <li>üóÇÔ∏è <strong>Persistent Rooms:</strong> Chat rooms are persistent on the server, so you can pick up conversations where you left off.</li> </ul> <p>üí° <strong>Why</strong> <code>chatsh</code>**?**</p> <p>I created <code>chatsh</code> to address the constant context-switching I found myself doing between my terminal (where I spend most of my development time) and various separate chat applications. My goals were to:</p> <ul> <li>Enable quick, project-related discussions without leaving the command line.</li> <li>Make the terminal environment a bit more collaborative and less isolated.</li> <li>Have a fun project to explore Go&#39;s capabilities for CLI tools and networking with gRPC.</li> </ul> <p>Essentially, <code>chatsh</code> aims to be your go-to interface for both productive work and engaging discussions, all within one familiar window.</p> <p><strong>üì¶ Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/ponyo877/chatsh"><strong>https://github.com/ponyo877/chatsh</strong></a></p> <p>üé¨ <strong>Demo:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/F_SGUSAgdHU"><strong>https://youtu.be/F_SGUSAgdHU</strong></a></p> <p>I&#39;d love to get your feedback, bug reports, feature suggestions, or just hear your general thoughts!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching RPG Limit Break this week. (Seriously it&#39;s good stuff, check it out.) and it reminds me of something I&#39;ve read too many times. A really bad idea of &quot;How do I give speedrunners a good experience?&quot; </p> <p>You don&#39;t.</p> <p>Two points. First Speedrunners are NOT your core audience. There&#39;s only going to be a few of them, but they&#39;ll only run your game if it&#39;s fun. </p> <p>Do you want to support the 10 guys who buy your game once and just play it like crazy. You might say &quot;Exposure&quot; but a lot of games are just &quot;Speedrunning games&quot; That people watch speedruns for but don&#39;t really play themselves. It&#39;s kind of the same problem of &quot;Streamer games&quot;. Tons of people watch streamers for the streamer not necessarily for the game.</p> <p>Or do you support 1,000-100,000 players, who really enjoy the game, and hope to find those 10 obsessive people who will just keep playing your game to see how fast they can beat it? (it&#39;s the later... you&#39;ll sell more, you&#39;ll make more money, and even if speedrunning doesn&#39;t start to happen, you&#39;ll have a game more people will want.) </p> <p>&quot;But what about My Friend Pedro&quot; Well two problems, that game really struggles (story, level design) because of it&#39;s speedrunning setup (though that&#39;s a subjective opinion) but more importantly, that&#39;s not &quot;Speed running&quot; that&#39;s time attack with leaderboards. </p> <p>The second and bigger thing is that speedrunners love to break your game, a lot of their enjoyment IS the breaking your game or pushing what they can do. It is going faster than you expected. It is about finding a glitch you didn&#39;t take care of. Not a glitch you left in the game, but a glitch you didn&#39;t expect. </p> <p>If your game is popular and speedrunners start to run it, reach out, figure out what they can use (usually cutscene skips and an on-screen timer). But really, this is post launch/release, and the goal is to remove important barriers that slow down the runs outside of gameplay.</p> <p>This is the same mentality of &quot;pre-mature optimization&quot;. Until you know you need to do it, don&#39;t do it. The fact is speedrunners run games that they enjoy, and until you make a game they&#39;ll enjoy, it&#39;s much more important to make a great game. </p> <p>And just to be clear, this isn&#39;t saying &quot;don&#39;t make a game based on time attack&quot; But make a good game more than anything. Neon White is a brilliant game based on time attack. It&#39;s not designed about speedrunners, but around the fluid controls that are all about speed. </p> <p>There&#39;s a number of great Indies, who have helped their speedrunning community AFTER launch. And while it sounds like a chicken or the egg problem, it&#39;s not. </p> <p>So the flow is Make a Good Game &gt; Speedrunners get interested (Hopefully) &gt; You add minor features specifically for speedrunning &gt; Speedrunners get more interested (Hopefully).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kinglink"> /u/Kinglink </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1krc0s7/dont_focus_on_speedrunning_support_them_whenif_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1krc0s7/dont_focus_on_speedrunning_support_them_whenif_it/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pretty much the title, I have no friends xD</p> <p>For some context on April first I decided to start making games. Figured I would learn and build a small scale RPG in the style of skyrim, and release it to steam as a way to learn the entire process and turn it into a career. Nothing big, no delusions of grandeur just slowly build a self sustaining solo studio eventually over many years. I had a PC, I&#39;ve been gaming my whole life, my siblings are gamers and we talk daily, My wife made me stay home with our toddlers cause she wanted to work. I now have infinite free time for the next three years (household duties first obviously) so i figured why not.</p> <p>Everything is actually going smooth AF using unreal 5.5 as I have zero background in anything involved. From blank project I got a random character model. cool. gave it input and got it moving, free animations later I have a whole locomotion system. Everything just kept clicking and it was great. Family seemed into it. Fast forward to now we have free movement when unarmed and strafe locomotion when armed. Got most of the RPG stuff so we have stats, equippables in all armor and weapon flavors, consumables, player UI, inventory with tabs, crafting, item upgrades, random stats for all items (or static for special ones), rarity tiers, randomly generated loot from enemies and chests, doors that open, locked doors and chests that open with unique keys, Custom 4 hit combo animations for sword/shield and two handed attacks with working line tracing so it&#39;s all coming together nicely. The problem is now when I bring it up to my brothers I&#39;m flat out ignored. I was updating when I got something cool working to no feedback and now I&#39;m just talking to the wall. I don&#39;t have friends so there&#39;s really no place for me to find feedback, sure I could do it alone and i have been alone, but I kinda want someone to talk to about it and bounce ideas with.</p> <p>I&#39;m the definition of new so is it even okay for me to be here?</p> <p>I also had no idea what I was doing and already launched a kickstarter to get some models and music for the game, I was already bullied for the obvious blunder but if you want to hear about it I can share that as a hazing ritual </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HomebrewedVGS"> /u/HomebrewedVGS </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1krb8fz/do_yall_accept_strays_that_just_want_to_hang_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1krb8fz/do_yall_accept_strays_that_just_want_to_hang_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Before I started developing games 1.5 years ago, I just wanted to make my games. Now I realize that making games is only 10% of it. If we want to make money, we need to have a lot of different skills.</p> <ul> <li>Team Management. If you are not a solo developer you will need to build a team. The most important thing you need to know is leadership and team management. Especially if you convince people to work with zero money like my team. </li> <li>Marketing. If you don&#39;t have a teammate or a publisher to do it, you will have to do it yourself. If you are not very lucky or you don&#39;t have a great idea that will come in one in a million, you will not be able to sell that game without marketing. </li> <li>Social media. You can think of it as part of marketing, but social media requires a specific knowledge. </li> <li>Video and illustration design. Your game may not contain a lot of art. But I believe this is a necessity for your game&#39;s Steam page to be in the best form. You need a very good trailer and capsule art. </li> <li>Narrative design. This is perhaps the most overlooked art, especially in indie games. When we mention art, game developers think of drawing and music. But they forget that literature is also an art. If you skip the story part, it means that if you don&#39;t have a very, very good mechanic, you will be missing a piece. </li> <li>Localisation. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll want to publish your game in different languages. But if you only translate, it will bring more harm than profit. Because translation is not localisation. You need to know the difference.</li> <li>Project management. If you have a team, you need to prepare a plan to manage them. You need to have weekly meetings, assign tasks to everyone, get to know people, choose the people you want to bring on board and move forward. </li> <li>Public speaking. This is a must-have feature. There is no such thing as &quot;I can make my game without seeing anyone and I will be discovered&quot;. This is a dream. You need to present yourself to people. </li> <li>Business. This is the most boring part. If you are going to make a game and make money from it, you need to be ready for a lot of paperwork. </li> </ul> <p>Can you think of any other boring skills that we have to do?
