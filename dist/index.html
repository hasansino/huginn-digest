There&#39;s no separate orchestrator to host and run so you can incrementally add it to an existing Go app without rearchitecting it.

I am currently trying to do something about self-referencing structs from this article: <a href="https://appliedgo.com/blog/generic-interface-functions">https://appliedgo.com/blog/generic-interface-functions</a></p> <p>Was wondering if you guys have any ideas on how to embed this to structs with methods? I think you cannot have generic struct methods, so I felt that I am stuck <del>doing this</del> on being able to do this.</p> <p>Maybe minimal example...?: ``` package main</p> <p>import ( &quot;fmt&quot; )</p> <p>type doer[T any] interface { do() T }</p> <p>type foo int type bar int type baz int</p> <p>func (f foo) do() foo { return f } func (b bar) do() bar { return b } func (b baz) do() baz { return b }</p> <p>type thingWithDoer[T doer[T]] struct { t []T }</p> <p>// cannot use generic type thingWithDoer[T doer[T]] without instantiation // (adding parameters here isn&#39;t allowed...) func (t thingWithDoer) workWithThing() {}</p> <p>func main() { // cannot use generic type doer[T any] without instantiation _ = thingWithDoer[doer]{t: []doer{foo(0), bar(0), baz(0)}} fmt.Println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) } ```</p> <p>Is this a limitation to Go&#39;s type system, or is there a trick that I am missing? Thanks!</p> <hr/> <p>Edit: If you guys haven&#39;t saw the article, this is the rough implementation of the self-referencing interface: ``` type Cloner[T any] struct { Clone() T }</p> <p>...</p> <p>func CloneAny[T Cloner[T]](c T) { return c.Clone() } ```</p> <p>In this code snippet, Cloner is bounded to return itself, which is enforced by CloneAny(...).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/regSpec"> /u/regSpec </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1npf95o/have_read_about_selfreferencing_interfaces/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1npf95o/have_read_about_selfreferencing_interfaces/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It was a lesson in what not to do: slow, allocation-heavy, and deceptively incorrect. This <a href="https://matttproud.com/blog/posts/go-maphash.html">article is a retrospective on that mistake</a> ‚Äî a cautionary tale for anyone who thinks hashing complex types is straightforward.</p> <p>My quest for a proper implementation led me down a deep rabbit hole of manual hashing, recreating classic patterns with magic prime numbers and painstaking logic to handle pointers, slices, and maps. This journey revealed just how many subtle ways you can shoot yourself in the foot, creating accidental collisions or non-deterministic behavior. I&#39;ve chronicled these pitfalls so you can learn what not to do.</p> <p>Thankfully, this story has a happy ending, thanks to Go&#39;s (relatively new) <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/hash/maphash"><code>package maphash</code></a>. It provides an elegant, performant, and idiomatic API that handles much of the nuance for you.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I released/announced the first version of Samoyed about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mg52la/announcing_samoyed_a_git_hooks_manager_written_in/">2 months ago</a>.</p> <pre><code>$ cargo install samoyed --version 0.2.0 $ samoyed init </code></pre> <p>The first version was working, but it was over-engineered and had unnecessary complexity and needed a significant rewrite.</p> <p>Today I released <a href="https://crates.io/crates/samoyed">Samoyed 0.2.0</a>. I rebuilt the project around a single-file core to make the code easier to read, maintain, and evolve. The diff from v0.1.17 removes 11,785 lines and adds 6,183. <em>The added files are almost all POSIX shell scripts for integration testing.</em></p> <p>Now there&#39;s only a single Rust file in the project: <a href="https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/blob/v0.2.0/src/main.rs">main.rs</a>, which is only about 500 lines of code (comments included), and 1200 lines of code if we also count the unit tests.</p> <p>As mentioned earlier and in the <a href="https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/blob/v0.2.0/LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file, Samoyed is inspired by Husky. However unlike Husky, it doesn&#39;t depend on a JavaScript runtime environment (Node, Bun, Deno, etc.). Just put <code>samoyed</code> on the PATH and it works. So depending on how we calculate Samoyed and Husky&#39;s footprint, we can argue it is much &quot;smaller&quot; than Husky. Unlike real-life Samoyed dogs.</p> <p>Performance wise, even though native compiled code is much faster than running JavaScript on our machines, hooks are most often written in a shell scripting language such as POSIX shell and Python so beyond <code>samoyed init</code>, performance of your hooks is not dependent on Samoyed.</p> <p>Samoyed 0.2.0 is not backwards compatible with 0.1.17 as it no longer supports <code>samoyed.toml</code>. However for the next version, I am planning to integrate it with Cargo (an optional feature), so you should be able to write your hooks in <code>Cargo.toml</code> (or maybe in <code>Samoyed.toml</code>) and manage them using the <code>cargo</code> command.</p> <h2>Samoyed is now self-reliant</h2> <p>I use Samoyed to manage Samoyed&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/nutthead/samoyed/tree/v0.2.0/.samoyed">git hooks</a>.</p> <h2>Next steps (soon)</h2> <ul> <li>Fix an issue in the release pipeline that causes Rustdocs not to be published to crates.io</li> <li>Polishing and refactoring the code (and <code>README.md</code>)</li> </ul> <h2>Next steps (a bit later)</h2> <ul> <li>Publish <code>.deb</code>, <code>.rpm</code>, and Windows installer packages</li> <li>Publish Samoyed to Homebrew and Chocolatey</li> </ul> <h2>Next steps (in the next 2-3 months)</h2> <ul> <li>Cargo integration</li> <li>A dedicated, minimal website</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>I hope you enjoy using Samoyed, the beautiful cousin of Husky!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/___nutthead___"> /u/___nutthead___ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/samoyed">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nprs04/released_samoyed_020_a_singlefile_the_singlefile/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, </p> <p>A bit of context:</p> <p>we currently use an array of web services served with hyper and so far it&#39;s great. We also developed some services that act like a proxy to said backends (TLS termination, Http2 webservers, Http1 websockets for backends). Service range from API to full app with database calls. And many middlewares. Performance with hyper is fine for our load.</p> <p>I tried Pingora and ended up being kind of reluctant to use rustls (which we do with hyper) since its support is still experimental. No ktls sendfile as well.</p> <p><strong>But for some reasons</strong>, it seems easier to work with. Seems like developing middlewares for it is a no drama story. Overall more productive for the small tests I created. Hyper v1 is &quot;easy&quot; as well, but it&#39;s more verbose.</p> <p>Other than that I would like to know if there is something I could have missed that could justify to replace our current stack with Pingora. </p> <p>The question now: </p> <p>For those who switched between the two, what are your day to day experiences/comparisons? (either direction, but please no Axum stories, that&#39;s important, the code review showed that it added some clones, light and much heavier, see extractors, so it has been ruled out, and we don&#39;t need the goodies it offers on the other hand.

If you put a skill into Overdrive (costing MP) that skill does extra damage for 3 turns, but if it hits an enemies weakness it gives you an extra turn (think Persona 3s One More). There&#39;s also another one called Full Throttle, which allows you to regain a skills charges (the amount of times you can use a skill before it cooldowns) and reset the cooldown, also for MP. Any ideas? I&#39;m currently testing how it feels to go in multiple encounters-how should MP,which is probably commonly used, be replenished?

It‚Äôs a sandbox/god game where players can build and shape their own fantasy world.</p> <p>Before running ads, I had already posted about my game on Reddit, and those posts did really well thousands of upvotes and even millions of views across different subreddits. That gave me confidence to test paid ads, since I knew the audience was there.</p> <h1>The Campaigns</h1> <p><strong>EU AD</strong> :<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768/comments/1k5wjyt/build%5C_your%5C_own%5C_rpg%5C_fantasy%5C_world%5C_and%5C_watch%5C_the/?p=1">https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768/comments/1k5wjyt/build\_your\_own\_rpg\_fantasy\_world\_and\_watch\_the/?p=1</a></p> <p><strong>US AD</strong>: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768/comments/1k6tqvr/build_your_own_rpg_fantasy_world_and_watch_the/?p=1">https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768/comments/1k6tqvr/build_your_own_rpg_fantasy_world_and_watch_the/?p=1</a></p> <p><strong>April 17‚Äì23</strong></p> <ul> <li>Target: European countries</li> <li>Budget: ‚Ç¨16/day</li> <li>Total spent: ‚Ç¨93</li> <li>Wishlists: 164 (tracked)</li> <li>Cost per wishlist: ‚Ç¨0.56</li> </ul> <p><strong>April 23‚ÄìMay 14</strong></p> <ul> <li>Added U.S. campaign at same budget ‚Ç¨32/day combined</li> <li>Total spent: ‚Ç¨615</li> <li>Wishlists: 1,824 (tracked)</li> <li>Cost per wishlist: ‚Ç¨0.33</li> </ul> <p><strong>May 15‚ÄìMay 22</strong></p> <ul> <li>Budget: ‚Ç¨52/day</li> <li>Total spent: ‚Ç¨397</li> <li>Wishlists: 873</li> <li>Cost per wishlist: ‚Ç¨0.45</li> </ul> <p><strong>June 2‚Äì13</strong></p> <ul> <li>Budget: ‚Ç¨100/day</li> <li>Total spent: ~‚Ç¨1,000</li> <li>Wishlists: 1,767</li> <li>Cost per wishlist: ‚Ç¨0.56</li> </ul> <p><strong>June 14‚Äì23</strong> <em>(final test)</em></p> <ul> <li>Budget: ‚Ç¨150/day</li> <li>Total spent: ‚Ç¨1,500</li> <li>Wishlists: 2,676</li> <li>Cost per wishlist: ‚Ç¨0.56</li> <li>Steam algorithm started giving me <strong>10,000+ daily impressions</strong> organically</li> </ul> <h1>Results &amp; Insights</h1> <ul> <li>In total I tracked <strong>7,140 wishlists</strong>.

That means ~<strong>6,000+ wishlists came organically</strong>, triggered by the Steam algorithm once external traffic spiked.</li> <li>Even today, with <strong>no ads running</strong>, the game still gains <strong>10‚Äì30 wishlists per day</strong> organically.</li> <li>Beyond numbers: I also gained <strong>community members, Discord users, playtesters, and feedback</strong> things no metric can fully capture.</li> </ul> <h1>Lessons Learned</h1> <ul> <li>Reddit ads <strong>can be worth it</strong> for niche genres with active communities (I targeted <em>RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, WorldBox</em>).</li> <li>Ads alone don‚Äôt guarantee success - they work best when paired with the <strong>Steam algorithm</strong>. Spiking traffic in short bursts was much more effective than slow trickles.</li> <li><strong>Pricing matters</strong>. Ads only make sense if you can eventually earn the money back, so your game‚Äôs price point is a critical factor in deciding whether paid marketing is viable.</li> <li>The biggest ‚Äúwin‚Äù wasn‚Äôt just the wishlists, but the <strong>long-term visibility and community</strong> that still grows every day without additional spend.</li> </ul> <p>I know a lot of indie devs wonder whether ads are worth it, so I wanted to share these numbers transparently. Hopefully this helps you evaluate if it‚Äôs right for your game.</p> <p>Happy to answer any questions in the comments!</p> <p>video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGA9Vpfw_vc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGA9Vpfw_vc</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768"> /u/Hot-Persimmon-9768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1npmgz8/i_spent_3594_on_reddit_ads_for_my_indie_game_was/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1npmgz8/i_spent_3594_on_reddit_ads_for_my_indie_game_was/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I guess most of us started as solo developers dreaming we‚Äôd make GTA 7‚Ä¶ all by ourselves. But once you realize how brutal solo dev work is‚Ä¶ you have to be the programmer, the artist, the marketer, and, most importantly, your own financier until the project is finished, you start to understand why big studios have teams. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible to finish a game solo (otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be so many solo devs today), but it‚Äôs definitely hard.</p> <p>About a year ago I decided to take my hobby to the ‚Äúnext level‚Äù (sounds like I became a Rockstar senior now lol), so I bought Udemy courses and pushed myself to spend more time reading Unity documentation, etc. I don‚Äôt expect to make money from it (though I‚Äôd like to), but when I have a hobby I like to invest time and money into it to get better. There‚Äôs a nice feeling in having something you work on, pouring time and effort into solving a problem, and eventually getting it done. That‚Äôs literally why I program.</p> <p>I realized I couldn‚Äôt focus on everything at once, so I hired someone to draw assets while I handle the programming, and that made my life a lot easier. Since I‚Äôd been a solo dev for a long time, I was understandably skeptical about working with others, but I tried to find someone I could actually collaborate with. I ended up finding a few people on Reddit and Fiverr, and finally on Devoted by Fusion, which, out of all of them, proved to be the best fit for my needs actually, since it has a system that is looking into your needs first and then, finds an artist from the pool that matches it. I must admit it‚Äôs been a great experience experimenting and meeting different people, but the ideal outcome is when two people just click and share the same vision. In the end it‚Äôs all trial and error‚Ä¶ you have to try multiple times before you reach the right result.</p> <p>When did you realize you couldn‚Äôt do it all alone anymore, and what made you decide to hire someone to work with you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WelderNo6809"> /u/WelderNo6809 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1npaeeh/when_did_you_stop_being_a_true_solo_dev/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1npaeeh/when_did_you_stop_being_a_true_solo_dev/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is not a DNS block, otherwise my game wouldn&#39;t be affected, it&#39;s an IP block.</p> <p>When there&#39;s a football match on (I&#39;m told) they randomly ban cloudflare IP ranges.</p> <p>Indeed every single time I&#39;ve seen the server go down from my telegram notifications I&#39;ve jumped on discord and asked my friends, who watch football, if there&#39;s a match on.
