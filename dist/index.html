For example, if someone asked me what a middleware is, I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to explain it properly.</p> <p>Today, I wanted to implement some form of authentication for one of my side projects. I knew I needed to use something like JWT, so I started searching online for resources to understand the theory behind authentication‚Äîwhat it is, what sessions are, how state is stored, what cookies are, etc. But I found the vast number of resources overwhelming. Most are stack specific and not very general, which made it hard to piece everything together.</p> <p>So, what resources do you recommend for learning these concepts? Are there any beginner friendly materials you&#39;d suggest?</p> <p>Thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/randombro420"> /u/randombro420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m7suj7/what_blogsarticles_would_you_guys_recommend_to_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m7suj7/what_blogsarticles_would_you_guys_recommend_to_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I built <code>prof</code> to automate the tedious parts of working with <code>pprof</code>, especially when it comes to inspecting individual functions. Instead of doing something like this:</p> <p>```bash</p> <h1>Run benchmark</h1> <p>go test -bench=BenchmarkName -cpuprofile=cpu.out -memprofile=memory.out ...</p> <h1>Generate reports for each profile type</h1> <p>go tool pprof -cum -top cpu.out go tool pprof -cum -top memory.out</p> <h1>Extract function-level data for each function of interest</h1> <p>go tool pprof -list=Function1 cpu.out &gt; function1.txt go tool pprof -list=Function2 cpu.out &gt; function2.txt</p> <h1>... repeat for every function √ó every profile type</h1> <p>```</p> <p>You just run one command:</p> <p><code>bash prof --benchmarks &quot;[BenchmarkMyFunction]&quot; --profiles &quot;[cpu,memory]&quot; --count 5 --tag &quot;v1.0&quot; </code></p> <p><code>prof</code> collects all the data from the previous commands, organizes it, and makes it searchable in your workspace. So instead of running commands back and forth, you can just search by function or benchmark name. The structured output makes it much easier to track your progress during long optimization sessions.</p> <p>Furthermore, I implemented performance comparison at the profile level, example:</p> <p>``` Performance Tracking Summary</p> <p>Functions Analyzed: 78 Regressions: 9 Improvements: 9 Stable: 60</p> <p>Top Regressions (worst first)</p> <p>These functions showed the most significant slowdowns between benchmark runs:</p> <p><code>runtime.lockInternal</code>: <strong>+200%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.030s) <code>example.com/mypkg/pool.Put</code>: <strong>+200%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.030s) <code>runtime.madvise</code>: <strong>+100%</strong> (0.050s ‚Üí 0.100s) <code>runtime.gcDrain</code>: <strong>+100%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.020s) <code>runtime.nanotimeInternal</code>: <strong>+100%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.020s) <code>runtime.schedule</code>: <strong>+66.7%</strong> (0.030s ‚Üí 0.050s) <code>runtime.growStack</code>: <strong>+50.0%</strong> (0.020s ‚Üí 0.030s) <code>runtime.sleepMicro</code>: <strong>+25.0%</strong> (0.280s ‚Üí 0.350s) <code>runtime.asyncPreempt</code>: <strong>+8.2%</strong> (4.410s ‚Üí 4.770s)</p> <p>Top Improvements (best first)</p> <p>These functions saw the biggest performance gains:</p> <p><code>runtime.allocObject</code>: <strong>-100%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.000s) <code>runtime.markScan</code>: <strong>-100%</strong> (0.010s ‚Üí 0.000s) <code>sync/atomic.CompareAndSwapPtr</code>: <strong>-80.0%</strong> (0.050s ‚Üí 0.010s) <code>runtime.signalThreadKill</code>: <strong>-60.0%</strong> (0.050s ‚Üí 0.020s) <code>runtime.signalCondWake</code>: <strong>-44.4%</strong> (0.090s ‚Üí 0.050s) <code>runtime.runQueuePop</code>: <strong>-33.3%</strong> (0.030s ‚Üí 0.020s) <code>runtime.waitOnCond</code>: <strong>-28.6%</strong> (0.210s ‚Üí 0.150s) <code>testing.(*B).RunParallel.func1</code>: <strong>-25.0%</strong> (0.040s ‚Üí 0.030s) <code>example.com/mypkg/cpuIntensiveTask</code>: <strong>-4.5%</strong> (74.050s ‚Üí 70.750s) ```</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof">https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/prof</a></p> <p>All feedback is appreciated and welcomed!</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> I built this initially as a python script to play around with python and because I needed something like this.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I&#39;ve been working in Rust for a couple of years and I need some help trying to re-implement my Rust code in other (specifically OOP languages.)</p> <p>I&#39;d like to learn a bit more about other languages, like C#, Java, Golang and some others. Mostly out of curiosity and just to learn some new stuff. Thing is, I&#39;ve been working so much in Rust, that I can no longer really &quot;think&quot; in other languages. I&#39;ve become sort of addicted to the way Rust does things, and most of the stuff I write I&#39;m absolutely unable to implement in other languages.</p> <p>To be more specific, here is an example. One of my recent projects is a weather station with a server and a couple of ESP32S3 MCUs with a temperature/humidity sensor. I wrote a custom messaging protocol, since I didn&#39;t really like the way MQTT was implemented in ESP-IDF, and I wanted to dive deeper into socket/TCP programming.</p> <p>My solution is pretty simple: messages that can either be a <code>Request</code> or a <code>Response</code>. Both of them are enums, and they represent different request/response types.</p> <pre><code>enum Message { Request(request::Request), Response(response::Response), } pub enum Request { Ping, PostResults { temperature: f32, humidity: u8, air_pressure: Option&lt;u16&gt;, // not supported by every sensor /* ... */ }, /* ... */ } pub enum Response { Pong, Ok, Error(String), /* ... */ } </code></pre> <p>Rust makes it incredibly easy to represent this data structure, though in (for example) C#, I have absolutely no idea how I could represent this.</p> <p>Copilot gave me following solution, but I personally don&#39;t really like to rely on AI, so I don&#39;t know if this approach is good or bad, but to me, it just looks a bit too complicated.</p> <pre><code>using System; namespace PwmProtocol { // Abstract base type for all requests public abstract class Request { // Add common properties/methods if needed } public sealed class Ping : Request { } public sealed class PostResults : Request { public Temperature Temperature { get; } public Humidity Humidity { get; } public AirPressure? AirPressure { get; } public PostResults(Temperature temperature, Humidity humidity, AirPressure? airPressure = null) =&gt; (Temperature, Humidity, AirPressure) = (temperature, humidity, airPressure); } /* ... */ } </code></pre> <p>One other solution that comes to mind is to create a <code>Message</code> class, give it a <code>kind</code> and <code>data</code> attribute. The <code>kind</code> would store the message type (request/response + exact type of request/response) and the <code>data</code> would simply be a hashmap with something like <code>temperature</code>, <code>humidity</code>, etc. One disadvantage I can immediately think of, is that <code>data</code> would not have a strict structure nor strictly defined data types. All of that would have to be checked at runtime.</p> <p>What do you think? Is there a better solution to this in languages other than Rust? For now, I&#39;m specifically interested in C# (no particular reason). But I&#39;m curious about other languages too, like Java and Golang.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/br0kenpixel_"> /u/br0kenpixel_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m7gesc/understanding_other_ways_to_implement_rust_enums/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m7gesc/understanding_other_ways_to_implement_rust_enums/">[comments]</a></span></div>
