            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Kind regards,</strong></p> <p>I‚Äôm seeking advice particularly on how to approach situations like the one I‚Äôm currently facing. I graduated from university, but unfortunately, the education system in my country and especially the university I attended was heavily theory-oriented. About 90% of the curriculum relied on documents and PDFs, while the remaining 10% was left entirely up to us, the students, to figure things out on our own.</p> <p>Throughout all the years of my degree, perhaps one professor spent 15 minutes explaining actual code. After that, we never again had a meaningful discussion about practical programming in class. I didn‚Äôt swim against the current; instead, I allowed myself to get caught in that methodology. I was satisfied just turning in assignments and moving on, without breaking out of that cycle or fostering a genuine curiosity to learn. The little programming I did amounted to some personal websites that were, frankly, terrible.</p> <p>Today, I deeply regret the way I handled that situation. For the first time in my life, I feel genuinely mediocre and I say that with total honesty.</p> <p>I&#39;ve jumped from one language to another, constantly shifting direction. I let trends push me into chasing the latest &quot;fresh out of the microwave&quot; technologies, often without purpose. I confined myself to the belief that if I didn‚Äôt learn web development, I‚Äôd starve. I received advice from more experienced peers, but their perspectives were naturally shaped by the comfort and stability of their current positions.</p> <p>Looking back made me hit the wall a few times to wake me up, I finally stopped and took a hard look at myself. I decided to stop drowning in self-pity and start over this time with the mindset of an adult, committed to whatever path I choose, whether it&#39;s the right one or not. No regrets.</p> <p>I‚Äôve chosen <strong>Rust</strong> as that new starting point. <em>‚ÄúStart, and don‚Äôt look back.‚Äù</em></p> <p>I hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as overly dramatic, emotional, or immature. I just genuinely want to hear from those who‚Äôve faced similar struggles. How did you get through them? Was Rust a part of your journey?</p> <h1>And I‚Äôd also like to ask:</h1> <ul> <li>What kinds of Rust projects would help me build solid programming thinking, beyond just visual or surface-level development?</li> <li>What kinds of exercises or projects did you start with in Rust that helped you break free from the mindset of learning only for the sake of school assignments?</li> <li>Do you believe that focusing on Rust can help cultivate a more mature, responsible mindset, centered on writing high-quality code even from the very beginning?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks in advance to whoever take the time to leave a comment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Specialist_Effect179"> /u/Specialist_Effect179 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxx948/webpages_are_not_the_totality_of_programming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxx948/webpages_are_not_the_totality_of_programming/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I don&#39;t know where would be the best place to post this, but I wanted some people&#39;s feedback on a DSL that I wrote for network analysis.</p> <p>I am using nom for writing the lexer and parser, then using abi_stable crate for data types so that you can write plugins to the language and load them dynamically as well.</p> <p>This language is made to work by loading a tree graph (network) and then call a bunch of node or network functions that work on it. There are different ways you can run functions, and use node/network attributes.</p> <p>I am mostly self-taught, so it took a lot of years to get to a level where I could write something like this. I am learning a lot and having a lot of fun in the process, but I want this to develop into something that can have a practical usefulness to people. Since I am in the field of hydrology, I am making it with river networks in the mind. </p> <p>To try it out, you can either download the executables for windows from the releases page, or you can compile it using cargo (for all OS; except android where GUI won&#39;t work, CLI will work in termux). I have some basic examples in the <a href="https://nadi-system.github.io/learn-examples.html">Learn By Examples section of the User Guide</a> that you can follow.</p> <ul> <li>The repo is at: <a href="https://github.com/Nadi-System/nadi-system">https://github.com/Nadi-System/nadi-system</a></li> <li>And the User Guide is at: <a href="https://nadi-system.github.io/">https://nadi-system.github.io/</a> (although the guide also talks about other parts of the system, you can ignore them for this post)</li> </ul> <p>Please let me know if you can&#39;t compile/use it as well. I have tried to make sure it has required instructions, but I could have missed something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InfamouslyFamousMe"> /u/InfamouslyFamousMe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxtsmu/requesting_feedback_on_a_domain_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxtsmu/requesting_feedback_on_a_domain_specific/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Linkml is a data modeling language that turns a datamodel (in yaml) into various format, going from python (pydantic, dataclasses), linked data (ttl, json-ld), java, ‚Ä¶</p> <p>Basically, the task is to generate rust structs for all the classes defined in the linkml datamodel.</p> <p>I found the task to be challenging, my rust experience is limited and there are some difficult nuts to crack:</p> <ul> <li>Modeling inheritance (obviously), mixins and polymorphism.</li> <li>Modeling links between structs: owned values, boxed values, trait objects, ..</li> <li>Bindings (python, wasm) and (de)serialisation.</li> </ul> <p>Our strategy so far:</p> <ul> <li>We generate a struct for every class.</li> <li>Subclasses: we create structs and repeat all ‚Äúsuperclass‚Äù attributes (eg Car struct repeats all Vehicle attributes). In addition to this we create a ‚ÄúCarOrSubtype‚Äù like enum for every class having subclasses.</li> <li>Links: we use owned by default, reverting to Box when using an owned attribute would result in an infinite size struct.</li> <li>Polymorphism: we create a trait with getters for every struct, and trait implementations for the structs and its subclasses, and also for the ‚Äúclass or subclass enum‚Äù. We don‚Äôt do setters in the trait (but the struct attributes are pub).</li> </ul> <p>As an example, <a href="https://github.com/Kapernikov/rust-linkml-core/blob/new-rustgen/src/metamodel/src/lib.rs#L511">here</a> is the linkml metamodel in rust for a class with a deep hierarchy.</p> <p>Polymorphism support for this class is in a separate module, <a href="https://github.com/Kapernikov/rust-linkml-core/blob/new-rustgen/src/metamodel/src/poly.rs#L82">here</a></p> <p>This opens different options for working with subclasses</p> <ul> <li>you can use the enums in a match</li> <li>you can use trait implementations for the objects or trait objects (but in our data model, none of the attributes are trait objects), or the trait impl that sits on the enum directly</li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôm unsure about some decisions:</p> <ul> <li>Boxes (and vecs/hashmaps of boxes) cause a lot of trouble due to the orphan rule, when trying to give all getters (on trait) an uniform signature whether the underlying algorithm is boxed or not.</li> <li>Owned values in the struct cause a lot of trouble (eg now we can have Vec&lt;Box&lt;CarOrSubtype&gt;&gt;) and could have inflated size for deep class hierarchies, but the alternative (trait objects) is also not ideal.</li> <li>The box+orphan rule causes problems for pyo3 (rather than exposing structs with pyclass directly I have to generate lots of IntoPyObject impls). Newtype pattern would solve this but i‚Äôm hesitant to introduce a custom Box type in an API. I wonder if there is a better way.</li> <li>I now have lots of generated repeated code. Some macros could reduce this in a big way. But i think there is no point in using macros as all repeated code is generated anyway.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kervel"> /u/kervel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxifpq/creating_a_rust_generator_for_linkml/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxifpq/creating_a_rust_generator_for_linkml/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The runtime tries to be as easy to use and performant as possible, and focus mainly for web servers. Its aim is to be a single binary that you can drop anywhere to run your servers, with the speed and safety of Rust, but without having the complexity and build times. Almost all of the components is written in Rust using different popular crates.</p> <p>Example usage:</p> <p>```lua -- Create a new server local server = Astra.http.server:new()</p> <p>-- Register a route server:get(&quot;/&quot;, function() return &quot;hello from default Astra instance!&quot; end)</p> <p>-- Configure the server server.port = 3000</p> <p>-- Run the server server:run() ```</p> <p>The runtime currently features HTTP1/2 server (axum), client (reqwest), SQL driver (sqlx), async tasks (tokio), crypto (sha2, sha3, base64), JSON (serde_json), cookies (tower), and many other smaller but useful things such as pretty printing, data validation, ...</p> <p>In the v0.20 release, there has been a huge refactor in the code structure and API design, making it finally somewhat usable outside. There has also been some production testing internally at ArkForge and some other users in startups, although I would not personally recommend full production use of it as its quite young.</p> <p>I am the main developer of it as well, feel free to AMA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ElhamAryanpur"> /u/ElhamAryanpur </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxhmhr/astra_v020_released_a_lua_5154jitluau_runtime/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kxhmhr/astra_v020_released_a_lua_5154jitluau_runtime/">[comments]</a></span></div>

App was originally intended for content creators, educators and for document processing pipelines.</p> <p>As someone working in EdTech, I‚Äôve often needed to extract specific pages from large PDF documents for creating educational content like preparing course materials, sharing visuals or assembling new resources. Managing this manually was tedious, especially when dealing with high volumes.</p> <p>I also work with AI pipelines using n8n where AI processes images and extracts different features like text or pictures. So I thought that having a CLI tool that can help automate page extraction from PDFs would be useful - and that&#39;s how this project was born.</p> <p>Key features:</p> <p>‚úÖ Extract specific pages or ranges (example: 2, 5, 10-15, 20)</p> <p>‚úÖ Choose output image format</p> <p>‚úÖ Scale images or set specific image size</p> <p>‚úÖ Generate thumbnails</p> <p>‚úÖ Asynchronous processing using goroutines for speed</p> <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/dmikhr/pdfjuicer">https://github.com/dmikhr/pdfjuicer</a></p> <p>Would appreciate your feedback!

The original architecture decision was to <em>not</em> pass <code>context.Context</code> down the call stack from the handler. As a result, we have hundreds of methods with signatures like <code>DoSomething(input Input) (Output, error)</code> instead of the more idiomatic <code>DoSomething(ctx context.Context, input Input) (Output, error)</code>.</p> <p>This design made sense at the time, but now we‚Äôre trying to implement distributed tracing‚Äîand without access to <code>ctx</code>, we can‚Äôt propagate trace spans or carry request-scoped data through the application layers.</p> <p><strong>My questions:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Has anyone dealt with a similar legacy Go codebase that lacks context propagation?</li> <li>Is refactoring all method signatures to include <code>ctx</code> realistically the only long-term solution?</li> <li>Are there any community-backed patterns or practical workarounds for introducing tracing <em>without</em> breaking every interface?</li> <li>If you‚Äôve done a large-scale <code>ctx</code> refactor, any tips for managing that safely and incrementally?</li> </ul> <p>Would love to hear how others have approached this.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey y&#39;all.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been unemployed for six months and feel like I&#39;m getting nowhere applying to jobs. With ~150 applications, I&#39;ve gotten two first interviews. Both went well, and led to follow-ups, but they chose someone else in the end.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working in game dev and VR as a software engineer since 2017, starting out as an intern and working my way up to mid-level and lead dev roles at game and ed-tech companies. I left my last role about six months ago due to a really toxic work environment, expecting to find another job in a couple months. In retrospect, I wish I&#39;d taken my time with that exit and lined up another job first, but can&#39;t change the past.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the background I&#39;m working with:</p> <ul> <li>7-8 years of experience working in Unity &amp; C#</li> <li>3 years of experience with AR/VR development</li> <li>5 years of experience targeting Android and iOS platforms</li> <li>3 years of release engineering / build automation experience with Jenkins/TeamCity</li> <li>3 semesters of college toward a Comp Sci BS (degree is incomplete)</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;ve worked on a variety of different projects, and have top-notch programming skills. I&#39;m also unfortunately limited to remote roles or roles in south-western PA, since relocation is not currently in the cards.</p> <p>What would you do in this position? I know the job market is really tough currently... Is it worth trying to branch out and learn Unreal Engine? Will that make me any more likely to land interviews/jobs? Or should I look into roles &amp; tech stacks outside of the game dev industry?</p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I wanted to share my experience learning game development, specifically with Godot over the past 1.5 years, culminating in my first Steam release next week. As a newbie, I was always curious about how others started their journeys and how long things took, so I hope this is of interest to someone out there!</p> <h1>Background</h1> <p>My professional background is in data analytics (about 5 years&#39; experience), mainly using Python and building data visualizations. At the start of 2024, I had some downtime at work and wanted to improve my object-oriented programming. Gaming‚Äôs always been a big part of my life, so I thought why not try making one?</p> <p>I first tinkered with some moving punches and monkey JPEGs in Pygame, but quickly realized I wanted a proper engine. I decided on Godot, since I read that GDScript was close to Python and the engine itself was lightweight and easy to pick up. So I began learning in the evenings while juggling a full-time job.</p> <h1>Tutorials</h1> <p>In the first month, I dove into two YouTube tutorials:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAh_Kx5Zh5Q">ClearCode‚Äôs 15-hour Godot Crash Course</a> - I still recommended this regularly to this day! Super beginner-friendly and covered everything from animations to raycasts. I ended the course with a basic top-down shooter and I had a lot of fun adding my own flavour to the code like enemies and sounds. This helped a lot in applying what I‚Äôd learned.</li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_HRW-NzBg4&amp;list=PLMb6Yv6-w-RWngEjn_YeMzVwgyXBZ73Bf">GameDevKnight‚Äôs 2D Platformer Tutorial</a> - A nice supplement, though not as comprehensive or beignner friendly as ClearCode‚Äôs.</li> </ul> <h1>The 20 Games Challenge</h1> <p>After this first month, I‚Äôd fully caught the gamedev bug. My YouTube feed was all tutorials and devlogs, and on Reddit I regularly lurk in <a href="/r/gamedev">r/gamedev</a> and <a href="/r/godot">r/godot</a>.</p> <p>Tutorial hell was a term I learnt about early on, and I was interested to see if I was stuck in it. I came across the 20 Games Challenge, which seemed like the next logical step. For my next few projects, I (re)made:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://sleepyrocket.itch.io/pong">Pong</a> (~3 days)</li> <li><a href="https://sleepyrocket.itch.io/wizard-runner">A wizard-themed endless runner</a> (~1 week)</li> <li><a href="https://sleepyrocket.itch.io/asteroids-2005">An Asteroids clone</a> (~1 week)</li> <li>Pac-Man (~2 weeks - this one almost broke me trying to replicate grid-based movement)</li> </ul> <p>At this point I was no longer following tutorials, just Googling bugs, and that felt like real progress. Feeling more confident, I wanted to explore Custom Resources (I read that it is Godot‚Äôs version of Unity&#39;s ScriptableObjects). I made:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://sleepyrocket.itch.io/knight-in-the-dungeon">A simple roguelike</a> (~1 month)</li> <li>A one screen fishing game</li> </ul> <p>This was also when I truly realized that ‚Äúthe last 10% is 90% of the work.‚Äù But at this point, I felt I could tackle most 2D ideas I had (though I‚Äôd learn the hard way about overscoping later).</p> <h1>My First Game Jam</h1> <p>6 months in, I started looking out for game jams and eventually joined the Pixel Art Game Jam. I teamed up with my partner, who‚Äôd never done digital art but she was pretty decent at pencil drawing.</p> <p>Over 10 days, we built a <a href="https://sleepyrocket.itch.io/bathhouse-creatures-jam">small management game</a> about running hot baths for animal customers in a Japanese-style bathhouse.</p> <p>To our surprise, we were selected as one of the five winners! The response was positive and we decided that it would be pretty cool to learn how to publish a commercial game on Steam‚Ä¶</p> <h1>First Steam Game</h1> <p>The following year was a rollercoaster ride in learning everything beyond development:</p> <ul> <li>Rewriting jam code (still messy, but less so!)</li> <li>Scoping down ideas to something finishable (we were excited and had grand ideas but most of them never came to fruition)</li> <li>marketing (or lack thereof), social media, optimizing our Steam page, participating in festivals and everything in between</li> </ul> <p>There were moments when it started to feel more like a small business than a hobby, but we kept reminding ourselves that it started as a learning journey. We would have been happy if 1 person would play our game.</p> <p>After ~8 months of being on Steam, our game is sitting at ~1,600 wishlists. Participating in Steam Next Fest this February was a wild ride, watching streamers play our demo while wishlists pretty much tripled was a total dopamine hit. I understand now why developers chase wishlists.</p> <p>You can check out the game here: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209920/Bathhouse_Creatures/">Bathhouse Creatures on Steam</a></p> <h1>Next Steps</h1> <p>It‚Äôs been a long journey, but I‚Äôm still excited to keep going. First, I‚Äôll launch the game, fix the bugs, and play some Clair Obscur. Then maybe I‚Äôll work on another small Steam game‚Ä¶ or dive into 3D and Blender donuts, I&#39;m not sure yet.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p> <ul> <li>Started learning Godot in early 2024 (with ~5 years&#39; Python/data background)</li> <li>Completed ClearCode‚Äôs crash course (10/10 would recommend!)</li> <li>Did the 20 Games Challenge (great way to learn!) and recreated games like Pong and Pacman.</li> <li>Joined a game jam with my partner</li> <li>Spent the next year turning our jam game into a Steam release</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sleepy-rocket"> /u/sleepy-rocket </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kxixbn/my_15_year_learning_journey_from_tutorials_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kxixbn/my_15_year_learning_journey_from_tutorials_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I launched my first indie game on steam almost 2 years ago and I would consider it as a success for my first game as I sold 3245 copies as of now I know its not that much but I am happy with it. Someone emailed me that he and hes team wanted to buy the game and turn it into NFT now I have no experience or any related knowledge in the web3 world but he offered to pay me 70 percent of my total revenue (not gross revenue) and I am tempted to sell it as the game as of now only sells 3-5 copies per month and its basically dead. Earning additional money from this doesn&#39;t sound so bad</p> <p>So I know it sounds really sketchy and I have my doubts as well but the thing is he offered to Pay me first before any transaction or sending him source code. Through Wise and we agreed on 70% of total sum should be the initial payment and I transfer him the game and he sends me the remaining 30 percent </p> <p>Any devs has experienced this before? what are your thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Japqqq"> /u/Japqqq </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kxa5vh/someone_offered_to_buy_of_my_old_game_on_steam/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kxa5vh/someone_offered_to_buy_of_my_old_game_on_steam/">[comments]</a></span></div>
