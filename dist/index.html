<p>Go 1.25 includes new container-aware <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> defaults, providing more sensible default behavior for many container workloads, avoiding throttling that can impact tail latency, and improving Go&rsquo;s out-of-the-box production-readiness.
In this post, we will dive into how Go schedules goroutines, how that scheduling interacts with container-level CPU controls, and how Go can perform better with awareness of container CPU controls.</p>
<h2 id="gomaxprocs"><code>GOMAXPROCS</code></h2>
<p>One of Go&rsquo;s strengths is its built-in and easy-to-use concurrency via goroutines.
From a semantic perspective, goroutines appear very similar to operating system threads, enabling us to write simple, blocking code.
On the other hand, goroutines are more lightweight than operating system threads, making it much cheaper to create and destroy them on the fly.</p>
<p>While a Go implementation could map each goroutine to a dedicated operating system thread, Go keeps goroutines lightweight with a runtime scheduler that makes threads fungible.
Any Go-managed thread can run any goroutine, so creating a new goroutine doesn&rsquo;t require creating a new thread, and waking a goroutine doesn&rsquo;t necessarily require waking another thread.</p>
<p>That said, along with a scheduler comes scheduling questions.
For example, exactly how many threads should we use to run goroutines?
If 1,000 goroutines are runnable, should we schedule them on 1,000 different threads?</p>
<p>This is where <a href="/pkg/runtime#GOMAXPROCS"><code>GOMAXPROCS</code></a> comes in.
Semantically, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> tells the Go runtime the &ldquo;available parallelism&rdquo; that Go should use.
In more concrete terms, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> is the maximum number of threads to use for running goroutines at once.</p>
<p>So, if <code>GOMAXPROCS=8</code> and there are 1,000 runnable goroutines, Go will use 8 threads to run 8 goroutines at a time.
Often, goroutines run for a very short time and then block, at which point Go will switch to running another goroutine on that same thread.
Go will also preempt goroutines that don&rsquo;t block on their own, ensuring all goroutines get a chance to run.</p>
<p>From Go 1.5 through Go 1.24, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> defaulted to the total number of CPU cores on the machine.
Note that in this post, &ldquo;core&rdquo; more precisely means &ldquo;logical CPU.&rdquo;
For example, a machine with 4 physical CPUs with hyperthreading has 8 logical CPUs.</p>
<p>This typically makes a good default for &ldquo;available parallelism&rdquo; because it naturally matches the available parallelism of the hardware.
That is, if there are 8 cores and Go runs more than 8 threads at a time, the operating system will have to multiplex these threads onto the 8 cores, much like how Go multiplexes goroutines onto threads.
This extra layer of scheduling is not always a problem, but it is unnecessary overhead.</p>
<h2 id="container-orchestration">Container Orchestration</h2>
<p>Another of Go&rsquo;s core strengths is the convenience of deploying applications via a container, and managing the number of cores Go uses is especially important when deploying an application within a container orchestration platform.
Container orchestration platforms like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> take a set of machine resources and schedule containers within the available resources based on requested resources.
Packing as many containers as possible within a cluster&rsquo;s resources requires the platform to be able to predict the resource usage of each scheduled container.
We want Go to adhere to the resource utilization constraints that the container orchestration platform sets.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s explore the effects of the <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> setting in the context of Kubernetes, as an example.
Platforms like Kubernetes provide a mechanism to limit the resources consumed by a container.
Kubernetes has the concept of CPU resource limits, which signal to the underlying operating system how many core resources a specific container or set of containers will be allocated.
Setting a CPU limit translates to the creation of a Linux <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#cpu" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">control group</a> CPU bandwidth limit.</p>
<p>Before Go 1.25, Go was unaware of CPU limits set by orchestration platforms.
Instead, it would set <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> to the number of cores on the machine it was deployed to.
If there was a CPU limit in place, the application may try to use far more CPU than allowed by the limit.
To prevent an application from exceeding its limit, the Linux kernel will <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#how-pods-with-resource-limits-are-run" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">throttle</a> the application.</p>
<p>Throttling is a blunt mechanism for restricting containers that would otherwise exceed their CPU limit: it completely pauses application execution for the remainder of the throttling period.
The throttling period is typically 100ms, so throttling can cause substantial tail latency impact compared to the softer scheduling multiplexing effects of a lower <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> setting.
Even if the application never has much parallelism, tasks performed by the Go runtime‚Äîsuch as garbage collection‚Äîcan still cause CPU spikes that trigger throttling.</p>
<h2 id="new-default">New default</h2>
<p>We want Go to provide efficient and reliable defaults when possible, so in Go 1.25, we have made <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> take into account its container environment by default.
If a Go process is running inside a container with a CPU limit, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> will default to the CPU limit if it is less than the core count.</p>
<p>Container orchestration systems may adjust container CPU limits on the fly, so Go 1.25 will also periodically check the CPU limit and adjust <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> automatically if it changes.</p>
<p>Both of these defaults only apply if <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> is otherwise unspecified.
Setting the <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> environment variable or calling <code>runtime.GOMAXPROCS</code> continues to behave as before.
The <a href="/pkg/runtime#GOMAXPROCS"><code>runtime.GOMAXPROCS</code></a> documentation covers the details of the new behavior.</p>
<h2 id="slightly-different-models">Slightly different models</h2>
<p>Both <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> and a container CPU limit place a limit on the maximum amount of CPU the process can use, but their models are subtly different.</p>
<p><code>GOMAXPROCS</code> is a parallelism limit.
If <code>GOMAXPROCS=8</code> Go will never run more than 8 goroutines at a time.</p>
<p>By contrast, CPU limits are a throughput limit.
That is, they limit the total CPU time used in some period of wall time.
The default period is 100ms.
So an &ldquo;8 CPU limit&rdquo; is actually a limit of 800ms of CPU time every 100ms of wall time.</p>
<p>This limit could be filled by running 8 threads continuously for the entire 100ms, which is equivalent to <code>GOMAXPROCS=8</code>.
On the other hand, the limit could also be filled by running 16 threads for 50ms each, with each thread being idle or blocked for the other 50ms.</p>
<p>In other words, a CPU limit doesn&rsquo;t limit the total number of CPUs the container can run on.
It only limits total CPU time.</p>
<p>Most applications have fairly consistent CPU usage across 100ms periods, so the new <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> default is a pretty good match to the CPU limit, and certainly better than the total core count!
However, it is worth noting that particularly spiky workloads may see a latency increase from this change due to <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> preventing short-lived spikes of additional threads beyond the CPU limit average.</p>
<p>In addition, since CPU limits are a throughput limit, they can have a fractional component (e.g., 2.5 CPU).
On the other hand, <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> must be a positive integer.
Thus, Go must round the limit to a valid <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> value.
Go always rounds up to enable use of the full CPU limit.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-requests">CPU Requests</h2>
<p>Go&rsquo;s new <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> default is based on the container&rsquo;s CPU limit, but container orchestration systems also provide a &ldquo;CPU request&rdquo; control.
While the CPU limit specifies the maximum CPU a container may use, the CPU request specifies the minimum CPU guaranteed to be available to the container at all times.</p>
<p>It is common to create containers with a CPU request but no CPU limit, as this allows containers to utilize machine CPU resources beyond the CPU request that would otherwise be idle due to lack of load from other containers.
Unfortunately, this means that Go cannot set <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> based on the CPU request, which would prevent utilization of additional idle resources.</p>
<p>Containers with a CPU request are still <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#how-pods-with-resource-limits-are-run" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">constrained</a> when exceeding their request if the machine is busy.
The weight-based constraint of exceeding requests is &ldquo;softer&rdquo; than the hard period-based throttling of CPU limits, but CPU spikes from high <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> can still have an adverse impact on application behavior.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-set-a-cpu-limit">Should I set a CPU limit?</h2>
<p>We have learned about the problems caused by having <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> too high, and that setting a container CPU limit allows Go to automatically set an appropriate <code>GOMAXPROCS</code>, so an obvious next step is to wonder whether all containers should set a CPU limit.</p>
<p>While that may be good advice to automatically get a reasonable <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> defaults, there are many other factors to consider when deciding whether to set a CPU limit, such as prioritizing utilization of idle resources by avoiding limits vs prioritizing predictable latency by setting limits.</p>
<p>The worst behaviors from a mismatch between <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> and effective CPU limits occur when <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> is significantly higher than the effective CPU limit.
For example, a small container receiving 2 CPUs running on a 128 core machine.
These are the cases where it is most valuable to consider setting an explicit CPU limit, or, alternatively, explicitly setting <code>GOMAXPROCS</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Go 1.25 provides more sensible default behavior for many container workloads by setting <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> based on container CPU limits.
Doing so avoids throttling that can impact tail latency, improves efficiency, and generally tries to ensure Go is production-ready out-of-the-box.
You can get the new defaults simply by setting the Go version to 1.25.0 or higher in your <code>go.mod</code>.</p>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In general there‚Äôs two common ways of saying ‚Äúif you implement this method, you‚Äôll get a bunch of other methods for free‚Äù.</p> <p>One method is to include a bunch of methods with default implementations. A particularly striking example is Iterator, which contains 76 methods (map, filter, etc), only one of which (next) is required. Read and Write are other such examples.</p> <p>Another method which seems to be popular in the async world is to define a very slim trait containing only the required methods and then define another trait (usually with the Ext suffix) that has a blanket implementation for all types that implement the main trait. Examples here include Future + FutureExt, Stream + StreamExt, AsyncRead + AsyncReadExt, Service + ServiceExt.</p> <p>I understand that the fundamental difference here is that the former allows implementers to override the default definitions (for example if you know you can eek out more performance for your particular concrete type than the default implementation). The downside of course is that consumers have less certainty about the concrete implementations of these methods.</p> <p>However I‚Äôm curious why the latter approach seems to be so ubiquitous in Async-land. Is the flexibility less desirable/is the consistency more desirable? Is it a function of the STL needing to be less opinionated, than these third party creates? Or is it something else?</p> <p>More broadly I‚Äôm curious about the factors that go into choosing one design or the other.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m building a GPU compiler for automatically generating fast GPU kernels for AI models in Rust. It uses search-based compilation to achieve high performance. <a href="https://github.com/luminal-ai/luminal">https://github.com/luminal-ai/luminal</a></p> <p>It takes high level model code, like you&#39;d have in PyTorch, and generate very fast GPU code. We do that without using LLMs or AI - rather, we pose it as a search problem. Our compiler builds a search space, generates millions of possible kernels, and then searches through it to minimize runtime.</p> <p>You can try out a demo in `demos/matmul` on mac to see how Luminal takes a naive operation, represented in our IR of 12 simple operations, and compiles it to an optimized, tensor-core enabled Metal kernel. Here‚Äôs a video showing how: <a href="https://youtu.be/P2oNR8zxSAA">https://youtu.be/P2oNR8zxSAA</a></p> <p>Our approach differs significantly from traditional ML libraries in that we ahead-of-time compile everything, generate a large search space of logically-equivalent kernels, and search through it to find the fastest kernels. This allows us to leverage the Bitter Lesson to discover complex optimizations like Flash Attention entirely automatically without needing manual heuristics. The best rule is no rule, the best heuristic is no heuristic, just search everything.</p> <p>We‚Äôre working on bringing CUDA support up to parity with Metal, adding more flexibility to the search space, adding full-model examples (like Llama), and adding very exotic hardware backends.</p> <p>The aim is to radically simplify the ML ecosystem while improving performance and hardware utilization. The entire library is statically compiled into a single Rust binary.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;ve been working on a text editor (<a href="https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat">link here</a>) for an embarrassingly long amount of time. It is written <em>and configured</em> in Rust. Here&#39;s a configuration example:</p> <pre><code>setup_duat!(setup); use duat::prelude::*; fn setup() { plug!( treesitter::TreeSitter, match_pairs::MatchPairs::new(), kak::Kak::new() ); map::&lt;kak::Insert&gt;(&quot;jk&quot;, &quot;&lt;Esc&gt;&quot;); print::wrap_on_edge(); // Modify every LineNumbers hook::add::&lt;LineNumbers&lt;Ui&gt;&gt;(|_, (cfg, _)| { cfg.align_right().align_main_left() }); hook::add::&lt;StatusLine&lt;Ui&gt;&gt;(|pa, (cfg, _)| { cfg.fmt(status!( &quot;{name_txt}{Spacer}{}[sep]|{sels_txt}[sep]|{main_txt}&quot;, mode_txt(pa) )) }); form::set(&quot;sep&quot;, Form::with(&quot;#506090&quot;)); } </code></pre> <p>This file does quite a lot of things: It adds three plugins, maps <code>jk</code> to <code>Esc</code>, changes wrapping, realigns <code>LineNumbers</code>, changes the <code>StatusLine</code> and sets a custom <code>Form</code>.</p> <p>There are various benefits to using Rust as a config language:</p> <ul> <li>Cargo is the plugin manager, and <a href="http://crates.io"><code>crates.io</code></a> is the plugin repository;</li> <li>Traits can act like a &quot;guide&quot; on how to extend functionality;</li> <li>People can have a fun excuse to finally learn Rust;</li> </ul> <p>I have also worked really hard to reduce many of the known drawbacks:</p> <ul> <li>Hot reloading: This problem was solved by following advice from a <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/so-you-want-to-live-reload-rust">fasterthanlime post about it</a>;</li> <li>Compile times: Duat reloads in ~2s give or take, but my computer is a fairly old model;</li> <li>Boilerplate: Due to Rust&#39;s expressiveness, code can often end up shorter than on &quot;simpler languages&quot;;</li> </ul> <p>At the moment, there are some big parts missing (floating widgets, LSP...). Even still, Duat is already incredibly extensible. Here&#39;s a short list of some of the things that can be done:</p> <ul> <li>Custom widgets through the <code>Widget</code> trait;</li> <li><code>Mode</code>s that control the <code>Widget</code>s and can replicate any multi-cursor text editor&#39;s behavior;</li> <li>A convenient <code>Text</code> struct, supporting styles, alignment, spacers, concealment and &quot;ghost text&quot;, all with the same <code>Tag</code> API.</li> <li>A really easy to use <code>StatusLine</code>, which can be modded and updated arbitrarily;</li> <li>Custom hooks with the <code>Hookable</code> trait;</li> </ul> <p>Duat is thoroughly documented, and I am currently working on an <a href="https://ahoyiski.github.io/duat"><code>mdBook</code> guide</a> to gently introduce people to the API. Although at the moment that&#39;s still nowhere near complete.</p> <p>So yeah, the question in the title. What are your thoughts on this project? Is there any interest in this sort of thing?

I am rather new to Go and I&#39;m thoroughly Java-brained, so please bare with me.</p> <p>I&#39;m aware that Go doesn&#39;t have enums, but that something similar can be achieved using types, const, and iota.</p> <p>After using this approach, I&#39;m left mildly frustrated when referencing imported enums. This isn&#39;t an issue if only a single enum is declared within a package, but becomes a bit muddy if there are multiple (or numerous other unrelated constants).</p> <p>E.g. if I had the package <code>enum</code> containing Format and ColorModel:</p> <pre><code>package enum type Format int const ( PNG Format = iota JPG WEBP ) type ColorModel int const ( GRAYSCALE ColorModel = iota RGB RGBA ARGB CMYK ) </code></pre> <p>After importing <code>enum</code> elsewhere, referencing values from either set of values doesn&#39;t provide any clear differentiation:</p> <pre><code>enum.PNG enum.GRAYSCALE </code></pre> <p>I&#39;m wondering if there is a way to have the above instead be replaced with:</p> <pre><code>Format.PNG ColorModel.GRAYSCALE </code></pre> <p>I&#39;m aware that creating a dedicated package per enum would work, but the constraint of one package per directory makes that pretty damn unappealing.</p> <p>Ordinarily, I&#39;d just stomach the imperfect solutions and crack on. At the moment, though, I&#39;m working with a lot of data sourced from a Java project, and enums are <em>everywhere</em>. Something at least resembling enums feels like a must.</p> <p>If any of you happen to know of a solution in line with what I&#39;m looking for, I&#39;d appreciate the insight.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Forgive my ramblings as I try to put into words an issue I have been experiencing in Rust gamedev for a while and only now I feel like I understand it enough to put it into words.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom recommends structuring your game around a main loop: input, update, render. Another rule is: don&#39;t block the UI thread. Game frameworks and engine in Rust seem to build around these best practices. A very common pattern is to define a game state object and provide an update function (often through a trait). The game loop or finer controls over the execution are generally handled by the engine and not exposed to the user.</p> <p>I have been using Rust for my game projects---mostly simple turn-based games. I have found that my preference with reguards to the architecture of these kind of games is quite different from the conventional one described above: since the game is turn-based, the game state is not supposed to change without user input, so I am fine blocking the UI and drawing multiple &quot;frames&quot; before polling for the next input. Also, the state update function does not update the state by a delta-time, but by a full turn. This means that many events can happen during a single state update and I would like to render them as they happen.</p> <p>All of those patterns require direct access to the UI/rendering primitives, which is only achievable if they are exposed through what is essentially a singleton. Think about <code>stdout</code> and how it can be accessed and used to modify the terminal from anywhere in the codebase.</p> <p>This seems to be essentially treated as an anti-pattern by the main Rust engines/frameworks, which effectively prevent its application. The closest I have found in Rust is macroquad, though it unfortunately uses async to render the screen which makes things more complicated. This is not the case for other languages though: notably, SDL seems to give direct and unrestrained access to the graphics pipeline. I think there are legitimate use-cases for this.</p> <p>So I guess my questions are:</p> <ul> <li>Am I completely wrong about game architecture and should I rethink my approach?</li> <li>Am I correct that the Rust ecosystem tends to favour &quot;ready packaged&quot; solutions that do not allow direct access to the backend?</li> <li>Are there engines/frameworks I am not familiar with that satisfy my requisites (other than the SDL Rust bindings)?</li> </ul> <p>I am sorry if all this is a bit rambly. I appreciate all the hard work behing the Rust gamedev ecosystem, though I often find myself fighting these tools rather than embracing them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/enc_cat"> /u/enc_cat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1mvnscp/gamedev_patterns_in_rust_and_how_i_learned_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1mvnscp/gamedev_patterns_in_rust_and_how_i_learned_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Daily run has long been the killer feature of my game, Gnomes. Anyway I&#39;ve hopefully just spiced it up with my first ever foray into the cursed lands of web. Presenting: <a href="https://gnomes-leaderboard.live/">https://gnomes-leaderboard.live/</a></p> <p>Anyway so its basically, serverside rendering, Rust, axum. Scraping the steam leaderboard API into a database. I guess this is what a web developers job basically is.</p> <p>Now, web infra was actually harder to set up than making the website was I would say. I designed the server as a standalone Rust executable. </p> <p>For Infra deployment I basically had to do the following steps:</p> <ul> <li><p>Acquire a domain name</p></li> <li><p>Sign up for cloudflare</p></li> <li><p>Switch to cloudflare (So I could use it for TLS)</p></li> <li><p>Get a VPS (NOT an ipv6 only one - its a dollar cheaper per month but not worth it!!!! Wasted like 4 hours on this! Debian 13)</p></li> <li><p>Set up TLS - I used acme.sh, it was very epic</p></li> <li><p>Deploy the files</p></li> <li><p>?????</p></li> <li><p>Profit</p></li> </ul> <p>For real though daily run is an awesome feature, even for a single player game it breathes a lot of life into the community. This website gives me the chance to add an overall / &#39;goats&#39; category so I&#39;m hoping it will spark up some competition.</p> <p>I know I should add some more context like what the daily consisted of from ingame... I will eventually I promise.
