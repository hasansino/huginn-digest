Does that happen the same way once it&#39;s unloaded? Afaik the original program is still running and the drops are never run. I have skimmed through the internet and found that in C++, for example, destructors are called in DLLMain, so no memory leaks there. When targeting a C dynamic library, does the same happen for Rust statics?</p> <p>How can I make sure after mutating that string buffer and thus memory being allocated for it, I can destroy it and unload the library safely?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sylbeth04"> /u/Sylbeth04 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lpj6t8/rusts_c_dynamic_libs_and_static_deallocation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lpj6t8/rusts_c_dynamic_libs_and_static_deallocation/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just about two years ago <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15c0j97/a_virtual_pet_site_written_in_rust_inspired_by/">I posted here</a> about how I was looking to get better with Rust and remembered how much I liked Neopets as a kid, so I ended up making a virtual pet site in Rust as a fun little project! Well, I&#39;ve still been working on it daily ever since then, and it&#39;s not quite so little anymore, so I thought I&#39;d provide an update here in case anyone was curious about how everything&#39;s going.</p> <p>It uses Rust on the backend and TypeScript on the frontend. The only frontend dependencies are TypeScript, Solid JS, and mutative. The backend server runs on a $5 / month monolithic server and mostly uses axum, sqlx, Postgres, strum, tokio, tungstenite, rand, and oauth2.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also really optimized the code since then. Previously, user requests would use JSON, but I&#39;ve since migrated to binary websockets. So now most requests and responses are only a few bytes each (variable length binary encoding).</p> <p>I also wrote some derive macro crates that convert Rust data types to TypeScript. So I can annotate my Rust structs / enums and it generates interface definitions in TypeScript land for them, along with functions to decode the binary into the generated interface types. So Rust is my single source of truth (as opposed to having proto files or something). Some simple encoding / decoding crates then serialize my Rust data structures into compact binary (so much faster and smaller than JSON). Most of the data sent (like item IDs, quantities, etc.) are all small positive integers, and with this encoding protocol each is only 1 byte (variable length encoding).</p> <p>So now I can write something like this:</p> <pre><code>#[derive(BinPack, FromRow, ToTS, DecodeTS)] pub struct ResponseProfile { pub person_id: PersonID, pub handle: String, pub created_at: UnixTimestamp, pub fishing_casts: i32 } </code></pre> <p>and the following TypeScript is automatically generated:</p> <pre><code>export interface ResponseProfile { person_id: PersonID; handle: string; created_at: UnixTimestamp; fishing_casts: number; } export function decodeResponseProfile(dv: MyDecoder): ResponseProfile { return { person_id: decodePersonID(dv), handle: dv.getStr(), created_at: decodeUnixTimestamp(dv), fishing_casts: dv.getInt(), }; } </code></pre> <p>Another design change was that previously I used a lot of <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> for many things in the web server (like everyone&#39;s current luck, activity feed, rate limiters, etc.) I never liked this and after a lot of thinking I finally switched towards an approach where each player is a separate actor, and channels are used to send messages to them, and they own their own state in their own tokio task. So each player actor now owns their activity feed, game states, current luck, arena battle state, etc. This has led to a much cleaner (and much more performant!) architecture and I was able to delete a ton of mutexes / rwlocks, and new features are much easier to add now.</p> <p>With these changes, I was able to be much more productive and added a ton of new locations, activities, items, etc. I added new puzzles, games, dark mode, etc. And during all of this time, the Rust server has still never crashed in the entire 3 years it&#39;s been running (compared to my old Node JS days this provides me <em>so</em> much peace of mind). The entire codebase (frontend + backend) has grown to be around 130,000 lines of code, but the code is still so simple and adding new features is still really trivial. And whenever I refactor anything, the Rust compiler tells me everything I need to change. It&#39;s so nice because I never have to worry about breaking anything because the compiler always tells me anything I need to update. If I had to do everything over again I would still choose Rust 100% because it&#39;s been nothing but a pleasure.</p> <p>But yeah, everything is still going great and it&#39;s so much fun coming up with new stuff to add all the time. Here&#39;s some screenshots and a trailer I made recently if you want to see what it looks like (also, almost every asset is an SVG since I wanted all the characters and locations to look beautiful at every browser zoom level).

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m coming from Java and Python world mostly, with some tinkering in fsharp. One thing I notice about Rust compared to those languages is everything is well designed. There seems to be well thought out design principles behind everything. Let&#39;s take Java. For reasons there are always rough edges. For example List interface has a method called add. Immutable lists are lists too and nothing prevents you from calling add method on an immutable list. Only you get a surprise exception at run time. If you take Python, the zen contradicts the language in many ways. In Fsharp you can write functional code that looks clean, but because of the unpredictable ways in which the language boxes and unboxes stuff, you often get slow code. Also some decisions taken at the beginning make it so that you end up with unfixable problems as the language evolves. Compared to all these Rust seems predictable and although the language has a lot of features, they are all coherently developed and do not contradict one another. Is it because of the creator of the language doing a good job or the committee behind the language features has a good process?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glum-Psychology-6701"> /u/Glum-Psychology-6701 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lp7562/why_does_rust_feel_so_well_designed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lp7562/why_does_rust_feel_so_well_designed/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just now, <a href="https://graphite.rs">Graphite</a> has broken into the top 100 Rust projects on GitHub by <a href="https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/stargazers">star</a> count, and it has been today&#39;s #1 <a href="https://github.com/trending?since=daily">trending repo</a> on all of GitHub regardless of language.</p> <p>It&#39;s a community-driven open source project that is a comprehensive 2D content creation tool for graphic design, digital art, and interactive real-time motion graphics. It also, refreshingly, has a high-quality UI design that is modern, intuitive, and user-friendly. The vision is to become the Blender equivalent of 2D creative tools. <a href="https://static.graphite.rs/content/index/sizzle-compilation.mp4">Here&#39;s a 1-minute video</a> showing the cool, unique, visually snazzy things that can be made with it.</p> <p>Graphite features a node-based procedural editing environment using a bespoke functional programming language, Graphene, that we have built on top of Rust itself such that it uses Rust&#39;s data types and <code>rustc</code> to transform artist-created documents into portable, standalone programs that can procedurally generate parametric artwork. Think: something spanning the gamut from Rive to ImageMagick.</p> <p>For the juicy technical deets, give the <em>Developer Voices</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUbcwUC5lxA">podcast episode</a> a listen where we were interviewed about how our Graphene engine/language lets even nontechnical artists &quot;paint with Rust&quot;, sort of like if Scratch used Rust as its foundation. We go into detail on the unique approach of turning a graphics editor into a compiled programming language where the visual editor is like an IDE for Rust code.</p> <h3>Here&#39;s the ask: help implement bidirectional type inference in our language&#39;s compiler</h3> <p>The Graphene language ‚Äî while it is built on top of Rust and uses Rust&#39;s compiler, data types, traits, and generics ‚Äî also has its own type checker. It supports generics, but is somewhat rudimentary and needs to be made more powerful, such as implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system">Hindley‚ÄìMilner</a> or similar, in order for Graphene types to work with contextual inference just like Rust types do.</p> <p>This involves the Graphene compiler internals and we <strong>only have one developer with a compilers background</strong> and he&#39;s a student with limited free time spread across all the crucial parts of the Graphite project&#39;s engineering. But we know that <a href="/r/rust">/r/rust</a> is ‚Äî well... ‚Äî naturally a place where many talented people who love building compilers and hobby language implementations hang out.</p> <p>This type system project should last a few weeks for someone with the right background‚Äî but for more than a year, working around having full type inference support has been a growing impediment that is impacting how we can keep developing ergonomic graphics tooling. For example, a graphics operation can&#39;t accept two inputs and use the type of the first to pick a compatible generic type for the second. This results in painful workarounds that confuse users. Even if it&#39;s just a short-term involvement, even temporarily expanding our team beyond 1 knowledgeable compiler developer would have an outsized impact on helping us execute our mission to bring programmatic graphics (and Rust!) into the hands of artists.</p> <p>If you can help, we will work closely with you to get you up to speed with the existing compiler code. If you&#39;re up for the fun and impactful challenge, the best way is to <a href="https://discord.graphite.rs">join our project Discord</a> and say you&#39;d like to help in our <code>#üíégraphene-language</code> channel. Or you can <a href="https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/issues/1621">comment on the GitHub issue</a>.</p> <p>Besides compilers, we also need general help, especially in areas of our bottlenecks: code quality review, and helping design API surfaces and architecture plans for upcoming systems. If you&#39;re an experienced engineer who could help with any of those for a few hours a week, or with general feature development, please also come get involved! Graphite is one of the easiest open source projects to start contributing to according to many of our community members; we really strive to make it as frictionless as possible to <a href="https://graphite.rs/volunteer/guide/">start out</a>. Feel free to drop by and leave a code review on any <a href="https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/pulls">open PRs</a> or ask what kind of task best fits your background (graphics, algorithm design, application programming, bug hunting, and of course most crucially: programming language compilers).</p> <p>Thank you! Now let&#39;s go forth and get artists secretly addicted to Rust üòÄ In no time at all, they will be writing custom Rust functions to do their own graphical operations.</p> <hr/> <p>P.S.

I used it widely due to the fact that the struct included in the package is massive and it contains many more nested structs of everything I need. I was thinking of decoupling code from 3rd party packages and also trying out dependency injection manually through interfaces and main() instantiation, but my worry is if I were to create an interface that my services can depend on, I have to create my own struct similar to the one provided by that 3rd party package just for the sake of abstraction.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShookethThySpear"> /u/ShookethThySpear </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lpirr4/how_loosely_coupled_should_i_make_my_code/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lpirr4/how_loosely_coupled_should_i_make_my_code/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Building the app was a breeze once I got used to the go sytanx and it&#39;s been fun.</p> <p>After completing the app I decided to make a docker container for it, So it can run anywhere without hassle. Now the problem starts. I made a container as folows:</p> <pre><code>FROM golang:1.24.4 WORKDIR /app COPY go.mod go.sum ./ RUN go mod download COPY . . # Install tools RUN curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64 &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tailwindcss RUN go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest RUN go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest # Produce Binary RUN tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/style.min.css RUN templ generate RUN sqlc --file ./internal/db/config/sqlc.yaml generate RUN go build -o /usr/local/bin/app ./cmd CMD [ &quot;app&quot; ] </code></pre> <p>The problem I see here is that the build times are a lot longer none of the intall tool commands are cached (There is probably a way but I don&#39;t know yet). The produced go binary comes out to be just about 15 mb but we can see here that the containers are too big for such a small task</p> <pre><code>$ docker images REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE todo-app latest 92322069832a 2 minutes ago 2.42GB postgres 16-alpine d60bd50d7e2d 3 weeks ago 276MB </code></pre> <p>I was considering shipping just the binary but that requires postgres so I bundle both postgres and my app to run using docker compose. There has to be a way to build and ship faster. Hence why I&#39;m here. I know go-alpine has a smaller size that still wouldn&#39;t justify a binary as small as 15 mb</p> <p>How do you guys ship go web applications.
