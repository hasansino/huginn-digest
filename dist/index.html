<p>Hi Gophers! Today we&rsquo;re excited to announce our <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wwSstC8vv4Ymkm?s=b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">2025 Go Developer Survey</a>. The Go Team uses the results of this annual survey to better understand the needs and concerns of Go developers across the world. Your feedback helps us brainstorm, plan, and prioritize work on Go.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3wwSstC8vv4Ymkm?s=b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">take the survey here</a>. It will be open through <strong>September 30th</strong>. The survey should take 10 ‚Äì 20 minutes to complete, and every question is optional.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll share aggregated survey results on this blog in early November. This year we&rsquo;ll also share the raw dataset of survey responses, so that the entire Go community can benefit from this knowledge and conduct your own analyses on the data. Similar to our approach with <a href="/blog/gotelemetry">Go Telemetry</a>, we&rsquo;re using an opt-in model: the survey will ask for your permission to include your responses in the dataset. If you don&rsquo;t give us permission, your survey responses will not be shared.</p>
<p>Please help us reach as many Go developers as possible! We love it when you share the survey with your colleagues, friends, and online communities. The more voices we hear, the better we can understand the diverse needs of Go developers everywhere.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to hearing your feedback!</p>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a new crate that solves a problem I faced in bioinformatics, and I&#39;d love to get your feedback on the API and design.</p> <h1>## The Problem</h1> <p>The odgi toolkit is an incredibly powerful C++ library for working with pangenome variation graphs. However, using it programmatically from Rust means dealing with a complex and unsafe FFI boundary. I wanted to access its high-performance algorithms without sacrificing Rust&#39;s safety guarantees.</p> <h1>## The Solution: odgi-ffi</h1> <p>To solve this, I created odgi-ffi, a high-level, idiomatic Rust library that provides safe and easy-to-use bindings for odgi. It uses the cxx crate to handle the FFI complexity internally, so you can query and analyze pangenome graphs safely.</p> <p>TL;DR: It lets you use the odgi C++ graph library as if it were a native Rust library.</p> <h1>## Key Features ü¶Ä</h1> <ul> <li>Safe &amp; Idiomatic API: No need to manage raw pointers or unsafe blocks in your code.</li> <li>Load &amp; Query Graphs: Easily load .odgi files and query graph properties (node count, path names, node sequences, etc.).</li> <li>Topological Traversal: Get node successors and predecessors to walk the graph.</li> <li>Coordinate Projection: Project nucleotide positions on paths to their corresponding nodes and offsets.</li> <li>Thread-Safe: The Graph object is Send + Sync, making it trivial to use with rayon for high-performance parallel analysis.</li> <li>Built-in Conversion: Includes simple functions to convert between GFA and ODGI formats.</li> </ul> <h1>## Who is this for?</h1> <p>This library is for bioinformaticians and developers who:</p> <ul> <li>Want to build custom pangenome analysis tools in Rust.</li> <li>Love the performance of odgi but prefer the safety and ergonomics of Rust.</li> <li>Need to integrate variation graph queries into a larger Rust-based bioinformatics pipeline.</li> </ul> <p>After a long journey to get the documentation built correctly, everything is finally up and running. I&#39;m really looking for feedback on the API design, feature requests, or any bugs you might find.

What I wonder is why do I need to specify a &#39;T: Debug&#39; constraint as well in the declaration of Bar? Wouldn&#39;t it be enough to simply check only when trying to construct a Foo? Then it would be impossible to get a Foo&lt;T&gt; that doesn&#39;t satisfy &#39;T: Debug&#39; so it would be redundant to propagate that constraint right?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prestigious_Roof_902"> /u/Prestigious_Roof_902 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1niqgck/why_does_rust_check_type_constraints_on_type/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1niqgck/why_does_rust_check_type_constraints_on_type/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I‚Äôve written quite a few large apis in node/deno, and usually have distinct concrete types for api models and db rows. Usually to obscure int id‚Äôs, format/parse datetimes, and pick/omit properties.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs my question; what is the idiomatic way to do this mapping? Derive/proc-macros (if so, how?), traits and/or From impls? Currently I do the mapping manually, picking and transforming each and every property. This gets tedious though, and the scope of this api is large enough that I feel a more sophisticated mapping is warranted. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for any advice :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PravuzSC"> /u/PravuzSC </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1niong3/type_mapping_db_row_types_api_types/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1niong3/type_mapping_db_row_types_api_types/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I feel like I&#39;m in a place with my rust skills that is likely pretty common.

Or at least most of the compile errors I get make sense and I can solve them.</p> <p>Overall, my big issue is I find myself cloning too much. Or at least I think I am at least. Ive read that new rust devs should just clone and move on while trying to get a feel for the language, but obviously I want to increase my skills.</p> <p>I&#39;m basically looking for advice on how to minimize cloning. I&#39;ll list a few situations off the top of my head, but general advice is also great.</p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> <p>PS.

This I&#39;ve been planning to Google documentation on, just wanted to put it on the list.</p></li> <li><p>Creating derived data structures. Ie, a struct that is populated with items from an existing struct and I don&#39;t want to transfer ownership, or creating new vectors/hashmaps/etc as intermediate values in a function. I end up cloning the data to do this.</p></li> <li><p>Strings. Omfg coming from Java strings in rust drive me mad. I find myself calling to_string() on am &amp;str far too often, I have to be doing something wrong. And also, conveying OsString to String/star is just weird.</p></li> <li><p>Lifetimes. I understand them in principle, but I never know where the right place to use them is. Better use of lifetimes may be the solution to some of my other problems.</p></li> </ol> <p>Anyway, that&#39;s a non-exhsustive list. I&#39;m open to input.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everybody, I am new to Rust and started learning a couple months ago. I first went through the entire book on their own website, and am now making my own little projects in order to learn how to use the language better. I stumbled upon a site called <a href="https://exercism.org/dashboard">Exercism</a> and am completing the exercises over there in order to get more familiar with the syntax and way of thinking.</p> <p>Today I had an exercise where I felt like the way I needed to solve it seemed convoluted compared to how I would normally want to solve it.</p> <p>This was the exercise I got:</p> <h1>Instructions</h1> <p>For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.</p> <p>Given a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb. For example, given the list <code>[&quot;nail&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;rider&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;kingdom&quot;]</code>, you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:</p> <pre><code>For want of a nail the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe the horse was lost. For want of a horse the rider was lost. For want of a rider the message was lost. For want of a message the battle was lost. For want of a battle the kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a nail. </code></pre> <p>Note that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content. No line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.Instructions<br/> For want of a horseshoe nail, a kingdom was lost, or so the saying goes.<br/> Given a list of inputs, generate the relevant proverb.<br/> For example, given the list [&quot;nail&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;rider&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;kingdom&quot;], you will output the full text of this proverbial rhyme:<br/> For want of a nail the shoe was lost.<br/> For want of a shoe the horse was lost.<br/> For want of a horse the rider was lost.<br/> For want of a rider the message was lost.<br/> For want of a message the battle was lost.<br/> For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.<br/> And all for the want of a nail. </p> <p>Note that the list of inputs may vary; your solution should be able to handle lists of arbitrary length and content.<br/> No line of the output text should be a static, unchanging string; all should vary according to the input given.</p> <p>I solved it this way for the exercise:</p> <pre><code>pub fn build_proverb(list: &amp;[&amp;str]) -&gt; String { if list.is_empty() { return String::new(); } let mut lines = Vec::new(); for window in list.windows(2) { let first = window[0]; let second = window[1]; lines.push(format!(&quot;For want of a {first} the {second} was lost.&quot;)); } lines.push(format!(&quot;And all for the want of a {}.&quot;, list[0])); lines.join(&quot;\n&quot;) } </code></pre> <p>The function was already given and needed to return a String, otherwise the tests would&#39;t succeed.</p> <p>Now locally, I changed it to this:</p> <pre><code>fn main() { let list = [&quot;nail&quot;, &quot;shoe&quot;, &quot;horse&quot;, &quot;rider&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;kingdom&quot;]; build_proverb(&amp;list); } pub fn build_proverb(list: &amp;[&amp;str]) { let mut n = 0; while n &lt; list.len() - 1 { println!(&quot;For want of a {} the {} was lost.&quot;, list[n], list[n + 1]); n += 1 } println!(&quot;And all for the want of a {}.&quot;, list[0]); } </code></pre> <p>I believe the reason the exercise is made this way is purely in order to learn how to correctly use different concepts, but I wonder if my version is allowed in Rust or is considered unconventional.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheSkyBreaker01"> /u/TheSkyBreaker01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nifr6t/learning_rust_and_a_bit_unclear_about_an_exercise/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nifr6t/learning_rust_and_a_bit_unclear_about_an_exercise/">[comments]</a></span></div>

My question is whether the tablet repository could query or JOIN with the board table (which is managed by the other repo) to search for boards not associated with that tablet. Would that be okay? What persistence pattern should I use in such cases? DAO for entities and repositories for more complex actions?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all - I have seen flavours of this question asked here and other forums but was hoping someone may have some guidance on how to approach a problem I have at work.</p> <p>Based upon reasons that are beyond my control it has been deemed necessary to have a rules engine in our Go repo where we can configure it per company. Essentially it would be based on the company and data specific to that company, an example would be:</p> <p><code>WHEN company.this = something AND company.that = something_else THEN do_task()</code> </p> <p>The tasks would essentially be calling other services to automate things we would normally have to hardcode logic for per company (as a rules engine does I suppose). And these rules can be altered by non-engineers so hard-coding here is not viable long term.</p> <p>Anyway, my real question is around the fact we do not have the time to implement our own rules engine, nor do we want to. Has anyone successfully used <a href="https://github.com/hyperjumptech/grule-rule-engine">Grule</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gorules/zen">GoRules</a> in production? We don&#39;t particularly want to pay for a product, so finding an open source library we can plug into our backend while we build a frontend is ideal. Or any other alternatives? Just looking for some words from the wise here as I am aware that building our rules engine would likely not be worth the effort - looking for the least effort in terms of using something to evaluate rules / expressions that we would store per company</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious_Peanut_97"> /u/Mysterious_Peanut_97 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nik6rg/business_rules_engine_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nik6rg/business_rules_engine_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>
