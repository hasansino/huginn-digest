            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A year ago, I was knee-deep in Golang, trying to build a simple <a href="https://github.com/fahimfaisaal/exp-go-concurrency/blob/main/concurrent-queue/queue.go">concurrent queue</a> as a learning project. Coming from a Node.js background, where I‚Äôd spent years working with tools like BullMQ and RabbitMQ, Go‚Äôs concurrency model felt like a puzzle. My first attempt‚Äîa minimal queue with round-robin channel selection‚Äîwas, well, buggy. Let‚Äôs just say it worked until it didn‚Äôt.</p> <p>But that‚Äôs how learning goes, right?</p> <h2>The Spark of an Idea</h2> <p>In my professional work, I‚Äôve used tools like BullMQ and RabbitMQ for event-driven solutions, and p-queue and p-limit for handling concurrency. Naturally, I began wondering if there were similar tools in Go. I found packages like <code>asynq</code>, <code>ants</code>, and various worker pools‚Äîsolid, battle-tested options. But suddenly, a thought struck me: what if I built something different? A package with zero dependencies, high concurrency control, and designed as a message queue rather than submitting functions?</p> <p>With that spark, I started building my first Go package, released it, and named it <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/fahimfaisaal/gocq">Gocq</a> (Go Concurrent Queue). The core API was straightforward, as you can see here:</p> <p>```go // Create a queue with 2 concurrent workers queue := gocq.NewQueue(2, func(data int) int { time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond) return data * 2 }) defer queue.Close()</p> <p>// Add a single job result := &lt;-queue.Add(5) fmt.Println(result) // Output: 10</p> <p>// Add multiple jobs results := queue.AddAll(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for result := range results { fmt.Println(result) // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (unordered) } ```</p> <p>From the excitement, I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1j5k9g8/i_built_a_concurrency_queue_that_might_bring_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posted</a> it on Reddit. To my surprise, it got traction‚Äîupvotes, comments, and appreciations. Here‚Äôs the fun part: coming from the Node.js ecosystem, I totally messed up Go‚Äôs package system at first.</p> <p>Within a week, I released the next version with a few major changes and shared it on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jcdsxo/gocq_is_now_on_v2_now_faster_smarter_and_fancier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">again</a>. More feedback rolled in, and one person asked for &quot;persistence abstractions support&quot;.</p> <h2>The Missing Piece</h2> <p>That hit home‚ÄîI‚Äôd felt this gap before, <strong>Persistence</strong>. It‚Äôs the backbone of any reliable queue system. Without persistence, the package wouldn‚Äôt be complete. But then a question is: if I add persistence, would I have to tie it to a specific tool like Redis or another database?</p> <p>I didn‚Äôt want to lock users into Redis, SQLite, or any specific storage. What if the queue could adapt to any database?</p> <p>So I tore gocq apart.</p> <p>I rewrote most of it, splitting the core into two parts: a worker pool and a queue interface. The worker would pull jobs from the queue without caring where those jobs lived.</p> <p>The result? <a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ</a>, a queue system that doesn‚Äôt care if your storage is Redis, SQLite, or even in-memory.</p> <h2>How It Works Now</h2> <p>Imagine you need a simple, in-memory queue:</p> <p><code>go w := varmq.NewWorker(func(data any) (any, error) { return nil, nil }, 2) q := w.BindQueue() // Done. No setup, no dependencies. </code></p> <p>if you want persistence, just plug in an adapter. Let‚Äôs say SQLite:</p> <p>```go import &quot;github.com/goptics/sqliteq&quot;</p> <p>db := sqliteq.New(&quot;test.db&quot;) pq, _ := db.NewQueue(&quot;orders&quot;) q := w.WithPersistentQueue(pq) // Now your jobs survive restarts. ```</p> <p>Or Redis for distributed workloads:</p> <p>```go import &quot;github.com/goptics/redisq&quot;</p> <p>rdb := redisq.New(&quot;redis://localhost:6379&quot;) pq := rdb.NewDistributedQueue(&quot;transactions&quot;) q := w.WithDistributedQueue(pq) // Scale across servers. ```</p> <p>The magic? The worker doesn‚Äôt know‚Äîor care‚Äîwhat‚Äôs behind the queue. It just processes jobs.</p> <h2>Lessons from the Trenches</h2> <p>Building this taught me two big things:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Simplicity is hard</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Feedback is gold</strong>.</li> </ol> <h2>Why This Matters</h2> <p>Message queues are everywhere‚Äîorder processing, notifications, data pipelines. But not every project needs Redis. Sometimes you just want SQLite for simplicity, or to switch databases later without rewriting code.</p> <p>With Varmq, you‚Äôre not boxed in. Need persistence? Add it. Need scale? Swap adapters. It‚Äôs like LEGO for queues.</p> <h2>What‚Äôs Next?</h2> <p>The next step is to integrate the PostgreSQL adapter and a monitoring system. </p> <p>If you‚Äôre curious, check out <a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">Varmq on GitHub</a>.

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kifznk/why_does_gos_forrange_loop_return_indexes_not/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, Reddit! This post is about very simple, but, IMHO, interesting Go language syntax &amp; semantic ¬´feature¬ª.</p> <h1>Background</h1> <p>Recently, our dev team joined a newcomer from C++ developer position. He was in some sense new to Go language.</p> <p>He was implementing an interesting feature related to Distributed Systems. And in many languages like C++, Java, Python, etc. a very common for-range loop over array / vector / any container is iterating over <strong>items</strong> (that seems to me intuitive) of that container, not <strong>indexes</strong> of that items, like in Go. E.g, in the following case</p> <pre><code>for x := range []string{&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;world&quot;} { fmt.Println(x) } </code></pre> <p>the output will be</p> <pre><code>0 1 </code></pre> <p>and not</p> <pre><code>hello world </code></pre> <p>A new developer messed up this semantics (due to his previous experience, I suppose) and unknowingly iterated over indexes instead of slice items. Because of moderate Merge Request size, reviewers also skipped this mistake. Fully understandable human factor. Someone may ask ¬´how did this code passed tests¬ª and I will say that there was another one design flaw leading up this code to master branch.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this code got into production, and even if not immediately, led to very unexpected behaviour and very fun and long debug session üòÅ</p> <h1>Discussion</h1> <p>I would like to ask you, do you consider the syntax for such kind of for-range loops over slices and arrays counter-intuitive?</p> <pre><code>for x := range items { // x - index of item } </code></pre> <p>I <strong>totally</strong> understand that it is enough to rewrite it to</p> <pre><code>for _, x := range items { // x - the item itself } </code></pre> <p>It&#39;s a matter of habit. <em>But ¬´habitually¬ª is not always ¬´conveniently¬ª and ¬´intuitively¬ª.</em> Also remember how does it work with channels, which are iterated over items, not indices.</p> <h1>Solution</h1> <p>I&#39;ve implemented a <a href="https://github.com/m0t9/meanind">linter</a> that searches <code>for-range</code> loops over slices / arrays, but iterating over items&#39; <strong>indices</strong>. If it considers variable name (that is iterating over collection) as something <em>meaningful</em>, that is not the usual case for indexes, it reports it. Full rules are described in the <a href="https://github.com/m0t9/meanind?tab=readme-ov-file#details">README</a> (TL;DR ‚Äî case-insensitive regular expressions marking <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>.*idx</code>, <code>idx.*</code>, <code>ind</code>, ... as suitable index name)</p> <p>This linter also has tiny customization, it&#39;s understandable that in some contexts different rules for indexes names may be applied. Moreover, I suppose the code of this linter may be useful for guys who want to implement their linters (compatible with <code>go vet</code> and <code>golangci-lint</code>) or in other way work with Go AST.</p> <p>For instance, the code below will be reported</p> <pre><code>for name := range names { _ = name } for n := range names { _ = n } </code></pre> <p>But the following cases won&#39;t</p> <pre><code>for i, item := range arr { } for i := range arr { ... } for arrayInd := range arr { ... } for meaningfulName := range arr { _ = arr[meaningfulName] // USED as index } </code></pre> <p>I will be glad for ratings and suggestions in the linter, as well as discussions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/m0t9_"> /u/m0t9_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/m0t9/meanind">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kifznk/why_does_gos_forrange_loop_return_indexes_not/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Unity is currently sending emails threatening longtime developers with disabling their access completely over bogus data about private versus public licenses. Their initial email (included below) contained no details at all, but a requirement to &quot;comply&quot; otherwise they reserved the right to revoke our access by May 16th.</p> <p>When pressed for details, they replied with five emails. Two of which are the names of employees <em>at another local company</em> who have never worked for us, and the name of an employee who does not work on Unity at the studio.</p> <p>I believe this is a chilling look into the future of Unity Technologies as a company and a product we develop on. Unity are threatening to revoke our access to continue development, and feel emboldened to do so casually and without evidence. Then when pressed for evidence, they have produced something that would be laughable - except that they <em>somehow</em> gathered various names that call into question how they gather and scrape data. This methodology is completely flawed, and then being applied dangerously - with short-timeframe threats to revoke all license access.</p> <p>Our studio has already sunset Unity as a technology, but this situation heavily affects one unreleased game of ours (Torpedia) and a game we lose money on, but are very passionate about (Stationeers). I feel most for our team members on Torpedia, who have spent years on this game.</p> <h1>Detailed Outline</h1> <p>I am Dean Hall, I created a game called DayZ which I sold to Bohemia Interactive, and used the money to found my own studio called RocketWerkz in 2014.</p> <p>Development with Unity has made up a significant portion of our products since the company was founded, with a spend of probably over 300K though this period, currently averaging about 30K per year. This has primarily included our game Stationeers, but also an unreleased game called Torpedia. Both of these games are on PC. We also develop using Unreal, and recently our own internal technology called BRUTAL (a C# mapping of Vulkan).</p> <p>On May 9th Unity sent us the following email:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Hi RocketWerkz team,</em></p> <p><em>I am reaching out to inform you that the Unity Compliance Team has flagged your account for potential compliance violations with our terms of service. Click here to review our terms of service.</em></p> <p><em>As a reminder - there can be no mixing of Unity license types and according to our data you currently have users using Unity Personal licenses when they should under the umbrella of your Unity Pro subscription.</em></p> <p><em>We kindly request that you take immediate action to ensure your compliance with these terms. If you do not, we reserve the right to revoke your company&#39;s existing licenses on May, 16th 2025.</em></p> <p><em>Please work to resolve this to prevent your access from being revoked. I have included your account manager, Kelly Frazier, to this thread.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>We replied asking for detail and eventually received the following from Kelly Frazier at Unity:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Our systems show the following users have been logging in with Personal Edition licenses. In order to remain compliant with Unity&#39;s terms of service, the following users will need to be assigned a Pro license:</em> </p> </blockquote> <p>Then there are five listed items they supplies as evidence:</p> <ul> <li>An @ rocketwerkz email, for a team member who has Unity Personal and does not work on a Unity project at the studio</li> <li>The personal email address of a Rocketwerkz employee, whom we pay for a Unity Pro License for</li> <li>An @ rocketwerkz email, for an external contractor who was provided one of our Unity Pro Licenses for a period in 2024 to do some work at the time</li> <li>An obscured email domain, but the name of which is an employee at a company in Dunedin (New Zealand, where we are based) who has never worked for us</li> <li>An obscured email domain, another employee at the same company above, but who never worked for us.</li> </ul> <p>Most recently, our company paid Unity USD 43,294.87 on 21 Dec 2024, for our pro licenses.</p> <p>Not a <em>single</em> one of those is a breach - but more concerningly the two employees who work at another studio - that studio is located where our studio was <em>founded</em> and where our accountants are based - and therefore where the registered address for our company is <em>online</em> if you use the government company website.</p> <p>Beyond Unity threatening long-term customers with immediate revocation of licenses over shaky evidence - this raises some <em>serious</em> questions about how Unity is scraping this data and then processing it.</p> <p>This should serve as a serious warning to all developers about the future we face with Unity development.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thedeanhall"> /u/thedeanhall </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kiyh0m/unity_is_threatening_to_revoke_all_licenses_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kiyh0m/unity_is_threatening_to_revoke_all_licenses_for/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I previously worked as a frontend developer in Japan and have been looking for work since quitting my job at the end of last year. I wasn&#39;t specifically targeting Rust positions, but surprisingly, there are more companies using Rust in Japan than I imagined, and possibly due to the shortage of candidates, it&#39;s often easier to get interview opportunities. There are roughly 10-20 small to medium-sized companies recruiting Rust developers. Many large companies use Rust as well, but they typically prefer to find employees willing to write Rust from within their organization.</p> <p>Most companies use Rust to develop web backends, but there are also many interesting use cases such as quantum computing, aerospace, and high-performance computing. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get interview opportunities with these companies.</p> <p>Most companies didn&#39;t hire me due to language issues (I think). I successfully joined one company that developed a system using Rust about three years ago and needed someone to maintain it, but struggled to find people with Rust development experience.</p> <p>Interestingly, during the interview, they asked me &quot;Are you familiar with macros? Because the system has many macros,&quot; which made me a bit nervous at the time. However, after joining, I found that macros weren&#39;t overused - they were mainly used to generate repetitive CRUD code.</p> <p>The system I&#39;m currently developing is an internal management system for a company. It doesn&#39;t have many users and doesn&#39;t actually require high performance. The previous maintainer didn&#39;t seem very enthusiastic about Rust and didn&#39;t use idiomatic Rust - the system has a lot of unwrap calls, but it&#39;s not particularly painful to work with. Compared to other languages, Rust gives me more confidence when facing legacy systems. I hope to gradually refactor it over time, at least eliminating unnecessary unwrap calls.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mitsuyue"> /u/mitsuyue </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kixsgx/my_experience_finding_rust_jobs_in_japan/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kixsgx/my_experience_finding_rust_jobs_in_japan/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started the YouTube TUI weeks after learning Rust, here is my story on the YouTube TUI spanning from the beginning of my Rust journey to current date.</p> <p>I am writing this now because I had just pushed my first content update to the project, after abandoning it for over a year, and had the sudden urge to look through commit history to see how that happened.</p> <hr/> <p>The YouTube TUI was my first large Rust project. Before that I used to write Discord bots in node.js, just as how I used to be 16. Cool.</p> <p>I think its around 2021 when I saw one of those &quot;best programming language to learn in [current year]&quot; featuring Rust, I forgot why I chose to learn Rust, but I Rust Lang booked three separate times as going from the typeless JavaScript to the very strongly typed Rust felt a bit restrictive, and it was weird to unlearn how JavaScript worked.</p> <p>Around the same time I have just installed Arch with KDE, eager to rice my desktop up and farm some sweet sweet karma on <a href="/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a>, I shifted a lot of my workflow from browsers and electron apps to the terminal, because KDE terminal themes are amazing (especially the glass panel ones).</p> <p>One of the main things I wanted to include in the screenshot was YouTube, to me watching YouTube was one of the main functions of a computer. So I went on GitHub to hunt for a terminal UI for YouTube, I found ytfzf but to me it didn&#39;t look very aesthetically appealing, and function wise it is a search-and-play thing, not really what I was looking for.</p> <p>The normal person would&#39;ve probably eaten it up and called it a day, but 16 year old me really want that internet validation from the <a href="/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> people, so I went to learn how to write a TUI in Rust with the <code>tui</code> crate (that was before it got discontinued and forked to <code>ratatui</code>, I must say the original <code>tui</code> have much simpler examples, which is great), did a bit of digging on how ytfzf works - found out about invidious, a YouTube proxy and API provider that provides a very simple way to get information about YouTube content, and that&#39;s how the project started.</p> <hr/> <p>Because the whole project started with the goal of &quot;looking good&quot; so I can farm karma, the UI started before the backend, which is usually not how you start a project.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ue2xwr/media_youtube_tui_progress_read_comments/">First post on r/rust about the project, 28/04/2022</a></li> </ul> <p>There was slight amount of encouragements from the community, not a big attention thing, but enough attention to keep my validation seeking 16 year old self to stay high on adrenalin and continued. Shortly after I figured that my code was really rubbish, and had to rewrite the entire thing to allow the UI to connect to the API, leading to...</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ulxvli/media_youtube_tui_progress_2_because_nobody_asked/">Second post on r/rust, 09/05/2022</a></li> </ul> <p>Got some karma, I thought I was cool with the title, it wasn&#39;t, but the karma was still high in my veins, and next comes...</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/rust/comments/v2e12v/media_youtube_tui_written_in_rust_progress_3/">Third post on r/rust, 01/06/2022</a></li> </ul> <p>The project has completed its first goals - that is to play videos. You can see I was still hot in making Minecraft edits at the time from what I was playing.</p> <p>And shortly after that I noticed how everything is hard coded, and to add a new feature I have to change the code all over the place, so that means a full rewrite again. This time I wrote a UI framework instead, then used it to write the TUI, the framework was only a few hundreds of line of code, but it was well thought out and declarative, this pinned down my TUI code to not to include too much hard coded boilerplate. It is the only reason why the code is still vaguely maintainable today.</p> <p>I then implemented a rss feed-like subscription system, and followed by an embedded music player in the next few months to improve its functionality as a music player.</p> <p>-<a href="https://reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/136ywvo/browse_youtube_in_term_with_youtube_tui/">Post in r/commandline 03/05/2023</a></p> <p>Then at that time my internet connection was constantly going in and out, so I added feature to download YouTube playlists to an offline library, so I can still have YouTube TUI as a music player when there&#39;s no internet.</p> <p>Then comes the Reddit blackout, and I have not posted on the site for around 2 years before coming back to talk to people from the Minecraft server constantiam.net.</p> <hr/> <p>Around that time YouTube started waging war on Invidious, and YouTube TUI is really feeling the consequence of that.</p> <p>The YouTube TUI runs as so: 1. Render current state to the screen. 2. Wait for key (or mouse) input. 3. Process the key or mouse input, and update internal state, go to step 1.</p> <p>The &quot;process the key or mouse input&quot; bit includes fetching video information from the Invidious API, this used to be quite fast at under a second, therefore the TUI freezes for a fraction of a second at step 3, before the new state is rendered, and becomes responsive again (at step 2).</p> <p>After YouTube started to block Invidious the response time skyrocketed, going up to 10 seconds, having the TUI to freeze up to 10 second was not enjoyable, while I could become ungovernable by switching to use yt-dlp as a backend, I for some reason didn&#39;t, but rather fixated on a much cooler idea instead:</p> <ul> <li><p>The current YouTube TUI sucked when response time are high because there is a single blocking event loop At that time because I was using the framework mentioned earlier, I was effectively defining individual visual components, then defining a layout to put them on the screen, and since multithreading is needed to solve this response time issue, why not...</p></li> <li><p>Instead of defining multiple components in a single program then put them on a layout, I came up with the idea of writing a central layout manager, where each separate program represents a display component, and communicates with the layout manager to render the component on the terminal screen. Congratulations, I have just invented a window manager.</p></li> </ul> <p>But a layout manager is still a bit too restrictive, what if I write a display server, where anyone can send a request to set a particular character on a terminal just like how a program can send a request to light a particular pixel on your 1980x1080 screen? And THEN build a display server in terms of that? That sounded like a good idea to me, so I brought in tokio as dependency and started working, big mistake.</p> <p>I worked on the project for 2 whole weeks over the Christmas break 2023-2024, not once have I compiled the project, the project uses the following ideas - The central display server is async, using tokio - The client communicates with the server through unix sockets, requests are serialised with serde_json - Each component holds a &quot;lock&quot; to the event, to ensure the key and mouse events are passed to each component in order.</p> <p>The final goal of the project is to port YouTube TUI to the new project.</p> <hr/> <p>This is one of the more insane things I&#39;ve done, 2 weeks without testing is a really, really long time, but in the end it compiled without issue, and I started on writing the layout manager I was set out to make, and a few other basic components, building several proof-of-concept apps. - <a href="https://github.com/ccanvas/ccanvas-layout_old">The layout manager</a> - <a href="https://github.com/ccanvas/ccanvas-saver_old">Screen saver for restricting screen size</a></p> <p>It was all going smoothly until I realised how bad the implementation was. First of all, this thing is a beast in CPU usage, completely undoing the performance advantages of a TUI. I found that with hundreds of events, and more requests sent each second. - The tokio async runtime felt really, really bad performing, not as in it doesn&#39;t work, its just not made for this. - serde_json becomes a joke, to light up a single pixel, a full JSON request will have to be sent, to draw a single window, hundreds of these JSON will have to be sent, the implementation quickly becomes an IO and serialisation nightmare. - deadlocks, a lot of them, first with tokio, quite unpredictable, but the worst offender is the multithreading by having multiple programs running at the same time, because of the nature of the TUI, i cannot just println! the error that is going on, I had to use system notification to debug things, absolute nightmare, wouldn&#39;t wish it on my worst enemy.</p> <p>I was fully burnt out, and completely done with TUIs at that point for the next year, I went and did other things with Rust, most of them involves backend libraries and stuff. And none of them gained as much traction as the TUI did, but that&#39;s okay, life is great, and I only have to patch up the mess I created when I was 16 every once in a while when someone opened a GitHub issue, but slowly I started to ignore new issues, and for the entire year YouTube TUI was edging near abandoned to an unusable state.</p> <hr/> <p>The next relevant event didn&#39;t happen until next year Christmas (2024-2025), as if I was trying to make this ccanvas thing a Christmas tradition. I restarted the ccanvas project, taking much care to design different parts of the whole system as well as the protocol using to create them, and now I have something within the hundred of times more efficient that the version from the previous year.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/ccanvas/ccanvas/blob/master/design/src/SUMMARY.md">New ccanvas design document</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/ccanvas/libccanvas">implementation of the protocol in libccanvas (no readme)</a></li> </ul> <p>In the end, no display server was made, but I did made a pretty sick and efficient protocol with a near 0 second parse time, by near zero i really mean it, the only thing taking time in the entire parsing process was 2 match statements, just to stress how incredibly fast this new version of things is.</p> <p>If I ever were to pick the project back up again, I will be continuing from where I left off, its just genuinely that great, if in the unlike case that u would want to do something with it, for a display server or as an IPC protocol, let me know so I can provide some help.</p> <hr/> <p>And this brings us to present day, I cleared a bunch of GitHub issues I&#39;ve procrastinated over a year, and most importantly I&#39;ve booted up the TUI for personal use after a very long time, and it was quite dang good. The fire is burning once again, and we&#39;ll see where that leads us.</p> <p>Try YouTube TUI:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/Siriusmart/youtube-tui">YouTube TUI (GitHub)</a></li> <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/youtube-tui">YouTube TUI (crates.io)</a></li> <li><a href="https://siriusmart.github.io/youtube-tui/">YouTube TUI (user manual)</a></li> </ul> <p>But the goal of this post is surprise surprise not to plug my project, I was just having a nostalgic trip of &quot;damn, have I really not updated this project for so long?&quot; I think I am romanticising it a bit too much, but I think this project is why I am here as who I am today.</p> <p>I am very grateful of having encouragements from the community on my first project, I wouldn&#39;t have pushed forward with it if it wasn&#39;t for that. And if it wasn&#39;t for the project getting traction, I might have not continued in enjoying minding my own business with projects and stuff. It has been a really fun journey and since exactly here is where all this began, I would just like to say a huge thanks to every one of you in the Rust community, you guys have shaped my past 3 years in massively positive ways.</p> <p>Peace, Sirius, a learning rustacean.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Siriusmart"> /u/Siriusmart </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kiuvvz/story_the_youtube_tui_3_years_of_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kiuvvz/story_the_youtube_tui_3_years_of_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a rust newbie, but I&#39;ve got some 25 years of experience in C, C++ and other languages. So no surprise I love Rust. </p> <p>As a hobbyproject to learn Rust, I&#39;m writing a multiplayer football manager game. But, I&#39;m stepping farther and farther away from the compiler&#39;s borrow checking. First, I tried using references, which failed since my datamodel required me to access Players from both a Team, and a Lineup for an ongoing Match. </p> <p>So I sprayed the code with Rc instead. Worked nicely, until I began having to modify the Players and Match; Gotta move that ball you know!</p> <p>Aha! RefCell! Only.... That may cause panic!() unless using try_borrow() or try_borrow_mut(). Which can fail if there are any other borrow() of the opposite mutability. </p> <p>So, that&#39;s basically a poor man&#39;s single-threaded mutex. Only, a trivial try_borow/_mut can cause an Err, which needs to be propagated uwards all the way until I can generate a 501 Internal Server Error and dump the trace. Because, what else to do? </p> <p>Seriously considering dumping this datamodel and instead implementing Iter()s that all return &amp;Players from a canonical Vec&lt;Player&gt; in each Team instead. </p> <p>I&#39;m all for changing; when I originally learnt programming, I did it by writing countless text adventure games, and BBS softwares, experimenting with different solutions. </p> <p>It was suggested here that I should use an ECS-based framework such as Bevy (or maybe I should go for a small one) . But is it really good in this case? Each logged in User will only ever see Players from two Teams on the same screen, but the database will contain thousands of Players.</p> <p>Opinions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flundstrom2"> /u/flundstrom2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kidzha/ref_cell_drives_me_nuts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kidzha/ref_cell_drives_me_nuts/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>3 months ago, <a href="/u/noblevarghese96">u/noblevarghese96</a> introduced Espanso to me and told me we can build something similar but which reduces the pain of adding new shortcuts. That&#39;s how we started to build snipt.</p> <p>It&#39;s very easy to add a shortcut in snipt, you can do that using the add command or by interactively using the TUI. Here&#39;s how Snipt has transformed my daily workflow:</p> <h1>Simple Text Expansion</h1> <p>Snipt uses just two leader keys:</p> <ul> <li><code>:</code> for simple text expansion</li> <li><code>!</code> for script/command execution and parameterised snippets</li> </ul> <p>The most basic use case is expanding shortcuts into frequently used text. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Type <code>:email</code> ‚Üí expands to [<code>your.email@example.com</code>](mailto:<a href="mailto:your.email@example.com">your.email@example.com</a>)</li> <li>Type <code>:addr</code> ‚Üí expands to your full mailing address</li> <li>Type <code>:standup</code> ‚Üí expands to your daily standup template</li> </ul> <p>Adding these is as simple as:</p> <pre><code>snipt add email your.email@example.com </code></pre> <h1>URL Automation</h1> <p>Snipt can open websites for you when you use the <code>!</code> leader key:</p> <ul> <li>Type <code>!gh</code> ‚Üí opens GitHub if your snippet contains a URL</li> <li>Type <code>!drive</code> ‚Üí opens Google Drive</li> <li>Type <code>!jira</code> ‚Üí opens your team&#39;s JIRA board</li> </ul> <p>Adding a URL shortcut is just as easy:</p> <pre><code>snipt add gh https://github.com </code></pre> <h1>Command Execution</h1> <p>Snipt can execute shell commands and insert the output wherever you&#39;re typing:</p> <ul> <li>Type <code>!date</code> ‚Üí inserts the current date and time</li> <li>Type <code>!ip</code> ‚Üí inserts your current IP address</li> <li>Type <code>!weather</code> ‚Üí inserts current weather information</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>snipt add date &quot;date &#39;+%A, %B %d, %Y&#39;&quot; </code></pre> <h1>Scripts in Any Language</h1> <p>This is where Snipt really shines! You can write scripts in Python, JavaScript, or any language that supports a shebang line, and trigger them with a simple shortcut:</p> <h1>Python Script</h1> <pre><code>snipt add py-hello &quot;#!/usr/bin/env python3 print(&#39;Hello from Python!&#39;)&quot; </code></pre> <h1>JavaScript Script</h1> <pre><code>snipt add js-hello &quot;#!/usr/bin/env node console.log(&#39;Hello from JavaScript!&#39;)&quot; </code></pre> <h1>Bash Script</h1> <pre><code>snipt add random-word &quot;#!/bin/bash shuf -n 1 /usr/share/dict/words&quot; </code></pre> <h1>Parameterized Shortcuts</h1> <p>Need dynamic content? Snipt supports parameterised shortcuts:</p> <pre><code>snipt add greet(name) &quot;echo &#39;Hello, $1! Hope you&#39;re having a great day.&#39;&quot; </code></pre> <p>Then just type <code>!greet(Sarah)</code> , and it expands to &quot;Hello, Sarah! Hope you&#39;re having a great day.&quot;</p> <h1>URL-Related Parameterised Shortcuts</h1> <p>URL parameters are where parameterised snippets really shine:</p> <pre><code>snipt add search(query) &quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=$1&quot; </code></pre> <p>Type <code>!search(rust programming)</code> to open a Google search for &quot;Rust programming&quot;.</p> <pre><code>snipt add repo(user,repo) &quot;https://github.com/$1/$2&quot; </code></pre> <p>Type <code>!repo(rust-lang,rust)</code> to open the Rust repository.</p> <pre><code>snipt add jira(ticket) &quot;https://your-company.atlassian.net/browse/$1&quot; </code></pre> <p>Type <code>!jira(PROJ-123)</code> to quickly navigate to a specific ticket.</p> <pre><code>snipt add yt(video) &quot;#!/bin/bash open &#39;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=$1&#39;&quot; </code></pre> <p>Type <code>!yt(rust tutorial)</code> to search for Rust tutorials on YouTube.</p> <h1>Context-Based Expansions</h1> <p>Snipt is smart enough to adapt to the application you&#39;re currently using. It automatically detects the frontend application and adjusts the expansion behaviour based on context:</p> <h1>Hyperlink Support</h1> <p>When you&#39;re working in apps that support hyperlinks like Slack, Teams, or Linear, Snipt automatically formats URL expansions properly:</p> <pre><code>snipt add docs &quot;https://docs.example.com&quot; </code></pre> <ul> <li>In a terminal: Directly opens the URL</li> <li>In Discord: Creates a clickable hyperlink</li> <li>In your browser: Opens the link in a new tab</li> </ul> <h1>Application-Specific Snippets</h1> <p>You can create snippets that behave differently based on the current application:</p> <pre><code>snipt add sig &quot;#!/bin/bash if [[ $(osascript -e &#39;tell application \&quot;System Events\&quot; to get name of first process whose frontmost is true&#39;) == \&quot;Mail\&quot; ]]; then echo \&quot;Best regards,\nYour Name\nYour Title | Your Company\&quot; else echo \&quot;- Your Name\&quot; fi&quot; </code></pre> <p>This snippet adapts your signature based on whether you&#39;re in Mail or another application!</p> <h1>Getting Started</h1> <p>Installation is straightforward:</p> <pre><code>cargo install snipt </code></pre> <p>The daemon runs in the background and works across all applications. The best part is how lightweight it is compared to other text expanders.</p> <p>If you&#39;re tired of repetitive typing or complex keyboard shortcuts, give Snipt a try. It&#39;s been a game-changer for my productivity, and the ability to use any scripting language makes it infinitely extensible.</p> <p>What snippets would you create to save time in your workflow?</p> <p>Check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/snipt/snipt">https://github.com/snipt/snipt</a></p> <h3>System Dependencies</h3> <h4>Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</h4> <p><code>bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libxi-dev libxtst-dev pkg-config libxdo-dev </code></p> <h4>Linux (Fedora/RHEL)</h4> <p><code>bash sudo dnf install libX11-devel libXi-devel libXtst-devel pkg-config libxdo-devel </code></p> <h4>Linux (Arch Linux)</h4> <p><code>bash sudo pacman -S libx11 libxi libxtst pkg-config xdotool </code></p> <h4>Linux (openSUSE)</h4> <p><code>bash sudo zypper install libX11-devel libXi-devel libXtst-devel pkg-config libxdo-devel </code></p> <p>Note: These dependencies are required for X11 window system integration and keyboard monitoring functionality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/New-Blacksmith8524"> /u/New-Blacksmith8524 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kic9tm/i_automated_most_of_my_typing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kic9tm/i_automated_most_of_my_typing/">[comments]</a></span></div>
