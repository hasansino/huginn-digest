Started learning and practicing Rust seriously last month or so. Currently I&#39;m an open-source maintainer and use Python for my projects (also used a bit of PHP and JS in the past).</p> <p>I wanted to add Rust to my toolbelt as well, though, because of the many interesting and critical problems it solves, so I set out to learn it. I don&#39;t learn new programming langs often, but when I do I think making games is a great way to do that, so I&#39;m making a small shmup game using Rust + SDL2 and free game assets from Kenney.</p> <p>It is my first Rust project (other than tiny tutorial stuff) and at a very early stage of development, so it is barely a prototype for now. So, please, keep that in mind.</p> <p>Even so, I&#39;m glad I managed to put something together that is capable of launching, managing state and resources and even allows a few interactions like shooting and hitting an enemy. Despite being used as a tool for me to learn Rust, this is a serious project that I intend to work on from time to time until completion, and is part of my portfolio of open-source public domain projects.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KennedyRichard"> /u/KennedyRichard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/esyr8t2g6gze1.gif">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1khcb5b/media_first_rust_project_public_domain_crate_shmup/">[comments]</a></span></div>

One of the recent additions is "time-travel debugging" which completely blew my mind. It's a great showcase for what functional, pure UI can accomplish. But can the Rust compiler help enforce this pureness?</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced"><code>iced</code></a>, a native UI library for Rust <em>inspired</em> by Elm architecture (which is a purely functional way of doing UI) for my app <a href="https://github.com/nik-rev/ferrishot"><code>ferrishot</code></a> (a desktop screenshot app inspired by flameshot)</p> <p>I recently came across a PR by the maintainer of iced which introduces <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/pull/2910">&quot;Time Travel Debugging&quot;</a>. </p> <p>Essentially, in iced there is <strong>only 1 enum</strong>, a <code>Message</code> which is responsible for mutating your application state. There is only <strong>1 place</strong> which receives this <code>Message</code>, the <code>update</code> method of your app. No other place can <em>ever</em> access <code>&amp;mut App</code>. </p> <p>This way of doing UI makes it highly effective to reason about your app. Because only <code>Message</code> can mutate the state, if you assemble all of the <code>Message</code>s you receives throughout 1 instance of the app into a <code>Vec&lt;(Instant, Message)&gt;</code>, (where <code>Instant</code> is when the <code>Message</code> happened).</p> <p>You have a complete 4-dimensional control over your app. You are able to go to any point of its existance. And view the entire state of the app. Rewind, go back into the future etc. It&#39;s crazy powerful!</p> <p>This great power comes at a little cost. To properly work, the <code>update</code> method (which receives <code>Message</code> and <code>&amp;mut App</code>) <strong>must be pure</strong>. It should not do any IO, like reading from a file. Instead, iced has a <code>Task</code> structure which the <code>update</code> method returns. Signature:</p> <p><code> fn update(&amp;mut App, Message) -&gt; Task </code></p> <p>Inside of this <code>Task</code> you are free to do whatever IO you want. But it <strong>must not</strong> happen directly inside of the <code>update</code>. Lets say your app wants to read from a file and store the contents.</p> <p>This is the, impure way to achieve that by directly reading in the <code>update</code> method:</p> <p>``` struct App { file_contents: String }</p> <p>enum Message { ReadFromFile(PathBuf), }</p> <p>fn update(app: &amp;mut App, message: Message) -&gt; Task {</p> <pre><code>match message { Message::ReadFromFile(file) =&gt; { let contents = fs::read_to_string(file); app.file_contents = contents; } } Task::none() </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>With the above, time-travelling will not work properly. Because when you re-play the sent <code>Message</code>, it will read from the file again. Who&#39;s contents could have changed in-between reads</p> <p>By moving the impure IO stuff into a <code>Task</code>, we fix the above problem:</p> <p>``` struct App { file_contents: String }</p> <p>enum Message { ReadFromFile(PathBuf),</p> <pre><code>UpdateFileContents(String) </code></pre> <p>}</p> <p>fn update(app: &amp;mut App, message: Message) -&gt; Task {</p> <pre><code>match message { Message::ReadFromFile(file) =&gt; { Task::future(async move { let contents = fs::read_to_string(file); // below message will be sent to the `update` Message::UpdateFileContents(contents) }) } Message::UpdateFileContents(contents) =&gt; { app.file_contents = contents; Task::none() } } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>Here, our timeline will include 2 <code>Message</code>s. Even if the contents of the file changes, the <code>Message</code> will not and we can now safely time-travel.</p> <p>What I&#39;d like to do, is enforce that the <code>update</code> method must be pure at compile time. It should be easy to do that in a pure language like elm or Haskell who has the IO monad. However, I don&#39;t think Rust can do this (I&#39;d love to be proven wrong).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nikitarevenco"> /u/nikitarevenco </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kh4hws/im_using_iced_for_my_screenshot_app_it_is_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kh4hws/im_using_iced_for_my_screenshot_app_it_is_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What the title says. Although Bazel&#39;s <code>rules_rust</code> covers a lot of pain-points that using a non-Cargo Rust project would&#39;ve had, one thing it doesn&#39;t have natively is support for running Miri for the project. Now it&#39;s important to point out that: - I&#39;m merely an intern at this company and I can&#39;t drive big architectural decisions, so I&#39;m just trying to improve what&#39;s already there. Bazel for Rust kinda sucks, but it is what it is. - It&#39;s not quite as easy as just creating an equivalent <code>Cargo.toml</code> for the <code>repos.bzl</code> in my project and run it, as a lot of our dependencies (internal) are also Bazel-based, and I&#39;d have to do the same for them (I&#39;m assuming).</p> <p>To give some more context, this is a bare-metal project being developed on x86 systems and then cross-compiled for RISC-V systems. I understand that Miri is a sort of a dynamic-analyzer, but I&#39;m not sure to what extent. Would it require actually running the code? So what would happen if the Miri command is run on my x86 machine though the code is built with RISC-V in mind? This project has a lot of <code>unsafe</code> code in it because of being bare-metal and needing to do some register or I/O read/writes. It&#39;d be really nice if I can get Miri working for us, it might catch a lot of bugs.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Master_Ad2532"> /u/Master_Ad2532 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kgxns1/how_to_get_miri_working_for_a_bazel_noncargo_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kgxns1/how_to_get_miri_working_for_a_bazel_noncargo_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have you ever wanted to interpret the arguments in a <code>format!</code> macro as something other than <code>Display::fmt</code> or <code>Debug::fmt</code>?</p> <p>...No?</p> <p>Anyway, this crate lets you do just that! More specifically, it lets you create your own <code>format!</code> like macros, which can decide how to interpret arguments and <code>&amp;str</code>s.</p> <p>As an example, here I have created a macro that takes arguments inside <code>{}</code> pairs, running them through the regular formatter, but will take arguments inside <code>&lt;&gt;</code> pairs as if they were comments on the string:</p> <pre><code>#![feature(decl_macro)] use format_like::format_like; #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] struct CommentedString(String, Vec&lt;(usize, String)&gt;); let comment = &quot;there is an error in this word&quot;; let text = &quot;text&quot;; let range = 0..usize::MAX; let commented_string = commented_string!( &quot;This is &lt;comment&gt;regluar {}, commented and interpolated {range.end}&quot;, text ); // The public macro which creates the CommentedString. pub macro commented_string($($parts:tt)*) { format_like!( parse_str, [(&#39;{&#39;, parse_fmt, false), (&#39;&lt;&#39;, parse_comment, true)], CommentedString(String::new(), Vec::new()), $($parts)* ) } macro parse_str($value:expr, $str:literal) {{ let mut commented_string = $value; commented_string.0.push_str($str); commented_string }} macro parse_fmt($value:expr, $modif:literal, $added:expr) {{ let CommentedString(string, comments) = $value; let string = format!(concat!(&quot;{}{&quot;, $modif, &quot;}&quot;), string, $added); CommentedString(string, comments) }} macro parse_comment($value:expr, $_modif:literal, $added:expr) {{ let mut commented_string = $value; commented_string.1.push((commented_string.0.len(), $added.to_string())); commented_string }} </code></pre> <p>In this example, you can see that this macro works by using three other macros within: <code>parse_str</code>, <code>parse_fmt</code> and <code>parse_comment</code>. This lets you decide exactly how these values will be parsed. In this case, the first one parses the parts of the <code>&amp;str</code> <em>not</em> inside delimiters, while the second and third handle the arguments in delimiters. This will all happen sequentially.</p> <p>In addition, you can use 4 types of delimiter: <code>{}</code>, <code>[]</code>, <code>()</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. These delimiters will be escaped when doubled, as per usual. Also in the example above, you can see that delimited parameters can also have variable member access, which is one of the small gripes that i have with the regular <code>format!</code> macros.</p> <p><strong>My usecase (you can skip this if you want)</strong></p> <p>Just like the last crate that I published here, I don&#39;t think many people will have much use for this crate tbh, but I do see one specific use that may show up once in a while: public facing widget APIs.</p> <p>In my case, the reason why I created this crate was because of the <code>text!</code> macro in my text editor <a href="https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat">Duat</a>. In it, you could create a sort of string with &quot;tags&quot;. Those tags can be used to change color, change alignment, hide text, add spacers, etc. This macro used to look like this:</p> <pre><code>let text = text!(&quot;start &quot; [RedColor.subvalue] fmt_1 Spacer into_text_var &quot; &quot;); </code></pre> <p>Here, you can see that it&#39;s arguments are just a sequence of things like literal <code>&amp;str</code>s, formatted values, some tags (like <code>Spacer</code>), and text styles (within <code>[]</code>).</p> <p>The main issue with this snipped is that the content of the macro really doesn&#39;t look like rust, and as such, automatic formatting was impossible, tree-sitter had no idea what it looked like, and variable separation was not clear at all.</p> <p>While I could just separate everything by commas, making it &quot;look like rust&quot;, that would then split it across a whole lot of lines, many of which would just have <code>&quot; &quot;,</code> inside, especially in the case of a status line widget.</p> <p>But after changing the macro to use <code>format-like</code>, the snippet now looks like this:</p> <pre><code>let text = text!(&quot;start [RedColor.subvalue]{fmt_1}{Spacer}{into_text_var} &quot;); </code></pre> <p>Not only is the variable separation clearer, but it even occupies less horizontal space than before, the only caveat is syntax highlighting by rust-analyzer, but since this is my own text editor, I&#39;ve solved that internally.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AhoyISki"> /u/AhoyISki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/AhoyISki/format-like">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kgv37l/create_arbitrary_format_like_macros_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Unfortunately, it struggles with large images and can be pretty unresponsive.</p> <p>My goal was to make a Rust tool that allows you to inspect an image of any size with all the features that you might expect from a tool like this like path/size filtering, convenient and easy-to-use UI, and fast startup times.</p> <p><code>xray</code> offers:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Vim motions support</strong></li> <li><strong>Small memory footprint</strong></li> <li><strong>Advanced path filtering</strong> with full RegEx support</li> <li><strong>Size-based filtering</strong> to quickly find space-consuming folders and files</li> <li><strong>Lightning-fast startup</strong> thanks to optimized image parsing</li> <li><strong>Clean, minimalistic UI</strong></li> <li><strong>Universal compatibility</strong> with any OCI-compliant container image</li> </ul> <p>Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/h33333333/xray">xray</a>.</p> <p>PRs are very much welcome!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! My name is Ron and I am the developer of a game called Letterlike (a roguelike word game that&#39;s been described as Balatro meets Scrabble). I wanted to share a little bit of my story in the off chance that anyone thought it was interesting! </p> <p><strong>This is a long one, but the summary is that I started coding in 2024 and eventually launched</strong> <strong>Letterlike</strong>, <strong>a word game that reached the top rankings in mobile and that just launched on Steam!</strong> </p> <p>At the beginning of 2024, after dealing with some personal issues, I realized that I needed to make some changes and began considering learning how to code. Other than taking a compsci course in high school decades ago, I had zero experience in coding and wasn&#39;t sure where to even start. I decided to go with the cheapest option to make sure I could even do it and took a few courses on Udemy that I bought on sale, including a really good course on React. </p> <p>During the course, there was a module where I was supposed to make my own project. There was this word game that I saw on a game show that looked really interesting that I couldn&#39;t find online so I decided to make that my project. The game eventually became my first game called Fix The Mix. It was a really simply word unscrambler but I thought it was fun. One of the very first iterations of the game is actually still hosted on Netlify!</p> <p>From there, after every module, I added more and more to the app from what I learned, and eventually came out with four other word games. I packaged it all into an app called Pocket Puzzles, which is currently available on the App Store and on the browser as well!</p> <p>I finished the course and Pocket Puzzles around Spring/Summer 2024 and was looking for my next App. I wasn&#39;t really thinking about making another game necessarily, and was open to other things. But then I downloaded Balatro and immediately realized how perfect this mechanic would be for a word game! I always loved roguelites and word games so it felt like the perfect match. I was so excited about this that I actually stopped playing Balatro after a round. Now looking back, I&#39;m kind of glad I did that because it allowed me to put my own personal taste on the game instead of trying to copy all of Balatro&#39;s systems. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t think React was going to be good enough so I immediately bought a course on Godot to see what I could do. But then I thought maybe I should try to make a prototype to make sure it&#39;s even doable and would be fun so I put together a quick working demo in a few weeks using React. I shared it with a couple of friends and got some really good feedback. </p> <p>I kept iterating in React with the idea that I would eventually move on to Godot, but I realized the game was kinda working so I kept building and building. It got to a point where I was having a lot of fun with it and I just kind of decided to launch it without much thought.</p> <p>I posted the game on the roguelites subreddit not thinking much about it, especially since Pocket Puzzles didn&#39;t get that much traction. But the response was crazy! People were really connecting with the game it seemed. I posted the game on the iosgaming subreddit shortly after, and it just sort of took off from there! Eventually over that weekend, the game reached #2 paid word games on the App Store and reached Top 15 of all paid games. </p> <p>So that&#39;s when I put a ton of work into the game (e.g., adding sound - yes the game launched without sound!). The next couple weeks were non-stop coding and coding, adding tons of features and fixing things based on all the feedback. And eventually launching on Android, where it currently sits as the #1 paid word game on the Play Store!</p> <p>And most recently, I launched the game on Steam last week! Throughout this whole journey, I had no idea anything about game developing and marketing and honestly, I&#39;m still learning! </p> <p>Anyway, that&#39;s pretty much it! This isn&#39;t really a postmoderm as I&#39;m still actively developing the game, but thought that was the most fitting tag. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RLeeSWriter"> /u/RLeeSWriter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kh3wwt/how_i_went_from_no_code_to_launching_a_game_thats/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kh3wwt/how_i_went_from_no_code_to_launching_a_game_thats/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I think it is up to about 10 minutes, and the only interaction I&#39;ve had is running right for about 3 seconds before another started playing.</p> <p>This got me thinking about a common pet peeve of mine: overly long cutscenes.</p> <p>Games are supposed to be an interactive medium, and cutscenes can be a fantastic tool to add amazement and push the story forward. </p> <p>But overly long cutscenes cause people to lose attention and just get annoyed or frustrated and start skipping things, which causes them to miss and lose interest in the story.</p> <p>In my opinion, about 3 minutes is the upper limit for cutscene length without gameplay, and ideally, most are less than 30 seconds. This also included blocks of dialog cutscenes too, not just the movie style.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello Gophers! üëã</p> <p>It‚Äôs been almost a week since my last update, so here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in the VarMQ. If you haven‚Äôt met <strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ</a></strong> yet, it‚Äôs a zero-dependency, hassle-free message queue designed for Go that gives you fine-grained control over concurrency and lets you swap in persistence or distribution layers through simple adapter interfaces. Until now, the only adapter available was redisq for Redis-backed queues. </p> <p>Today I am introducing <a href="https://github.com/goptics/sqliteq">sqliteq</a>, a brand-new adapter that brings lightweight SQLite persistence to VarMQ without any extra daemons or complex setup.</p> <p>With sqliteq, your jobs live in a local SQLite file‚Äîideal for small services. Integration feels just like <a href="https://github.com/goptics/redisq">redisq</a>: you create or open a SQLite-backed queue, bind it to a VarMQ worker, and then call <code>WithPersistentQueue</code> on your worker to start pulling and processing tasks from the database automatically. Under the hood nothing changes in your worker logic, but now every job is safely stored in the SQLite db.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs a quick example to give you the idea: ```go import &quot;github.com/goptics/sqliteq&quot;</p> <p>db := sqliteq.New(&quot;tasks.db&quot;) pq, _ := db.NewQueue(&quot;email_jobs&quot;)</p> <p>w := varmq.NewVoidWorker(func(data any) { // do work‚Ä¶ }, concurrency)</p> <p>q := w.WithPersistentQueue(pq) q.Add(&quot;&lt;your data&gt;&quot;) ```</p> <p>For more in-depth usage patterns and additional examples, head over to the <strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq/tree/main/examples">examples folder</a></strong>. I‚Äôd love to hear how you plan to use sqliteq, and what other adapters or features you‚Äôd find valuable. Let‚Äôs keep improving VarMQ together!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extension_Layer1825"> /u/Extension_Layer1825 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kh217g/sqliteq_the_lightweight_sqlite_queue_adapter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kh217g/sqliteq_the_lightweight_sqlite_queue_adapter/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m learning Go and coming from the Java with Spring Boot. I&#39;m trying to apply some Clean Architecture concepts I used in Java, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing it idiomatically in Go.</p> <p>In Java, I usually have something like this: <code> java-project/ ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ # models, interfaces, use cases (no frameworks) ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # interface implementations, REST API, JPA, etc. ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml # parent pom </code> Now, in Go, I&#39;m building something similar: <code> go-project/ ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ # models, interfaces, use cases ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # concrete repos, REST API, etc. ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code> But then I learned about workspaces, and I started wondering if it would be a good practice to use that concept to separate core and infrastructure: <code> go_project/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ go.work ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code> The idea would be to keep core free of external dependencies so it can be reused by infrastructure or even other microservices in the future. But I&#39;m not sure if this is commonly done in Go. I‚Äôd like to avoid using a weird or non-idiomatic structure.</p> <p>Advantages: Separation of dependencies between Core and Infrastructure. Core can be reused by other services or tools. Better isolation for testing and compilation. Better clean architecture. Cons: Increased complexity. Higher learning curve. More complex dependency viewing. Excessive in small projects.</p> <p>PS: Sorry for the wording, I used a tool to translate from Spanish to English.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GCrel"> /u/GCrel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kgvtgy/is_it_worth_using_workspaces_to_separate_core_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kgvtgy/is_it_worth_using_workspaces_to_separate_core_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kh9a15/first_rust_project_very_early_prototype_crate/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/shmup">Crate link</a> | <a href="https://github.com/IndieSmiths/shmup-rs">GitHub link</a></p> <p>I started learning and practicing Rust seriously last month. Previously I only used a bit of PHP and JS. Currently I&#39;m an open-source maintainer and use Python for my projects. I wanted to add Rust to my toolbelt as well because of the many interesting and critical problems it solves, so I set out to learn it. I don&#39;t learn new programming langs often, but when I do I think making games is a great way to do that, so I&#39;m making a small shmup using Rust + SDL2 and free game assets from Kenney.</p> <p>It is my first Rust project (beyond small tutorial stuff) and at a very early stage of development, so it is barely a prototype for now. So, please, keep that in mind. Even so, I&#39;m glad I could put something together that is capable of launching, managing some state and resources and displays a few interactions like shooting and hitting an enemy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KennedyRichard"> /u/KennedyRichard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://v.redd.it/csf7fuc9hfze1">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kh9a15/first_rust_project_very_early_prototype_crate/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
