            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, this is my first time posting on reddit even though I&#39;ve been an active browser for years. I&#39;ve been working in the video games industry for over 20 years at this point mostly as a technical artist and would just like to share some thoughts I&#39;ve had about the process of &quot;thinking&quot; as a technical artist that I&#39;ve had over that time. Just as a bit of a background, I originally started out as an artist in 2003 just after finishing the illustration program at the Ontario College of Art and Design. The first company I ever worked for was Brainbox Games where I helped ship a title named Land of the Dead : Road to Fiddler&#39;s Green.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Dead:_Road_to_Fiddler&#x27;s_Green">Wikipedia - Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler&#39;s Green</a></p> <p>Notable fact, we got the worst game of the year :) ...so yeah, I guess that&#39;s something. Despite that, I&#39;m still really fond of it and the work that I did on it. Because it was a small team I was given the opportunity to take on multiple roles. I worked on character modeling, texturing, rigging and also produced all the animations and sound effects. Another fun fact is I voiced the male zombie in the game. I really think the benefit of doing multiple roles in the production of the data (content) for the game is that I was able to see at different points in the production of the data that these things were connected and had dependencies on one another. Some examples would be how the mesh topology for the zombie models would directly impact how well the model could be deformed by the skeleton after it had been rigged and animated or that the skeleton needed specific bones in it for the animation system in code to interact with. I feel going into the technical details of that game could be a fun article for another time.</p> <p>Even though I started out as an artist, gradually over time I continued to gravitate to more technical aspects of video game development. Moving from what I did at Brainbox, to working in environments and level design where I was exposed to more scripting and then onto working with scripting languages like python in software like Blender until I eventually ended up as a tools programmer for a while where I was basically fully exposed to just programming. So in short I went from being an illustrator to a programmer. I went from constructing ideas and concepts visually to constructing them with logic in computers.</p> <p>After working in the industry for so many years and going from one side to the other, you realize that the two different sides of art and design and the software engineering side of things speak very different languages. Artists will talk about composition, values and colors while programmers will talk about the morphologies of the languages they use to talk to system APIs in computers. Despite that though, there is a through line that connects these two domains at opposite ends of one another. <strong>This is where the primary job of the technical artists comes in. It‚Äôs understanding that line (or spectrum) so that you can go-between the two domains and translate between those languages to help others on the opposite side understand one another.</strong></p> <p>For this post I would like to talk about what I think of as the ‚Äú<strong>The Spectrum of Technical Art</strong>‚Äù. It‚Äôs basically how I think there is a common denominator from the art side to the code side in that they both use technical (technology) means to realize ideas and concepts that are internalized in your mind and heart. They both use a form of technology to construct a model of a world that can be shared with others.</p> <p>When you think about how you actually make a painting or a drawing, you are still using a form of technology like using a paintbrush to apply paint to a canvas. These items, although much earlier in time, are a form of technology and you have to have a ‚Äútechnical‚Äù understanding of how to use that technology to be able to bring out your internalized concepts and realize them in some medium that will persist them in some physical form, like the paint on the canvas. Likewise, this is the same for the opposite end of the spectrum where data and code resides for different types of software like apps on your phone or video games on your PC. You have to have a diverse and deep technical understanding of many different domains to be able to construct a world in the digital medium, such is done for video games. I‚Äôll also add, digital is also physical, the data and code still has to be persisted in a physical form such as the platters of your hard drive or the silicon of your system memory.</p> <p>So in short, I think there is a spectrum from the applied visual arts to software engineering in that they both require the technical understanding of how to use a technology to actualize internalized ideas and concepts. As you travel along this spectrum, from one end to the other, the degree of understanding complex technology gradually ramps up. <strong>One of the jobs of a technical artist is understanding how far they need to travel along it to realize what they‚Äôre trying to build.</strong></p> <p>Another thing that is interesting about this spectrum, is that as you travel to the other end, the complexity and vividness of the imagined worlds you construct increases.</p> <p>Anyway, I‚Äôm just trying to put some thoughts down in written form. I hope somebody finds them interesting. I think I would like to turn these ideas into more full articles with images. Hopefully somebody will find these thoughts useful. Let me know what you think.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jaredsmithketchup123"> /u/jaredsmithketchup123 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jvmipf/how_to_think_like_a_technical_artist_the_spectrum/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jvmipf/how_to_think_like_a_technical_artist_the_spectrum/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The simulation layer then brings the world to life as inhabitants begin to interact, evolve, and shape their stories.</p> <p><strong>The core loop is about creative freedom ‚Äî the management and simulation elements are the icing on the cake.</strong></p> <h1>Launch Highlights</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Steam Page Live:</strong> April 6,7, 2025 (it was online a few hours before april 7th)</li> <li><strong>Wishlists milestone:</strong> around1,000 wishlists within the first 2 days</li> <li><strong>Languages Supported:</strong> English, German, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, French, Russian, Turkish (with plans to expand further)</li> <li><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> The well-known Japanese site <strong>4Gamer</strong> published a feature on the game, bringing in early international attention, especially from Japanese players</li> <li><strong>Reddit virality</strong>: frequent dev updates on Reddit (<a href="/r/godot">r/godot</a>) reached over 1 million views combined, helping build pre-launch momentum</li> </ul> <h1>Community &amp; Press</h1> <p>I leaned heavily on Reddit, Twitter (X), and developer communities (particularly within the Godot ecosystem) to build awareness. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive ‚Äî especially around the procedural world generation, editor freedom, and overall concept as a kind of ‚Äúsandbox god sim meets MMO theme park.‚Äù</p> <p>Japanese players in particular responded to the 4Gamer article with enthusiasm, comparing the game to TRPG-style worldbuilding and Dungeon Master tools.</p> <h1>‚úÖ What Went Well</h1> <ul> <li>Strong community support pre-launch through devlog posts and Reddit interaction</li> <li>Localization-ready Steam page in 7 major languages helped expand wishlist diversity</li> <li>Press hit from 4Gamer gave us credibility in the Japanese market</li> <li>Quick growth to 1,000+ wishlists thanks to Reddit virality and Discord engagement</li> <li>Clear messaging on the creative focus: Players understood the &quot;build/design first, simulate second&quot; concept</li> </ul> <h1>‚ùå What Could Be Improved</h1> <ul> <li>No Trailer uploaded, as i am struggling with actually making a good one</li> <li>The Steampage needs to showcase more gameplay mechanics from player perspective</li> <li>No Western media pickup (yet): While 4Gamer covered the game, no major English-speaking outlets (e.g. IGN, PC Gamer) have picked it up so far</li> </ul> <h1>Next Steps</h1> <ul> <li>Finalize press kits and continue pitching smaller/medium-sized gaming sites ‚Äî especially in the top 15 Steam languages</li> <li>Reach out to YouTubers and streamers with a demo preview build</li> <li>Prepare for inclusion in a Steam Next Fest or other event</li> <li>Continue refining UI/UX and communicating core gameplay in visual form</li> <li>Expand Discord &amp; community-building efforts</li> </ul> <p>Huge thanks to everyone who has followed the game so far, added it to their wishlist, or gave feedback along the way. The response from the global community ‚Äî across Reddit, Steam, and even Japan ‚Äî has been incredibly motivating. This is just the beginning of what Fantasy World Manager can become.</p> <p>thank you!</p> <p>‚Äî</p> <p>Florian Alushaj<br/> Solo Developer ‚Äì Fantasy World Manager</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768"> /u/Hot-Persimmon-9768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jvbazl/my_steam_page_launch_surpised_me_beyond_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jvbazl/my_steam_page_launch_surpised_me_beyond_my/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m currently diving into GUI development with Rust and, honestly, I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed by the number of options out there‚Äî<code>egui</code>, <code>iced</code>, <code>splint</code>, <code>tauri</code>, and others. They all seem to have their strengths, but it‚Äôs hard to make a decision because they all have roughly the same amount of reviews and stars, and I don‚Äôt have the time to experiment with each one to figure out which is <em>really</em> the best fit for me.</p> <p>So, I wanted to ask the community: why did you choose the Rust GUI library you‚Äôre currently using?</p> <ul> <li><strong>What were the main criteria that led you to your choice?</strong></li> <li><strong>Are there small features or details that made one library feel more comfortable or intuitive than others?</strong> Maybe it&#39;s a specific API design, or a feature that‚Äôs really helped you get your project off the ground.</li> <li><strong>What kind of project are you working on, and why did you pick the library you did?</strong> What made you feel like <code>egui</code> or <code>iced</code> (or whatever you‚Äôre using) was the best fit for your use case over the others?</li> </ul> <p>It feels like, with web development, the decision is pretty easy‚ÄîReact is a go-to choice and many libraries are built on top of it. But with Rust GUI options, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a clear &quot;best&quot; option, at least not one that stands out above the others in a way that&#39;s easy to decide. It&#39;s hard to find that &quot;killer feature&quot; when each library seems to offer something unique, and with limited time to test them, I feel a little stuck.</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences! Looking forward to hearing why you made your choice and how it&#39;s worked out so far.</p> <p><em>Also, I just want to vent a bit about something that&#39;s been driving me crazy. Right now, I‚Äôm stuck trying to center a button with content below it at the center of the screen. In React, I could easily do that with MUI, but here, in Rust, I have no clue how to do it. I‚Äôve tried using something like centered_and_justified, and while it seems to work in making the content fill 100% width and height (as the documentation says), I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how to actually center my content.</em></p> <p><em>This is honestly the main reason I decided to post here‚Äîam I sure egui is the right tool for my project?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><code>pprof</code> is an amazing tool for debugging memory leaks, but what about when it&#39;s not enough? Read about how we used <code>gcore</code> and <code>viewcore</code> to hunt a particularly nasty memory leak in a large distributed system.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> We&#39;ve reproduced our blog so folks can read its entirety on Reddit, but if you want to go to our website to read it there and see screenshots and architecture diagrams (since those can&#39;t be posted in this subreddit), you can access it here: <a href="https://www.warpstream.com/blog/a-trip-down-memory-lane-how-we-resolved-a-memory-leak-when-pprof-failed-us">https://www.warpstream.com/blog/a-trip-down-memory-lane-how-we-resolved-a-memory-leak-when-pprof-failed-us</a></p> <h1>Backstory</h1> <p>A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that the HeapInUse metric reported by the Go runtime, which tracks the number of in-use bytes on the heap, looked like the following for the WarpStream control plane:</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67edd25ce24b85e0583a3937_AD_4nXe56vzeVniqYwc3cubTGdYD2aALVqLAoYBqH-5nEvFdHenTwuXUG39RjFY6pojgwUoqdr-MAtEkpnSxHijdkxd337m8HBuYZAvwFfv1OLIbeGXhqDl4kjBWDU4d-s5Vq2bM1wOvZg.png">Figure 1: The HeapInUse metric for the control plane showed signs of a memory leak.</a></p> <p>This was alarming, as the linear increase strongly indicates a memory leak. The leak was very slow, and our control planes are deployed almost daily (sometimes multiple times per day), so while the memory leak didn‚Äôt represent an immediate issue, we wanted to get to the bottom of it.</p> <h1>Initial Approach</h1> <p>The WarpStream control plane is written in Go, which has excellent built-in support for debugging application memory issues with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof">pprof</a>. We‚Äôve used <code>pprof</code> hundreds of times in the past to debug performance issues, and usually memory leaks are particularly easy to spot. </p> <p>The <code>pprof</code> heap profiles can be used to see which objects are still ‚Äúlive‚Äù on the heap as of the latest garbage collection run, so figuring out the source of a memory leak is usually as simple as grabbing a couple of heap profiles at different points in time. The differences in the memory occupied by live objects will explain the leak.</p> <p>As expected, comparing heap profiles taken at different times showed something very suspicious:</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67eed32251071fce1c12f36b_Frame%201%20(3">Figure 2: Comparing profiles showed a significant increase in the size of the live compaction jobs.</a>.png)</p> <p>The profile on the right, which was taken later, showed that the size of the live FileMetadata objects created by the compaction scheduler almost doubled! To understand what the profile is telling us here, we have to get into WarpStream‚Äôs job scheduling framework briefly.</p> <h1>Job Scheduling in WarpStream</h1> <p>For a WarpStream cluster to function efficiently, a few background jobs need to run regularly. An example of such a job is the <a href="https://docs.warpstream.com/warpstream/overview/architecture/write-path#file-compaction">compaction jobs</a> that periodically rewrite and merge the data files in object storage. These jobs run in the Agent, but are scheduled by the control plane. </p> <p>To orchestrate these jobs, a polling model is used as shown in Figure 3 below. The control plane maintains a job queue to which the various job schedulers submit jobs. The Agent will periodically poll the control plane for outstanding jobs to run, and once a job is completed, an acknowledgement is sent back to the control plane, allowing the control plane to remove the specified job from the queue. Additionally, the control plane regularly scans the jobs in the job queue to remove jobs it considers timed out, preventing queue buildup.</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67eec600abf7e6b2a1be4641_Group%20538%20(3">Figure 3: In this high-level overview of WarpStream‚Äôs job scheduling framework, jobs are submitted by the various job schedulers into a job queue. The Agent polls from the queue, runs the returned job, and informs the control plane of the job‚Äôs completion or failure.</a>.png)</p> <h1>Understanding the Leak</h1> <p>Knowing how job scheduling works, it was surprising to see the FileMetadata objects being highlighted in the heap profiles. These objects, serving as inputs for the compaction jobs, have a pretty deterministic lifecycle: they should be removed from the queue and eventually garbage collected as compaction jobs complete or time out.</p> <p>So, how can we explain the increased memory usage due to these FileMetadata objects? We had two hypotheses:</p> <ol> <li>The queue size was growing.</li> <li>The queue was unintentionally retaining references to the jobs.</li> </ol> <p>With our logs and metrics, the first hypothesis was ruled out. To confirm the second one, we carefully went through the job queue code, spotted and fixed a potential source of leak, and yet the fix did not stop the leak. Much of this relied on our familiarity with the codebase, so even when we thought we had a fix, there was no concrete proof.</p> <p>We were stumped. We set out thinking that profiling would provide all the answers, but were left perplexed. With no remaining hypothesis to validate, we had to revisit the fundamentals.</p> <h1>Garbage Collection Internals</h1> <p>The Go runtime comes with a <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide">garbage collector (GC)</a> and most of the time we don‚Äôt have to think about how it works, until we need to understand why a certain object is being retained. The fact that the FileMetadata objects showed up in the in-use space view of the heap profiles means that the GC still considered them live. But what does that mean?</p> <p>The Go GC employs the mark-sweep algorithm, meaning its cycles include a mark phase and a sweep phase. The mark phase figures out if an object is reachable and the sweep phase reclaims the unreachable objects determined from the mark phase. </p> <p>To figure out whether an object is reachable, the GC has to traverse the object graph starting from the GC roots marking objects referenced by reachable objects as reachable. The complete list of GC roots can be found below, but examples include global variables and live <code>goroutine</code> stacks.</p> <pre><code>func markroot(gcw *gcWork, rootIndex uint32) { switch getRootType(rootIndex): case DATA_SEGMENT: markGlobalVariables(gcw, rootIndex) case BSS_SEGMENT: markGlobalVariables(gcw, rootIndex) case FINALIZER: scanFinalizers(gcw) case DEAD_GOROUTINE_STACK: freeDeadGoroutineStacks(gcw) case SPAN_WITH_SPECIALS: scanSpansWithSpecials(gcw, rootIndex) default: scanGoroutineStacks(gcw, rootIndex) } </code></pre> <p>Figure 4: Pseudocode based on the Go GC‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/mgcmark.go#L150-L256">logic</a> showing the mark phase starting from the GC roots.</p> <p>That means that for the <code>FileMetadata</code> objects to be retained, they must be traceable back to some GC root. The question then became: could we figure out the precise chain of object references leading to the <code>FileMetadata</code> objects? Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt something that pprof could help with.</p> <h1>Core Dumps to the Rescue</h1> <p>The heap profiles were very effective at telling us the <em>allocation</em> sites of live objects, but provided no insights into why specific objects were being <em>retained</em>. Getting the GC roots of these objects would be crucial for understanding the leak. </p> <p>For that, we used <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/gcore-man.html">gcore</a> from gdb to take a core dump of the control plane process in our staging environment by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>gcore &lt;pid&gt; </code></pre> <p>However, raw core dumps can be notoriously difficult to interpret. While the snapshot of the heap from the core dump tells us about object relationships, understanding what those objects <em>mean</em> in the context of our application is a whole other challenge. So, we turned to <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/debug/cmd/viewcore">viewcore</a> for analysis, as it enriches the core dump with <a href="https://dwarfstd.org/">DWARF</a> debugging information and provides handy utilities for exploring the state of the dumped process.</p> <p>We ran the following commands to see the live <code>FileMetadata</code> objects along with their virtual addresses:</p> <pre><code>viewcore &lt;corefile&gt; objects &gt; objs.txt cat objs.txt | grep streampb.FileMetadata </code></pre> <p>The resulting output looked like this:</p> <pre><code>c097bc8000 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc8140 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc8280 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9680 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc97c0 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9900 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9a40 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9b80 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9cc0 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bc9e00 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bd0000 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bd0140 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata c097bd0280 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata </code></pre> <p>Figure 5: A sample of the live <code>FileMetadata</code> objects that viewcore showed from the core dump.</p> <p>To get the GC root information for a given object, we ran:</p> <pre><code>viewcore &lt;corefile&gt; reachable &lt;address&gt; </code></pre> <p>That gave us the chain of references shown below:</p> <pre><code>(viewcore) reachable c028dba000 githuburl/pkg/deadscanner.(*Scheduler).RunAsync.GoWithRecover.func3 githuburl/pkg/deadscanner.(*Scheduler).RunAsync.func1 githuburl/pkg/deadscanner.(*Scheduler).scheduleJobsLoop.s ‚Üí c0148e7b00 githuburl/pkg/deadscanner.Scheduler .queue.data ‚Üí c00dc67680 githuburl/pkg/jobs.backoffJobQueue .queue.data ‚Üí c002e45f00 githuburl/pkg/jobs.balancedJobQueue .queue.data ‚Üí c00294a930 githuburl/pkg/jobs.multiPriorityJobQueue .queuesInOrder.ptr ‚Üí c002714eb8 [3]*githuburl/pkg/jobs.pq [0] -&gt; c0029518c0 githuburl/pkg/jobs.pq.q‚Üí c00dc67380 githuburl/pkg/jobs.jobQueue .queues ‚Üí c00d67320 githuburl/pkg/jobs.jobTypeQueues ._queuesByType ‚Üí c00294a6f0 hash&lt;githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/agentpoolpb.JobType,*githuburl/pkg/jobs.jobTypeQueue&gt;.buckets ‚Üí c0303464d0 bucket&lt;githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/agentpoolpb.JobType,*githuburl/pkg/jobs.jobTypeQueue&gt; .values[1] ‚Üí c010c40180 githuburl/pkg/jobs.jobTypeQueue .inflight ‚Üí c002717830 hash&lt;string,githuburl/pkg/jobs.inflightEntry&gt; .buckets ‚Üí c0437ec000 [33+4?]bucket&lt;string,githuburl/pkg/jobs.inflightEntry&gt; [0].values[0].onAck ‚Üí fO c026225dc0 unk112 f56 ‚Üí c02fb58f00 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/agentpoolpb.JobInput .CompactionJob ‚Üí c028dbba40 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/agentpoolpb.CompactionJobInput .Files.ptr -&gt; c027ea9b00 [32]*githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata [11] ‚Üí c028dba000 githuburl/pkg/stream/pb/streampb.FileMetadata </code></pre> <p>Figure 6: The precise chain of references from a <code>FileMetadata</code> object to a GC root.</p> <h1>Root Causing the Leak</h1> <p>Now this chain of references from the core dump revealed something less obvious. That is, these <code>FileMetadata</code> objects, which we said were created by the <em>compaction</em> scheduler, were retained by the <em>deadscanner</em> scheduler, which is used to scan and remove files in the object store that are no longer tracked by the control plane.</p> <p>This gave us another angle to consider: how could the deadscanner scheduler possibly be retaining jobs that it did not create? As revealed by the object relationship from Figure 6 and the diagram from Figure 3, the compaction and deadscanner schedulers share a reference to the same job queue. Consequently, the fact that a compaction job is not retained by the compaction scheduler, and rather the deadscanner scheduler, implies that the compaction scheduler had terminated already, while the deadscanner scheduler continued to run. </p> <p>This behavior was unexpected. All job schedulers for a virtual cluster are bundled into a single computational unit called an actor, and the actor dictates the lifecycle of its internal components. Consequently, the various schedulers shut down if and only if the job actor shuts down. At least, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work!</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67eec22d58548dfd2b871ef0_Group%20539%20(1">Figure 7: The WarpStream control plane is multi-tenant. The job actors for different virtual clusters are distributed among the control plane replicas.</a>.png)</p> <p>That information narrowed down the scope of the search, and upon investigation, we discovered that the memory leak could be attributed to a goroutine leak in the deadscanner scheduler. The important code snippet is reproduced below: </p> <pre><code>func (s *Scheduler) RunAsync(ctx context.Context) { go s.scheduleJobsLoop(ctx) } func (s *Scheduler) scheduleJobsLoop(ctx context.Context) { t := time.NewTicker(s.config.Interval) defer t.Stop() for { select { case &lt;-ctx.Done(): return case &lt;-t.C: if err := s.runOnce(ctx); err != nil { s.logger.Error(&quot;run_failure&quot;, err) } } } } func (s *Scheduler) runOnce(ctx context.Context) error { ctx, cc := context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Hour) defer cc() jobInput := createJobInput() for { outcome, err := s.queue.Submit(ctx, jobInput) if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(&quot;error submitting job: %w&quot;, err) } if outcome.Success() { break } if outcome.Backoff { break } if outcome.Backpressured { // Queue is currently full, retry the submission. } time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) } return nil } </code></pre> <p>The scheduler runs in background and periodically schedules jobs for the Agents to execute. These jobs are submitted to a queue, and we block on job submission until one of the terminating conditions is met. The rationale is simple: if the queue is full at the time of the submission, the scheduler will wait for inflight jobs to complete and queue slots to become available. </p> <p>And that precisely was the cause of the leak. When a job actor is shutting down, it signals to the contained job schedulers that a shutdown is in progress by canceling the context passed to the RunAsync function.</p> <p>However, there is a catch. If the deadscanner scheduler is busy spinning inside the for loop in runOnce due to a back-pressured signal indicating a full queue at the time of the context cancellation, it will not be aware of the cancellation! What is worse is that during job actor shutdown, the queue will most likely be full because the queue will not be serving poll requests from the Agents anymore, and the outstanding jobs will remain, causing job submission to be backpressure continuously, and the goroutine from the deadscanner scheduler to be stuck.</p> <p>The fix was simple. All we needed to do was to make the job queue submission function check for context cancellation before doing anything else. The deadscanner scheduler will see the job submission error due to an invalid context, break from the loop form <code>runOnce</code>, and shut down properly.</p> <pre><code>func (j *jobQueue) submit ( ctx context.Context, jobInput JobInput, ) (JobOutcome, error) { if ctxErr := ctx.Err(); ctxErr != nil { return JobOutcome{}, ctxErr } // Continue with job submission. ... } </code></pre> <p>Figure 8. The replicated patch to the job queue that returns an error for job submissions with a canceled context.</p> <p>At this point one might start to wonder when the job actor gets shut down. If this only happened during control plane shutdowns, the effects would have been benign. The reality is more complex. The control plane explicitly shuts down job actors in the following scenarios:</p> <ol> <li>A virtual cluster becomes idle.</li> <li>A job actor is being migrated to another control plane replica to avoid hotspotting.</li> </ol> <p>Consider a scenario where a tenant disconnects all their Agents from the control plane. This corresponds to the first case: if a cluster is no longer receiving poll job requests, then the job actor can be purged to free up resources. Scenario 2 is related to the multi-tenant nature of the control plane. </p> <p>As shown in Figure 7, every virtual cluster gets its own job actor for isolation, and the various job actors are distributed among the control plane replicas. To avoid overloading individual replicas with memory-intensive job actors, the control plane periodically assesses the memory usage of the replicas. When significant imbalances are detected, it redistributes actors by shutting down an actor on the replica with the highest memory usage and re-spawning it on the replica with the lowest usage. The combination of these two factors led to more frequent and yet less predictable memory leak occurrences.</p> <p>To confirm that we had the right fix, we deployed the patch and monitored the <code>HeapInUse</code> metric shown previously in Figure 1. This time, the metric looked a lot healthier:</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67edd25b970feef67b947fc5_AD_4nXdwZbBdPxqWDf8S3oDAVWOT7rNR8slNf22ERwsaeSW3mcqJOydCbd8hsvxdcVfgBCO7uOY5fEwlXD4sS4ZRH9bCBf_Z91W1uNJV6rkpMdIkOh4EOqDYfS1akD7morTAbD69dB14.png">Figure 9: The HeapInUse metric for the control plane no longer showed a linear increase after the patch was deployed</a></p> <h1>Final Thoughts</h1> <p>The cause of a memory leak is always more obvious in retrospect. The investigation took several twists and turns before we arrived at the correct solution. So we wondered: could we have approached this more effectively? Since we now know that the root cause was a goroutine leak, we should have been able to rely on the goroutine profiles to uncover the problem.</p> <p>It turned out that sometimes the global picture is not very telling. When comparing two profiles showing all goroutines, the leak was not very obvious to the human eye</p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67edd25cca97fe364bdc1c51_AD_4nXf-nw1iMvuQ2cziHn5MtMD9V_6hscZLkUqlGTozTMdmGGvOiQuMLvxVMh-0sHjKfI1s8IZgiDc8NOdU03z6SEeO1A5uL7nHFMz4Jt2J12glDlvkqJTi8QK1A6CTcsqFOP5Q4Wsimw.png">Figure 10: A comparison of goroutine profiles for the same period as in Figure 2 showed no significant differences.</a></p> <p>However, when we zoomed in on the offending deadscanner package, a more significant change was revealed: </p> <p><a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64baaecd9c5c9b1b6c38aa0e/67eec9b72f12437323cc197c_asd.png">Figure 11: A comparison of goroutine profiles for the same period as in Figure 2 showed no significant differences.</a></p> <p>The art of debugging complex systems is simultaneously holding both the system-wide perspective and the microscopic view, and knowing and using the right tools at each level of detail. As we have seen, seemingly subtle changes can have a significant impact on a global level. </p> <p>The debugging journey often begins with examining global trends using diagnostic tools like profiling. However, when those observations are inconclusive, isolating the data by specific dimensions can also be beneficial. While the selection of these dimensions might involve some trial and error, the results can still be very insightful. And as a last resort, reverting to the lowest-level tools is always a viable option.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/warpstream_official"> /u/warpstream_official </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jv7jdv/a_trip_down_memory_lane_how_we_resolved_a_memory/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jv7jdv/a_trip_down_memory_lane_how_we_resolved_a_memory/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The idea is to keep it super lightweight and simple, so performance overhead stays minimal.</p> <p>Yeah, I know not everyone‚Äôs into these kinds of abstractions‚Äîsome of you love writing your own ops from scratch.

There <em>is</em> an old PR trying to add generics, but it just tacks on more methods instead of simplifying things.</p> <p>My goal is to start fresh, take advantage of Go‚Äôs generics, and keep the API clean and minimal‚Äînot bloated with 3 versions of every function.

Similarly, I have never developed a game using any game engine before. However, after doing some research, I realized that I have a strong interest in computer graphics, game development, and even building game engines.</p> <p>After realizing this interest, I started studying mathematics to support my learning. Right now, I want to pursue this field as a hobby, but I also want to learn it properly and from scratch.</p> <p>Starting with Rust and WGPU seems like a reasonable path to me. However, I am not sure if this is the right choice for my current skill level. I am curious about how difficult this path would be, what challenges I might face, and what kind of learning path I should follow.</p> <p>My first goal is to understand the concepts step by step and eventually create my own voxel-based game. I really want to achieve this.</p> <p>Some people suggested starting with C++ and OpenGL instead, saying that it is a good foundation for those who are new to graphics programming. Still, I wanted to get your opinions. Do you think it makes sense to start with Rust + WGPU, or would it be better to build a different foundation first?</p> <p>Finally, I have one more question: How much math do I really need to know for this? Should I learn all the basic math concepts from scratch, or is it enough to just learn what I need?
