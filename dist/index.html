Yeah, I got tired of that. So I made a tool.</p> <p>the desktop app that lets you import messages, images, and media from Discord (via a discord bot you create), arrange them nicely, style them to your liking, and export them as clean showcase pieces. It‚Äôs simple, fast, and designed to make Discord content look professional with minimal effort.</p> <p>It‚Äôs made using <strong>Tauri</strong> (so it‚Äôs lightweight and fast) with a <strong>React (Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion) + TypeScript</strong> frontend. Works across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).</p> <h1>Why I built it?</h1> <p>I originally built this app for a streamer who wanted a better way to present Discord messages on stream and in highlight videos. Screenshots were always messy, cropping took too long. I liked the idea so i decided to release the app as open source.</p> <p>It‚Äôs still a work in progress, but it‚Äôs very much usable, so feedback and ideas are welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Megalith01"> /u/Megalith01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1leqs1m/i_built_an_app_to_turn_discord_messages_into/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1leqs1m/i_built_an_app_to_turn_discord_messages_into/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/VincentVerdynanta/utsuru">https://github.com/VincentVerdynanta/utsuru</a></p> <p>Hello fellow Rustaceans! I would like to see if there is any interest in this small project that I just built.</p> <p>utsuru is a WebRTC utility that you can use to &quot;Go Live&quot; on Discord using OBS, FFmpeg, or anything that supports WHIP. It also allows you to add more than one Discord call, meaning you can simultaneously broadcast the stream coming from OBS to multiple Discord calls.</p> <p>This project started with my ambition to get more familiar with WebRTC.</p> <p>From my observation, WebRTC is a protocol that is almost exclusively used for web app projects. At that time, I didn‚Äôt feel like making another broadcasting or video conferencing platform, so I put my ambition on hold.</p> <p>Sometime later, I encountered a personal frustration while using Discord, particularly due to the lack of granular control over streams. I found it difficult to &quot;Go Live&quot; a specific application with system audio, or vice versa. I wished there was a way to use some kind of compositor to customize the layout of the video and audio I wanted to stream. That‚Äôs when OBS came to mind.</p> <p>I discovered that I could use the &quot;Windowed Projector&quot; feature in OBS. With this, I could set Discord to &quot;Go Live&quot; a specific application and stream that OBS window. However, I felt that this solution wasn‚Äôt elegant.</p> <p>I then decided to search for GitHub projects related to Discord and streaming, hoping to find something that would give me exactly what I was looking for. I came across the <a href="https://github.com/Discord-RE/Discord-video-stream">Discord-video-stream</a> project. While it didn‚Äôt provide the exact solution, it was close. With Discord-video-stream, I could stream local or buffered files.</p> <p>However, before diving deeper into this project, I noticed a line in the project‚Äôs README that caught my attention:</p> <blockquote> <p>For better stability it is recommended to use WebRTC protocol instead since Discord is forced to adhere to spec, which means that the non-signaling portion of the code is guaranteed to work.</p> </blockquote> <p>This line reminded me of WebRTC and reignited my initial ambition.</p> <p>The Discord-video-stream project was implemented using Discord‚Äôs custom UDP protocol, accepting input in the form of a file, which it transcodes using FFmpeg before sending it to Discord. I figured that I could learn WebRTC by building a similar tool, but one that uses the standard WebRTC protocol, accepts input directly from OBS, and sends it to Discord without the need for transcoding.</p> <p>I then went to see whether OBS supported streaming through the WebRTC protocol. It turns out that it does, and the terminology for it is called WHIP. I also found that I preferred the tool to be packaged as a single executable file, making distribution and deployment as simple as possible. Therefore, I decided to develop the tool in Rust, as it is the compiled language I am most comfortable writing with.</p> <p>Thanks for checking out utsuru! I&#39;d love to hear what you think.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lVincentl"> /u/lVincentl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lekud7/utsuru_go_live_simultaneously_on_multiple_discord/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lekud7/utsuru_go_live_simultaneously_on_multiple_discord/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I have recently been learning Go after coming from learning some C before that, and mainly using Python, bash etc. for work. I make this post in the hope that someone also learning Go who might encounter this conceptual barrier I had might benefit.</p> <p>I was struggling with wrapping my head around the concept of interfaces. I understood that any struct can implement an interface as long as it has all the methods that the interface has, then you can pass that interface to a function.</p> <p>What I didn&#39;t know was that if a function is expecting an interface, that basically means that it is expecting a type that implements an interface. Since an interface is just a signature of a number of different methods, you can also pass in a different interface to that function as long as it still implements all those methods expected in the function argument. </p> <p>Found that out the hard way while trying to figure out how on earth an interface of type <code>net.Conn</code> could still be accepted as an argument to the <code>bufio.NewReader()</code> method. Here is some code I wrote to explain (to myself in the future) what I learned.</p> <p>For those more experienced, please correct or add to anything that I&#39;ve said here as again I&#39;m quite new to Go.</p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; ) type One interface { PrintMe() } type Two interface { // Notice this interface has an extra method PrintMe() PrintMeAgain() } func IExpectOne(i One) { // Notice this function expects an interface of type &#39;One&#39; // However, we can also pass in interface of type &#39;Two&#39; because // implicitly, it contains all the methods of interface type &#39;One&#39; i.PrintMe() } func IExpectTwo(ii Two) { // THis function will work on any interface, not even explicitly one of type &#39;Two&#39; // so long as it implements all of the &#39;Two&#39; methods (PrintMe(), PrintMeAgain()) ii.PrintMe() ii.PrintMeAgain() } type OneStruct struct { t string } type TwoStruct struct { t string } func (s OneStruct) PrintMe() { fmt.Println(s.t) } func (s TwoStruct) PrintMe() { fmt.Println(s.t) } func (s TwoStruct) PrintMeAgain() { fmt.Println(s.t) } func main() { fmt.Println() fmt.Println(&quot;----Interfaces 2----&quot;) one := OneStruct{&quot;Hello&quot;} two := TwoStruct{&quot;goodbye&quot;} oneI := One(one) twoI := Two(two) IExpectOne(oneI) IExpectOne(twoI) // Still works!
