But have some experience in JS and python which I picked up by building shit that works atleast most of the time.</p> <p>I decided to learn Golang. I did coding exercies on a website called exercism. I have gotten the understanding of basic syntax atleast. I have built a simple wails app. I have ported some of my python stuff to go.</p> <p>Due to my profession, I work a lot with pdfs. I use ghostscript and qpdf from cli to work with them. I thought maybe If I build a graphical interface using Wails to interact with Ghostscript and qpdf using OS.Exec, it will be great learning exercise and a good tool for personal use.</p> <p>As, I started to chart out the things I wanna implement and how I wanna implement, being new to golang itself and lacking understanding of nuances, I keep getting so many doubts in mind regarding various things.</p> <p>So my thoughts are as below:</p> <p><code>- JobManager Package (Custom made): It works as a bridge between frontend and actual pdf toolkit. It will receive requests to start a pdf operation. Store that in memory. Validate inputpath and other parameters. After that it will pass the parameters, a</code> <strong>new context for that particular job</strong> <code>and</code> <em>a pipe function</em> <code>to read and store shell output and allow frontend to get information about job or cancel it using &quot;</code><strong>context for that particular job</strong><code>&quot;</code></p> <p><code>- PDfuck package (Custom made): Actual Wrapper for qpdf and ghostscript. Receives &quot;</code><strong>particular job context</strong><code>&quot;, input parameters and a</code> <em>pipe function</em> <code>to get shell output to Jobmanager.</code></p> <p><code>- App.go (Required file for Wails app creating main app context): I will create a new JobManager instance, give it a contextWithCancel and expose the JobManager instance to frontend.</code></p> <p>Now, I am not sure, if the PDfuck package should run operations as go routines or not? If yes, do i need to add graceful shutdown to these operations or will the goroutines terminate automatically after main app is closed? If yes, then can I just cancel the contextWithCancel context I gave to Jobmanager, will it terminate the pdf operation too?</p> <p>If I use the main App Context of the wails application to create context of pdf operations, like this: <strong>pdfOperationCtx, cancel := context.WithCancel(appCtx)</strong><code>, is this the right way to proceed?</code></p> <p>Also, kindly give any other tips that might be useful for me.

We are currently encountering a stack overflow problem on a remote machine, and one idea I got was to investigate the stack during integration test execution to maybe know which struct is &quot;too big&quot; (we have no recursion and neither infinite loops since the program never failed somewhere else than that specefic red hat machine).</p> <p>However, I was never successfull to debug my program, I am almost forever giving up on debuggers. I tried LLDB with rust rover, with vsode and on terminal, nothing works, the breakpoints always get skipped. Almost every tutorial on this topic debugs very simple hello world apps (which I could debug too !) but never a huge monorepo of 15 nested projects like mine.</p> <p>Currently, I am working with VSCode + LLDB, and the problem is that wherever I set my breakpoints, the program never stop, the test executes as if I did nothing. Can you please help me or at least send me a guide that can teach me how to setup correctly a debugger for a huge project ?

What about environments, where there is no underlying os, that needs to calculate things, everytime i beg it for memory?<br/> Would the advice still be to allocate once and reuse, even if that means i need to iterate the underlying array once more to set its state to all 0, or is the cost of allocation so small, that i can just create arrays whereever i need them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonrrrs"> /u/Jonrrrs </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k7id8f/embedded_memory_allocations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k7id8f/embedded_memory_allocations/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I&#39;m super excited to share the very first release (v0.1.0) of a project I&#39;ve been working on: <strong>Codebase Viewer</strong>.</p> <p><strong>GitHub Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/noahbclarkson/codebase_viewer">https://github.com/noahbclarkson/codebase_viewer</a> (Feedback &amp; contributions welcome!)</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Codebase Viewer is a cross-platform desktop tool written entirely in Rust (using the wonderful <code>egui</code> library via <code>eframe</code>) that lets you quickly scan, explore, selectively check files/directories, and generate detailed reports (Markdown, HTML, Text) about codebases. It&#39;s fast, respects <code>.gitignore</code>, has syntax highlighting/image previews, and is particularly useful for prepping code context for Large Language Models (LLMs).</p> <p><strong>The &quot;Why&quot; - My Daily LLM Workflow Problem</strong></p> <p>Like many of you, I&#39;ve been integrating LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) more and more into my development workflow. They&#39;re fantastic for explaining code, suggesting refactors, writing tests, or even generating boilerplate. However, I constantly hit the same wall: <strong>context limits and the pain of copy-pasting</strong>.</p> <p>Trying to explain a specific function or module to an LLM often requires providing not just the code itself, but also context about <em>where</em> it fits in the larger project. What other modules does it interact with? What&#39;s the overall directory structure? Manually copy-pasting relevant files <em>and</em> trying to describe the structure is tedious, error-prone, and quickly eats up token limits. Pasting the <em>entire</em> codebase is usually impossible.</p> <p>I needed a way to:</p> <ol> <li>Quickly visualize the <em>entire</em> structure of a project.</li> <li>Easily select <em>only</em> the specific files and directories relevant to my current query.</li> <li>Generate a concise, formatted output that includes <strong>both the selected code snippets AND the overall directory structure</strong> (to give the LLM context).</li> <li>Do this <em>fast</em> without waiting ages for scans.</li> </ol> <p>That&#39;s exactly why I built Codebase Viewer.</p> <p><strong>My Personal Anecdote: Using it Daily</strong></p> <p>Honestly, I now use this tool <em>every single day</em>. Before I ask an LLM about a piece of my code, I fire up Codebase Viewer:</p> <ol> <li><code>File &gt; Open Directory...</code> and point it at my project root.</li> <li>The scan starts immediately and the tree view populates in milliseconds (thanks, <code>ignore</code> crate and <code>rayon</code>!). It respects my <code>.gitignore</code> automatically.</li> <li>I navigate the tree, expanding directories as needed.</li> <li>I check the boxes next to the specific <code>.rs</code> files, <code>Cargo.toml</code>, maybe a <a href="http://README.md"><code>README.md</code></a> section, or even entire modules (<code>src/ui</code>, <code>src/fs</code>) that are relevant to the code I want the LLM to analyze.</li> <li><code>File &gt; Generate Report...</code>. I usually pick Markdown format, make sure &quot;Include Selected File Contents&quot; is checked, and maybe uncheck &quot;Include Statistics&quot; if the LLM doesn&#39;t need it.</li> <li><em>Click</em>. It generates a Markdown report containing: <ul> <li>The full directory structure (so the LLM knows the overall layout).</li> <li>The <em>selected</em> directory structure (highlighting what I chose).</li> <li>The actual content of <em>only</em> the files I checked, each clearly marked with its path, size, etc.</li> </ul></li> <li>I copy this Markdown report and paste it directly into my LLM prompt, often prefixed with something like &quot;Analyze the following code snippets within the context of this project structure:&quot;.</li> </ol> <p>The difference is night and day. The LLM gets focused code <em>plus</em> the structural context it needs, leading to much more accurate and helpful responses, without me wasting time manually curating snippets and drawing ASCII trees.</p> <p><strong>Okay, So What Does v0.1.0 Actually Do?</strong></p> <p>Codebase Viewer aims to be a helpful developer utility for understanding and documenting code.

I tried to increase the executable file&#39;s permissions to root, but I still got a fake data link layer header (this is actually an important reason for launching this project).</p> <p>Secondly, this <code>pcap</code> library does not support filters, which is easy to understand. In order to implement packet filtering, we have to implement these functions ourselves (it will be very uncomfortable to use).</p> <p>The third is that you need to install additional libraries (<code>libpcap</code> &amp; <code>libpcap-dev</code>) to use the <code>pcap</code> library.</p> <p>Then these two softwares are the products of my 20% spare time, and suggestions are welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rikonaka"> /u/rikonaka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k7bi3o/the_next_generation_of_traffic_capture_software/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k7bi3o/the_next_generation_of_traffic_capture_software/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This will be the last of my story telling here, Thank you everyone for the support. Today I&#39;m covering the last 8 years of my employment at Infinity Ward, if you remember I was one of the original 27 that created the game.</p> <p>One of the AI behaviors in the game, I believe it was Medal Of Honor: Allies Assault, that has soldiers jumping on grenades to save their teammates. Doing Tools Engineering is kind of like that. Heroic, sacrificial, noble.</p> <p>With a growing tendency to spend my work hours on Tooling things, to which I really did enjoy. I was doing some white box design on some really cool space ship physics. In Call of Duty we typically would delegate that work to an engineer but I wanted to try and learn and exercise math things. I had script spawned a &quot;script_model&quot; which is about as raw as you can get for a GSC scripter and scripted things to get a prototype scene that is kind of like 3D asteroids. These ships had side thrusters, forward and back. They maintained velocity trajectory and all those cool things. I remember thinking. Cool, a combat oriented vehicle in space might take the design of not having wings. There was a lot of interesting stuff that I was pressing on there that was not in my job description as Level Designer. It&#39;s the type of exploratory thing you would do between Games as a designer.</p> <p>I was drawn to programming, wanting more than the high-level stuff that you do in that level design space. It didn&#39;t feel like jumping on the grenade, maybe more like moth-to-a-flame. I always got distracted with these things that could improve workflow and remember thinking a lot about the math of those efforts. If something improved my efficiency by 5% as a level designer. That gets multiplied times however many people also benefiting from that 5%. Often times though, those efforts ended up being just for me. I never wanted to overcommit to a tool engineering effort because I could feel the effect on my own work as a level designer. What if my tool change broke someone&#39;s workflow, and I then had to tend to fixing that tool change.</p> <p>In addition to that math, was that more efficient tooling means that designers can Fail faster. Design is hard to get right and being nimble with the support of good tools can help you find the fun faster.</p> <p>To me, things were pointing to go-all-in. The lack of 1 level designer would mean that the efficiency of my peers would go up and they would be able to fill in the gaps left by my absence. Also, there was a lot of things that were just quirky at Infinity Ward. &quot;Tribal Knowledge&quot; we called it. With the incoming hires I thought it would be really nice to kind of support them by fixing up the quirks and smoothing out the process.</p> <h1>A small miracle</h1> <p>You have to know that Infinity Ward doesn&#39;t hire slouches. The Engineering team especially can really hard on it&#39;s applicants. I was very underqualified for the position. The best quality I can say about Infinity Ward is their ability to work dynamically with people. People have different strengths and attributes. For me, I had experience in the code-base. I knew how to use all the tools already, and I spoke the tribal language of Infinity Ward. With a proprietary toolset there&#39;s going to be a long ramp-up with any Engineer.</p> <p>What I did not have was strong native programing skills (C++). They would throw their standard programmers test at me to see how I would do. I don&#39;t remember the details of the test, but it was kind of like a 3d Minesweeper challenge to write the bucket filling efficiently. I built a really strong TEXT based 2D minesweeper, how did I miss the 3d part, I don&#39;t know. But my C++ minesweeper had a randomly generated field to test the bucket filling. I should have failed, but I guess that with my background it was good enough.</p> <p>The team had plenty of tools that didn&#39;t do native C++ and they would ramp those things in over time. I was awarded the title &quot;Associate Tools Engineer&quot;. The team took me under their wing, and it was an opportunity like no other. I got a Software Engineering job with no college education and no school. </p> <h1>My Naivety about Tools Engineering</h1> <p>I knew I&#39;d have increased responsibility with Tools, but in my mind at the time I thought it would be simply working on the Tools that I was used to working on as a designer, and that now being sanctioned by the team ( no more rogue-Nate working on tools ). I was so wrong!</p> <p>Associate Tools Engineer, is kind of a bloodbath of tool work. I would get to work on EVERYTHING. Things that I really didn&#39;t think about as a Level Designer. I thought I would work on the Level Editor some more, or take the Scripting IDE to the next level, get those 5% efficiency increases rolling. I really didn&#39;t think about stats reporting on outsourced assets, and sound dialogue management tools, I didn&#39;t think about the AI tools that were really needing someone to fiddle with the framework and get the buttons to work right. I didn&#39;t think about Multiplayer analytics, I didn&#39;t think about pipeline things, nor DevOps.</p> <p>I watch a lot of Deadliest Catch and the ship has an engineer onboard. The engineer didn&#39;t design the ship. He&#39;s just there to keep the ship in working order. He is absolutely required. That&#39;s kind of how I learned to accept this position, though I would get to do some of those efficiency things, but a lot of it is simply fire fighting.</p> <p>One thing I also got to experience with engineering is that the work often continues after hours, not so much in a sense of sitting in front of the screen jamming out code, but in terms of brain-time. It can be extra difficult to turn it off at the end of the day. Sometimes solutions to problems disrupt sleep. You might even find me out in my office at 4AM because I just have to get something out of my head and into actual code.</p> <h1>Not a sexy job</h1> <p>I love programming, it&#39;s cool, but unlike the Level Design items where I get to tell the story about which levels people get to experience. My Engineering accomplishments kind of get buried in there, the timeline is a blur AND, the topics are private. I also thought that this experience might open up possibilities for other kinds of work, should anything happen to my position at Infinity Ward where I was able to work from home.</p> <p>There&#39;s just nothing really to show for it, but the WHOLE GAME..</p> <p>There&#39;s kind of this Intangible effect that I do believe I had on the game, particularly as I worked more and more on those developer efficiency things. I really really enjoyed sitting with a late build of Infinite Warfare and playing without having participated in any of the design for it. It&#39;s such a brilliant game with top notch story telling and art direction.</p> <p>There&#39;s a significant upgrade to the core game in MW2019 that I know that I had a lot to do with. I was also kind of a big player in improving Work-From-Home. On the fly stuff, the hero engineers keeping the ship going while the whole world was underwater with Covid-19. I take a great deal of pride in keeping Call of Duty on top. </p> <h1>The Success of Respawn</h1> <p>This was also a highlight, if you&#39;ve been reading these, you know that during CoD4, Infinity Ward tried to split itself into two teams. It was unsuccessful there. With Respawn, the split was successful. I remember watching the reveal for Titanfall like 100 times. I was so proud of them. There may have even been a tear shed. So cool, We finally did it! </p> <p>I talk to some of those guys occasionally, if you are on my YouTube channel I had a special there with Brad Allen, who goes way back. Very cool stuff. I hope to do more. It&#39;s been cool to watch from afar, my other team.</p> <p>Ultimately, gamers won! They got two killer Sci-Fi games. </p> <h1>Continued Success at Infinity Ward</h1> <p>We did success again with Modern Warfare 2/3 and as the three studio&#39;s learned how to work closer and closer this created some Engineering Redundancy, IW was trying to figure out how to move the pieces, but the unfortunate hammer needed to drop. I remember coming in a smidge early to check in a big code change, I always liked doing the early morning submits. I pressed submit, and noticed a regular meeting was canceled, &quot;Because of the news&quot;, 1900 people were laid off on January 26th, 2024.</p> <p>I have been unemployed ever since.</p> <p>There were several times, during my 8 years as a Tools Engineer that I thought about going back to level design. You know I could still dabble in the engineering stuff but I miss being in the trenches sometimes. I don&#39;t actually know what I want to do next. I have been equally applying for game play engineering and Tools Engineering. </p> <p>I have even considered level design again, writing these articles certainly has created a stir within. I just need the entire games industry to wake up from its slumber so I can get back to work!</p> <p>Despite being Jobless, my spirits are high, I could walk away entirely and be happy with accomplishments. The break that I have had has been enjoyable, maybe much needed.</p> <p>Thanks for your patience as I&#39;ve been dumping these articles to Reddit.. this is the last story.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Going to Tools Engineering from Level Design is a lot harder than expected, I have had a great career and looking forward to what&#39;s next!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Front-Independence40"> /u/Front-Independence40 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7yzlj/8_years_as_tools_engineer_for_call_of_duty/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7yzlj/8_years_as_tools_engineer_for_call_of_duty/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Building a game, worthy of other people&#39;s time, is hard. It takes a loooong fcking time. At the start, it&#39;s exciting. You have milestones you reach, you see how far your talent can get you, you&#39;re discovering an entire world of possibilities, creating anything you want as if you were god, and so on.</p> <p>But once your character is done, game loop is pretty good, you&#39;ve got a good looking level, insane vfx, enemy you wanted is done, shaded, animated, you&#39;re there looking at what you have made, and it&#39;s not enough. You have about 5-10% of what you had in mind done. After... thousands of hours learning and working over months/years.</p> <p>And not only that, it also starts to gets overwhelming. You coded too fast. Didn&#39;t document. Everything is barely holding together. A lot of your assets are placeholders. You&#39;ve greyboxed too much as in assets but also system prototypes. The work needed to bring everything up to the standard of quality you were going for extends beyond what you can imagine. Your mind cracks, breaks in half. Not to mention the mental exhaustion, burnout. Wondering if that project became more of a prison than creative freedom. Needing you to dedicate so much more time of your life to finish it.</p> <p>When fun turns to work, passion turns to discipline, what gets you to keep going?</p> <p>And just to be clear, I&#39;m not complaining. I&#39;m in a position a lot would dream of. Being able to make anything in Blender/Unreal, having a beast of a PC. And I&#39;m not planning to quit. For me, I need to make it work. I would never forgive myself if I were to quit, or at least not releasing it having given my all. The only thing I need, is a way to keep going no matter what.</p> <p>Because life is full of distractions. Emotions, desires, feelings, they are all luring away from the mission. Family, finances, responsibilities, still trying to lure away. And sometimes, you do have moments of weakness. Getting lured away, for a day, a weak, sometimes even a month. But the game is still there, not finished. It needs you to get back at it. It needs to be released. It needs to be shown. It needs to provide the experience it was meant to, to provide enjoyment, to share your dreams.</p> <p>Now there&#39;s a couple of things that helps such attaching your sense of self respect and self worth on how much you can dedicate yourself to working on it, chasing pride in your work, chasing praise/recognition (people playing and engaging), chasing financial success and so on. Which are all valid things imo (yes, trying to make money is valid; it&#39;s the #1 indicator of how well you did, how much people liked what they saw except if you&#39;re a scammer).</p> <p>But I would like to know, you, personally, what gets you going? Are you still in love with it, with burning passion? Are you tied to it financially? Are you one of those creativity chads that are just addicted to creating stuff? Do you listen to motivational videos/podcasts to get you going? What is it that keeps you going? Still chasing the indie solo game dev dream? Trying to prove others, or yourself, that you can do it?</p> <p>You can&#39;t just work on it when you feel like it. Otherwise it&#39;ll never get finished. Or it just won&#39;t be good. It requires obsession, consistency, discipline.</p> <p>It needs something, deep down, that&#39;ll push you. That &#39;ll make you want it bad enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight_Season_4500"> /u/Slight_Season_4500 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7rogs/if_youre_an_indie_solo_game_dev_what_gets_you_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7rogs/if_youre_an_indie_solo_game_dev_what_gets_you_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>Like many aspiring game devs, I‚Äôve spent many hours scrolling through <a href="/r/gamedev">r/gamedev</a>, learning from all the amazing threads about development, marketing, and launching a game. I‚Äôve always been especially fond of posts that dive into real numbers, wishlists, conversions, and early sales data, and I think it‚Äôs now time to give back.</p> <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> First game. Two-man team. RPG. 4 years of development, then 4 years in Early Access.<br/> Good sales. Lots of data: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/slormancer-ea-wishlists-sales-xrUVnS1">https://imgur.com/a/slormancer-ea-wishlists-sales-xrUVnS1</a> </p> <p><strong>The Game</strong></p> <p>For clarity, I‚Äôll be naming the game (<strong>The Slormancer</strong>) and linking our Steam page. ‚Äôll be sharing detailed stats on wishlists and sales, and the Steam Page being the number 1 selling tool, I believe that it is important to see what it looks like.</p> <p>Steam Page: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104280/The_Slormancer/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1104280/The_Slormancer/</a> </p> <p>We don‚Äôt claim to have nailed the perfect Steam page, but we followed advice from people like Chris Zukowski, tight and clear text, strong trailer, polished screenshots, GIFs, etc.</p> <p>We chose a very unusual name: The Slormancer. It doesn‚Äôt follow best practices, but we feel it reflects the game‚Äôs quirky personality. It‚Äôs a bit silly and it fits us well.</p> <p><strong>The Development</strong></p> <p>We‚Äôre just a two-person team, and The Slormancer is our first (and only) game. We started it as a side project in late 2017 while working full-time jobs, which we eventually quit shortly before releasing in Early Access.</p> <p>We were complete beginners. Literally started with YouTube tutorials on how to move a 2D sprite, draw pixel art, and code procedural dungeons. The game was developed using GameMaker: Studio 1, then 2.</p> <p>The original plan was to make a small roguelike dungeon crawler in 6 to 12 months.</p> <p>Imgur Album : <a href="https://imgur.com/a/slormancer-ea-wishlists-sales-xrUVnS1">https://imgur.com/a/slormancer-ea-wishlists-sales-xrUVnS1</a></p> <p>But once we had a working prototype (see the imgur album)‚Ä¶ we just kept going. It was fun. We loved learning and improving every part of the game. It became a really organic process, never stressful, just exciting. Game dev was (and still is) something I genuinely enjoy. And I don‚Äôt think we ever felt bored or burnt out. And the small roguelike dungeon crawler turned into a fully-featured A-RPG.</p> <p>That‚Äôs how a ‚Äúsmall project‚Äù ended up taking nearly 4 years to reach Early Access. We know that‚Äôs not ideal advice for a first game, but it worked for us.This post isn‚Äôt a list of ‚Äúdos and don‚Äôts‚Äù, just a retrospective on what happened. It‚Äôs worked out pretty well, but we know it‚Äôs not the most efficient route.</p> <p>I‚Äôm here to give as much hindsight as I possibly can to help other gamedevs, but I‚Äôm definitely not here to list do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.We did our own thing, it has its flaws, but it has worked out for us. I‚Äôm sure we could have done things better and since we only have experience with this single game, we have no way to compare it to another game that has used a similar strategy.</p> <p>Talking about strategy, we‚Äôre still on a zero marketing budget. We‚Äôve spent probably $300 for using a few apps that we‚Äôve been using, and hosting our website. But that‚Äôs about it.</p> <p><strong>The Stats:</strong></p> <p>Before opening our Steam Page, we‚Äôve made a couple of posts on reddit such as on <a href="/r/pixelart">r/pixelart</a>, to get a first taste of what sharing our work would do to us. And we only had a Twitter account that we would try to grow.</p> <p>On September 12, 2019, we opened our Steam Page. I believe that we had about 100 to 200 followers on Twitter, but that‚Äôs about it.</p> <p><strong>Steam Page - Wishlists - Week 1</strong></p> <p>We‚Äôve gained 929 wishlists on the first week of our Steam Page, with 550 on the first day. We had a small reveal trailer ready that we shared on 4 subreddits (<a href="/r/indiegames">r/indiegames</a>, <a href="/r/indiegaming">r/indiegaming</a>, <a href="/r/gameslikediablo">r/gameslikediablo</a> and <a href="/r/rpg_gamers">r/rpg_gamers</a>). Everything can be found on our profile so you can have a look. We‚Äôve had good success posting there. Our only other action was to share our Steam Page on Twitter.</p> <p>I‚Äôll briefly talk about other social networks here: we‚Äôve tried Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and it never worked.Outside of Steam, we‚Äôve only had good success with Reddit and that‚Äôs pretty much it. Twitter has been useful later down the line to get noticed by very targeted users, but never to reach a broad audience.</p> <p><strong>Wishlists - 9 Months in</strong></p> <p>I chose the 9 months mark, because after that, we‚Äôve participated in a Steam Next Fest, and things tend to go faster from there. As you can see on the imgur album, we reached 5 000 wishlists. Besides the original reddit posts, we did another round of posting on reddit in October 2019 and one more in April 2020.</p> <p>During that time, we had a strict marketing schedule: I would spend every monday morning creating 3 gifs from the game and would schedule them via pubbler on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, but as I mentionned above, we only saw results on Twitter.I scheduled at random hours, trying to find good spots. On top of that I would also bundle all 3 gifs and build a small video out of it that we would post on saturdays with the #screenshotsaturday tag. A very positive side of the genre we‚Äôre developing (hack‚Äôn slash / Action RPG) is that combining various skills and effect to get crazy outcomes is at the core of the gameplay loop so creating gifs was a very easy thing to do.</p> <p>I would also post a devlog every 3 to 4 months on Steam, so nothing spectacular. And we did make about 5 or 6 YouTube videos that were slightly upgraded compilations of our daily gifs. We also prepared a website that you can easily find on the Steam Page, along with a nice PressKit.This grew our Twitter account to a few hundred followers and helped us grow our Discord Channel and our Steam subscribers.</p> <p><strong>Wishlists - Steam Next Fest 1</strong></p> <p>In June 2020, we participated in what was called Steam Gaming Festival. I believe it was the second edition of what is now called Steam Next Fest. We had prepared a good and pretty generous demo. I don‚Äôt recall being at the top of any chart. We did a small Q&amp;A during the event, averaging 40 viewers but that‚Äôs about it. And we got 2 451 wishlists out of the event, bringing us to 7 510 wishlists.</p> <p>A few days after the event, Wanderbots (an indiegaming channel with about 500k subscribers) shared a video of him playing the demo. We instantly got 1 000 more wishlists the first day. Then I believe Steam started showing the game to more people.<strong>Wishlists - 1 year</strong></p> <p>We got to 22 664 wishlists after a year. As you can see in the chart, we would average 150 wishlists per day after the Steam Next Fest and Wanderbots video, so we were incredibly happy. </p> <p><strong>Wishlists - 15 days before release</strong></p> <p>This part is interesting. And we don‚Äôt really get what happened: In october 2020, we participated in a second Steam Next Fest, and again had good results with an additional 2,500 wishlists, then right after that, the curve drops down to around 10 to 20 wishlists per day, almost until the release.</p> <p>15 days before release, we had 32 611 wishlists.</p> <p>Wishlists - Release Day</p> <p>On release week we gained 36 836 wishlists, and 8 975 were removed due to purchases, netting 27 000 wishlists for a total of 63 344.</p> <p>A lesson that we‚Äôve learned is that Steam does the heavy lifting. It it absurd how you can spend every single monday of the past year struggling to gain a few wishlists a day when being on the ‚ÄúPopular Upcoming‚Äù tab of Steam grants 2 to 4 000 wishlists per day. This is, of course, not exactly how it works, and we wouldn‚Äôt be on ‚ÄúPopular Upcoming‚Äù if it wasn‚Äôt for the previous wishlists. But still.</p> <p>We spent from April 3 to April 6 being Top 3 in ‚ÄúUpcoming and Popular‚Äù, then on release day, we were on ‚ÄúTop Sellers‚Äù for about 4 hours. Being in Early Access, we didn‚Äôt have access to ‚ÄúNew and Trending‚Äù. </p> <p><strong>Wishlists - 1 month after release</strong></p> <p>This will be my final word on wishlists, since after that we‚Äôll be looking for sales.</p> <p>After a month, we went to 181 788 wishlists. We activated 27 508 wishlists that month for a total of 144 081 wishlists, after about 10 000 deletions.</p> <p>After Steam‚Äôs initial massive boost, we had streamers and youtubers play the game so I believe we gained a lot of wishlists from there as well. But again, Steam did the most part.</p> <p><strong>Sales - Day 1 &amp; Week 1</strong></p> <p>We sold 16 065 copies on the first day, and a total of 54 389 copies in a week.</p> <p>This is absolutely insane looking back at this number, yet when we released the game, we were so busy making sure that everyone was having fun, reading feedback, fixing bugs and thinking about changes that we would need to make that I don‚Äôt even recall looking at these numbers, and even less understanding what it would mean.</p> <p>Handling that big of a hit was pretty hard at first. We were, and still are, two, and that was a lot to take. I also think that we‚Äôre not built up for this, we probably care too much. So handling negative feedback is something that we had to learn the hard way. And the first months were actually pretty hard for us despite the sales. </p> <p>Anyway, as I‚Äôve mentioned above, we‚Äôve had streamer and youtubers play our game on release day, which helped a lot. We had quite a bit of small to medium sized youtubers and streamers hat fitted our niche perfectly, but we also had big names such as SplatterCatGaming or Wanderbots, and Quin69 or Sodapoppin on Twitch.</p> <p>A few weeks before the release, we sent a carefully crafted email (linked in the imgur folder) to about 400 people. We did our selection using sullygnome and manual research, looking for all sizes of youtubers/streamers as long as they would fit the indie or arpg niche.</p> <p>I believe the mail is something that we did right. </p> <p><strong>Sales - Month 1</strong></p> <p>In the first month, we sold 70 408 units. And 27 241 were from activated wishlists, so this gives a wishlist to Sales ratio of about 38% which I believe is absolutely crazy. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say that we had very fresh wishlists and that there was some kind of ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù surrounding our release, with a handful of streamers playing it, creating a bit of a FOMO, leading to players adding the game to their wishlist, watching a bit more of a stream or a video then buying it. I might be completely wrong tho.</p> <p><strong>Sales - Year 1 and 2,3 and 4</strong></p> <p>We sold a total of 108 001 units during our first year. And about half that number was made during the first week.</p> <p>There‚Äôs not much to say about these sales, after our Early Access release, we decided that it was simply not sustainable to keep marketing and interacting the way we did to get to that release and that we would not be able to maintain that hype throughout Early Access to get to the release. We focused on offering the best experience possible and worked with the feedback of our community to polish our game. </p> <p>So sending that email is almost the last thing we did marketing-wise in the past 4 years. Obviously, now that we‚Äôre getting to closer to the actual release, we‚Äôre again much more focused on marketing, but we went silent for about 3 years.</p> <p><strong>Side note on Community Management</strong></p> <p>Another thing that I believe we did right is being efficient in Community Management. We don‚Äôt see that subject brought up much but keeping your core community happy for a long time is not easy, and definitely requires time and dedication. A month after the release, I started writing a monthly devlog called ‚ÄúThe Slormite Chronicles‚Äù that would always be posted on the 6th of every month. This worked out really well. Players would know when to expect news, and even when we didn‚Äôt have much to say, we would share our honest progress, so we never had to deal with an unhappy community because of a silent dev. On that day, I would also try to be present and answer questions on Steam and on Discord.</p> <p>We don‚Äôt do it enough, but interacting with players is key to build a solid and lasting playerbase. We could <em>feel</em> our players being happier after a small chat with them on Steam or Discord.</p> <p><strong>Back to Sales</strong></p> <p>During Early Access, we sold the following number of units:</p> <p>Sales - Year 2: +43 886</p> <p>Sales - Year 3: +13 445</p> <p>Sales - Year 4: +7 815</p> <p>After 4 years, we sold over 173 128 units (and a few more on GOG), and we‚Äôre currently at 166 434 wishlists. Even though it is pretty stale, that wishlist count actually moves a lot, our typical day is +150 additions, +150 deletions and a few sales. This means that even if it no longer goes up, we‚Äôre having a bit of a turn over and are still getting fresh wishlists. It‚Äôs something!</p> <p>Our experience tells us that, since we‚Äôre a team of two, we&#39;re always trying to optimize. Following the Pareto principle, we believe it&#39;s better not to grind for a few extra wishlists each day, but to focus on making the best possible game for release and let Steam do its thing. </p> <p>We‚Äôve also managed to secure a ‚ÄúDaily Deal‚Äù on release day.If we do things right, and with the support of relevant streamers, we should hit ‚ÄúNew and Popular‚Äù. From there, we either made a good game and sales will follow or we didn‚Äôt.</p> <p>We‚Äôll obviously make another post in a year or so after the release to give additional data about the release itself.</p> <p><strong>Languages</strong></p> <p>I‚Äôve posted the language breakdown of our sales and I‚Äôd like to add a few details. The Slormancer was translated in French (we‚Äôre french by the way), in English, in Simplified Chinese (for China) and Traditional Chinese (for Taiwain). And as you can see, these 4 countries are on top of the charts. China being number one.</p> <p>I believe we‚Äôve always maintained a good relationship with streamers, youtubers and our french community so this has led to France being top 3. And contacting french websites or youtubers is always much easier, we often got the ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre french too, let‚Äôs do this‚Äù reply. </p> <p>As you can see, year after year our sales in China started declining, which leads me to my next point:</p> <p><strong>Reviews</strong></p> <p>If we exclude Chinese reviews, I believe we‚Äôre sitting at about 87% Very Positive rating. And if we only look at Chine reviews, we are around 65% Mixed rating. I haven‚Äôt checked in a while but it‚Äôs somewhere around these values.</p> <p>This is something to take into account. It‚Äôs easy to say now, but if I were to do it again, I believe that I would only add Chinese at the end of Early Access. </p> <p>We‚Äôve had a lot of negative reviews coming from Chinese players for being slow devs, and a whole lot more for having a poor translation. </p> <p>If my informations are correct, I believe that Chinese players do not have access to Steam forums, even less Discord, and that their only way to communicate with developers is throught reviews. So it can get a bit hard to manage.Regarding the translation, we had a Chinese editor that didn‚Äôt complete its part of the deal and we were left with an unfinished translation for the rest of Early Access, and every new update we would add would not be translated. This is definitely something that we did wrong and we should have taken the time to find another partner to keep up with our updates. </p> <p>I think that‚Äôs about it. I hope this was useful to at least someone. </p> <p>I may edit the post if something new comes to mind.<br/> We‚Äôll be happy to answer any questions you might have, or share additional data.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slormite_Studios"> /u/Slormite_Studios </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7hr97/from_zero_experience_to_selling_50_000_copies_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7hr97/from_zero_experience_to_selling_50_000_copies_on/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guy, last week I released my third game, that took me around two years to make, called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2336120/Do_Not_Press_The_Button_Or_Youll_Delete_The_Multiverse/">Do Not Press The Button (Or You&#39;ll Delete The Multiverse)</a></p> <p>The gist of the previous post was that I was getting a lot of negative reviews from China and decided to ask redditors for advice if anything can be done. Today (5 days later) the game went from MIXED to MOSTLY POSITIVE :) So let me share what happened:</p> <p>First let me address few mistakes that I made and the comments were rightful to point them out. I mistakenly saw a negative review in Chinese and then quickly scroll trough others bellow it and thought most are in Chinese. Turns out it was the only one. Actually most of negative reviews were from Japan and Korea. I have to apologize for this mistake on my part. These languages if you don&#39;t know them and you don&#39;t pay attention, kind of look the same. It&#39;s not an excuse but I was crunching on the game for the past week and got 4 hours of sleep a day and it was easy to miss stuff like that.</p> <p>I then went to Chat GPT, pasted every single CH, KO, JP review (I did this later for all reviews) and asked it to give me the overall player opinion (I also asked it to translate all of them individually so I can read them). Here are the results:</p> <p><strong>Humor/jokes</strong> feel awkward or unfunny.</p> <p><strong>Shallow gameplay</strong> with no depth or payoff (feels tedious or meaningless).</p> <p><strong>Translation/localization</strong> issues (some sections not translated or unclear).</p> <p><strong>Technical issues</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Poor pacing and structure</strong>: Too slow or repetitive.</p> <p><strong>Failed expectations</strong>: Especially from fans of <em>The Stanley Parable</em>‚Äîthis feels like a knockoff rather than a proper homage.</p> <p>Here are some suggestions that I got from you guys:</p> <p>1 De-list the game for these regions</p> <p>2 Try to understand Asian culture better</p> <p>3 Fix the most common bugs</p> <p>1 So I didn&#39;t know you could do that, but from the start I had this fear that the game&#39;s quirky humor wouldn&#39;t translate well. I was kind of right since the #1 complaint is that jokes don&#39;t work. I also make references in the game to western films like Life of Brian, Star Wars, A Few Good Men. But I still thought that de-listing the game is a little extreme and I would prefer to try and understand why my humor doesn&#39;t work and what can be improved.</p> <p>2 So I know it takes lifetimes to understand other cultures but I tried my best (that you can do in a week). First of all I learned that Korean culture in particular is hard on younger people. They are under so much pressure to ace their exams and get a good job. They do classes almost all day and night and barely rest. So I guess that when they start a game they want to escape this and if the game has some issues with jokes or bugs, it takes away from their &quot;ME&quot; time. I tried to learn some Chinese jokes too, to better understand how things would be if we flipped things. Here is a typical Chinese joke:</p> <p>The teacher asks: ‚ÄúXiao Ming, if one of your ears got cut off, what would you be like?‚Äù<br/> Xiao Ming replies: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have trouble hearing.‚Äù<br/> Teacher says: ‚ÄúAnd if <em>both</em> ears were cut off?‚Äù<br/> Xiao Ming seriously responds:<br/> <strong>‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd have trouble seeing.‚Äù</strong></p> <p>So this jokes works only if you know who Xiao Ming is. In Chinese culture it&#39;s a typical nerdy school boy with glasses. Kind of like Little Timmy for Americans or something like that? If you know Xiao wears glasses, then it&#39;s funny because if you cut both his years his glasses will fall off.</p> <p>I also sent a friend request to every single person that left a negative review on Steam and DM&#39;d them and basically Apologized that they had issues with the game and asked them what can I do to fix their experience.<br/> One dude in particular played it for 4 hours, then left a negative review, then played for 7 hours more hah. He said that he felt emotional at the end of the game, it made him feel something, but didn&#39;t like some of the bugs. (also he forgot his PC on when he beat the game and tried to get all achievements, so he didn&#39;t play for the full 11 hours). We did release a Major Patch the previous day and I told him about it and he changed his review to Recommended.</p> <p>Another two players also did the same which made me happy. And for those that didn&#39;t at least I got to speak to them directly and understand their problems. One even joined our Discord although he still had negative review of the game. This dude said that when he enters the first big room the is not sure where to go or why. (In this area there are 3 doors with keypads, you need to find the key code. Maybe I should communicate this better?)</p> <ol> <li>We have a Feedback form in the main menu and I received around 50 bug reports. Of them like 3-4 were game breaking, but I (and my brother) relinquished all sleep to get them fixed. And a few days ago we released a Major Patch that addresses the issues reported by players (soft locking, lack of checkpoints, localization) . From what I understand (and please correct me here) Chinese, Korean, Japanese players are harsher and don&#39;t tolerate bugs as much. I saw a few American streamers who encountered bugs and they just laugh it off. I admire the aforementioned cultures&#39;s strive for perfection and I will try to playtest and polish my future projects as much as I can.</li> </ol> <p>Overall when I made that post the game had Mixed reviews rating and thanks to all of these efforts today it sits at mostly positive. We are also preparing another small update for the weekend. Thank you for reading :)</p> <p>Edit: And to end on a positive, here some reactions by Streamers finishing the game:</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/rMItrC57rS8?si=TWV9w4JhzO5kneuI&amp;t=12294">#1</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lky8LuirVtY?si=np6CNk1ynTLqsHyt&amp;t=10722">#2</a></p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Theseus_Games/status/1915666038105969028">#</a><a href="https://x.com/Theseus_Games/status/1915666038105969028">3</a><br/> <a href="https://x.com/Theseus_Games/status/1914764729941098749">#4</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Captain0010"> /u/Captain0010 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7glfr/my_newly_released_comedic_indie_game_was_getting/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7glfr/my_newly_released_comedic_indie_game_was_getting/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to share something that‚Äôs been on my mind. A lot of posts here are about people quitting their jobs to go all-in on making their dream game, and I totally get it ‚Äì it‚Äôs inspiring. But I thought I‚Äôd put a little twist on that.</p> <p>I didn‚Äôt quit my job. In fact, I still work full-time while developing my game on the side, and honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.</p> <p>My job helps me stay grounded. It pays the bills, gives me structure, and I actually enjoy the moments when I can work on my game. Sometimes at work, there‚Äôs not much to do, and since I‚Äôm in IT, I can make progress on my game during those times. It allows me to move forward without pressure.</p> <p>I recently launched my Steam page, and while I don‚Äôt push promotions too hard, getting 2-3 wishlists a day still makes me super happy! It‚Äôs those little victories that keep me motivated. I also try to run some events to promote the game, but at my own pace.</p> <p>So here‚Äôs my message: Don‚Äôt rush it. Don‚Äôt let the pressure get to you. You‚Äôve got time. The most important thing is to enjoy the process of making your game. It‚Äôs a journey. Yes, it‚Äôs tough sometimes, but it‚Äôs also incredibly rewarding.</p> <p>By the way, I‚Äôm making a card game, and while I‚Äôm primarily a developer, I love to dive into other areas too. Art, sound design, game mechanics ‚Äì I love experimenting with everything. That‚Äôs the fun of it!</p> <p>Keep enjoying the process, and remember, there‚Äôs no one right way to do this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wyyyne"> /u/Wyyyne </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7enlx/i_didnt_quit_my_job_and_its_working_just_fine/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k7enlx/i_didnt_quit_my_job_and_its_working_just_fine/">[comments]</a></span></div>
