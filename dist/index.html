            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working on a web game in wasm using web-sys, and I wanted to make a struct <code>Table</code> wrapping a <code>HtmlTableElement</code> and have a function on <code>Table</code> to add a row, but also add an event listener to the row that calls another function on <code>Table</code> when the row is clicked. I couldn&#39;t immediately figure out how to do it because the closure that you pass to <code>set_onclick</code> has to be <code>&#39;static</code> so you can&#39;t just call <code>self.on_row_clicked()</code> in it. I&#39;ve done something similar before but it doesn&#39;t work here because I want the <code>on_row_clicked</code> function to also create more rows in the table and add more event listeners that call the same function when clicked.</p> <p>I tried a few things but couldn&#39;t get it to work, and I couldn&#39;t be bothered to think about it anymore, so I asked perplexity.ai to do it for me, expecting it to generate code that doesn&#39;t work but which maybe has a useful idea somewhere in it that I could use to make it work.</p> <p>This is what it generated:</p> <pre><code>use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*; use wasm_bindgen::JsCast; use web_sys::{HtmlTableElement, HtmlTableRowElement, Event}; use std::rc::Rc; use std::cell::RefCell; struct T { table: HtmlTableElement, } impl T { fn new(table: HtmlTableElement) -&gt; Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Self&gt;&gt; { Rc::new(RefCell::new(Self { table })) } fn add_row(self: &amp;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Self&gt;&gt;) { // Insert a new row at the end of the table let row = self.borrow().table.insert_row().unwrap(); // Add a cell for demonstration (optional) let cell = row.insert_cell().unwrap(); cell.set_inner_html(&quot;New row&quot;); // Clone Rc for the closure let self_clone = self.clone(); // Create the closure for the row click event let closure = Closure::wrap(Box::new(move |_event: Event| { self_clone.borrow().on_row_click(); }) as Box&lt;dyn FnMut(_)&gt;); // Attach the closure to the row&#39;s click event row.add_event_listener_with_callback(&quot;click&quot;, closure.as_ref().unchecked_ref()).unwrap(); // Prevent the closure from being dropped closure.forget(); } fn on_row_click(&amp;self) { web_sys::console::log_1(&amp;&quot;Row clicked!&quot;.into()); // Custom logic here } } </code></pre> <p>While it was still generating, I saw the signature of the <code>add_row</code> function and thought that I would just have to throw it away and figure something else out because it was generating nonsense. I tried it anyway and it didn&#39;t compile, but after getting rid of the <code>RefCell</code> (unnecessary here because there&#39;s no mutation), it worked!</p> <p>At this point I remembered seeing the &quot;arbitrary self types&quot; RFC a few years ago and looked it up to see if it ever got implemented and stabilized without me ever hearing anything about it, but it didn&#39;t.</p> <p>It turns out that <code>self</code> doesn&#39;t have to be <code>Self</code> or <code>&amp;Self</code>, you can use other types too, as long as they deref to <code>Self</code>. I&#39;ve been using rust for about 3.5 years now and I&#39;ve NEVER seen any code that uses anything other than <code>Self</code> or <code>&amp;Self</code> and never seen anyone even mention that it was possible.</p> <p>This allowed me to implement the table with row click event listeners by making a <code>TableInner</code> struct using functions that take <code>self: &amp;Rc&lt;Self&gt;</code> and then making a <code>Table</code> wrapper that contains an <code>Rc&lt;TableInner&gt;</code>. Then the event listeners work because I can just call <code>self.clone()</code> and move the cloned <code>Rc</code> into the event listener closure (if you have a better solution or a solution that doesn&#39;t leak memory, let me know (although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too important here because it&#39;s such a small amount of memory being leaked in my case)).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hpxvzhjfgb"> /u/hpxvzhjfgb </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1ucor/today_i_learned_that_the_type_of_self_can_be/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1ucor/today_i_learned_that_the_type_of_self_can_be/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am writing a game server in rust, but do not know what to do in case of certain errors. For context, when I did the same thing in nodejs, most of the time I did not worry about these things, but now I am forced to make the decision.</p> <p>For example, what should I do if a websocket message cannot get sent to the client due to some os/io error? If I retry, how many times? How fast? What about queuing? Currently, I disconnect the client. For crucial data, I exit the process.</p> <p>What do I do in case of an error at the websocket protocol level? Currently, I disconnect the client. I feel like disconnecting is ok since a client should not be sending invalid websocket messaages.</p> <p>I use tokio unbounded mpsc channels to communincate between the game loop and the task that accepts connections. What should I do if for whatever reason a message fails to send? A critical message is letting the acceptor task know that an id is freed when a client disconnects. Currently, I exit the process since having a zombie id is not an acceptable state. In fact most of the cases of a failed message send currently exit the process, although this has never occurred. Can tokio unbounded channels ever even fail to send if both sides are open?</p> <p>These are just some of the cases where I need to think about error handling, since ignoring the <code>Result</code> could result in invalid state. Furthermore, some things that I do in the case of an error lead to another <code>Result</code>, so it is important that the all possible combinations result in valid state.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zane_erebos"> /u/zane_erebos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1rmdy/handling_errors_in_game_server/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1rmdy/handling_errors_in_game_server/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I am currently hosting VSCode Server, from a Ubuntu VM on Proxmox, with 16GB total RAM. When I am working, I usually have 3 windows open so I can work on the 3 main code bases. The issue is, now that my project has gotten a little bigger, the Ubuntu VM crashes because VSCode Server is using too much memory, even if I provision 14GB memory to the Ubuntu VM only, it will crash. Besides this, VSCode Server has been very smooth and responsive. Anyways, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to move my IDE to my primary computer, which has an i9 and 64GB or RAM, and I though I would also move over to JetBrains Rust Rover. However, I have been very disappointed because I cannot even use Rust Rover, it it extremely laggy, I can barely type or scroll, and errors and warnings will not appear at all, or persist even when there is not an issue. To try and speed it up, I disabled Expand macros, and run external linter on the fly, I also disabled most of the default plugins, and I set the maximum heap size to 24GB, and it is still slow. Also I am running it on Ubuntu with GNOME. I hope this is a skill issue on my part, because I like the Rust Rover GUI and customization, and would like to get away from VSCode. I appreciate any help, thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kozlof"> /u/Kozlof </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1qtnd/rust_rover_laggy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k1qtnd/rust_rover_laggy/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But over time I liked it, and ended up deciding to transform it into something more professional. With the help of an experienced developer, I took the project to Phaser, and today it runs smoothly in the browser, ready for PC and cell phones.</p> <p>COME-COME is simple, retro arcade style, with that nostalgic feel reminiscent of Snake and Flappy Bird. The idea is to engage the player in the challenge of beating their own record, with power-ups, local rankings, and a pixel art look that makes everything more charming.</p> <p>I launched the game about two months ago. At first, it was kind of hidden, because I didn&#39;t have the money to publicize it. But now in April, I started promoting it organically in the gaming and dev communities, and the feedback was very positive. Between the 11th and 14th of April alone, there were more than 2000 new hits, all based on word of mouth.</p> <p>Here is the link to test the game: <a href="https://toinho-santos.itch.io/come-come">https://toinho-santos.itch.io/come-come</a></p> <p>Now I&#39;m looking for someone interested in licensing or buying the rights to COME-COME.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hiya all. Sharing my project for the first time publicly (outside of the Gophers #finland channel and a recent open-source meetup). I&#39;m the founder and CEO of Decombine. We&#39;ve open sourced the Decombine SLC and I&#39;d like to share it with you. </p> <p>Decombine SLC is a runtime and specification to automate contractual execution. It is completely written in Go. You can load in a contract template from Git, filesystem, etc., which orchestrates software actions based on a state configuration (good ole fashioned UML). We&#39;re releasing a CLI, the Go runtime, and a separate controller that can be installed on Kubernetes directly.</p> <p>This is a long article, talking about some of the <em>why</em> behind what we&#39;re doing. There is a &quot;dev mode&quot; you can enable on the blog article to directly see some context and code snippets. The GitHub is available here: <a href="https://github.com/decombine/slc">https://github.com/decombine/slc</a></p> <p>Decombine SLC is the result of a couple years of PoCs, experiments, R&amp;D, etc. I&#39;m still cleaning up the repository and working on shipping the Decombine SLC Kubernetes controller as a separate helm installation.</p> <p>If this sounds interesting to you, like something you&#39;d like to work on, I&#39;d love to have a chat about onboarding contributors. </p> <p><strong>Article content:</strong></p> <p>We click accept. We&#39;re not entirely sure what we&#39;ve just agreed to. What happens now? It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess. There are promising hopes that this is just the thing that will solve our problems, but we&#39;re not really sure. We&#39;re willing to take a risk or two to get over this hump and get back to work. Haven&#39;t been in this exact situation? Well, I don&#39;t believe you. Most of us interact with hundreds or thousands of individual agreements every single day.</p> <p>Most agreements are small, but they&#39;re still impactful to our lives. It&#39;s the warranty on the coffee machine, the insurance on our motorcycle, the video game we purchased through a service, or the assurance that the driver picking us up is not wanted in 34 states. For most of us, we click accept, and we hope for the best.</p> <p><strong>A better way? Meet the Decombine Smart Legal Contract (SLC)</strong></p> <h1>1. What is a Smart Legal Contract?</h1> <p>A Smart Legal Contract (SLC) is the concept of a legal agreement that includes some kind of machine-readable format. It is difficult to pin down an exact definition, since it doesn&#39;t exist as a widely accepted or even attempted standard. Not necessarily for lack of trying. A lot of very smart people have been working in this problem domain for a very long time. Much has been explored. Custom programming languages, domain specific languages, tooling for lawyers, blockchains, and more. Almost all of it has struggled with the same problem: there&#39;s no reason to upset the apple cart. We have a system that works. We click accept, and we hope for the best.</p> <p>Legal boilerplate isn&#39;t going anywhere, and that&#39;s just fine. Our lawyers need comfortable vacation homes. For agreements that don&#39;t require getting our legal teams on the horn, we think the Decombine SLC has something to offer. Our approach is fairly simple: we focus on what is supposed to happen during the lifecycle of our contract. We create a template to describe it, and then plug in software to act, or react, to what happens. Natural language legal text hasn&#39;t gone away, and it won&#39;t, but now there&#39;s a lot less guesswork about what happens next. In summary, that&#39;s the idea behind the Decombine Smart Legal Contract.</p> <h1>2. What is Decombine?</h1> <p>We&#39;re a small startup, part American, part Finnish. We&#39;ve been working for a few years on research and development around the future of agreement. Much of those lessons are going right into the Decombine SLC. The Decombine SLC is open source so we&#39;re making a calculated bet that it&#39;s the right thing to do, and that there exists a viable future in acting as a trusted partner to help you operate your SLC.</p> <p><strong>The competitive advantage of Decombine SLC</strong></p> <p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p> <p>Decombine SLC have been designed with the leading cloud native interoperability standards in mind. There are no proprietary standards or software required to use or create SLC. SLC leverage Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects and tools like Kubernetes, Open Policy Agent (OPA), Cloud Events, and Flux. Furthermore, this means that SLC are going to be a safe bet for the future, ensuring that each Contract has long term viability for integrating to solve the most demanding and complex business problems.</p> <p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p> <p>Although it may sound complex, the Decombine SLC is deceptively simple. Each SLC is defined using one of multiple template formats that are considered de facto standards for communicating configuration (JSON, YAML, TOML). Provided you understand the process you&#39;re templating, it shouldn&#39;t take more than a few minutes to create a template. Once the template is created, you can then include any number of software workloads that are used in the SLC. Decombine SLC currently supports software that can be run on Kubernetes - so anything that uses Docker.</p> <p><strong>Transparency</strong> </p> <p>Trust is getting much harder to come by, and for pretty good reasons. It used to be that everyone on the Internet was the FBI. Simpler times. Unfortunately, those days are gone. The Internet matured from simple corporate naivete to surveillance capitalism and is heading full steam for something more complex. The bar to overcome skepticism is only going to get higher as the proliferation of agents and models leads to opaque results. Transparency is about to make another comeback.</p> <p>Encapsulating your service as a SLC means you are standing behind your work. You have done the work of outlining key events, expected outcomes, and are ready to back them up. Your service doesn&#39;t have to be open source, but it can be. Most importantly, people know what to expect. This is about to be a huge competitive advantage, for both humans and machines alike.</p> <p>Every SLC has a series of states. Just like in the real world, a contract can only ever be in a single state. For example, it can&#39;t be both valid and invalid. In order for it to be valid, there are probably very specific conditions that need to be met. The same could be said for a service. If you want to access a service, you need to meet certain conditions.</p> <p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p> <p>Just because you&#39;re a technology leader doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re ready to jump into the deep end of innovation for your contracts. Decombine SLC don&#39;t care what kind of contract you have, whether it is a Word document, PDF, image file, or something else. Decombine SLC are designed to be agnostic of the related natural language legal text. On the other hand, if you&#39;re ready for something more capable, you can use the Decombine SLC to create a contract that is fully machine readable.</p> <p>Accord Project is an open source community under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation working on the bleeding edge of complex data and document modeling. Decombine SLC plan to natively integrate with models created from Accord Project&#39;s tooling and libraries so that you can integrate structured data models into your natural language legal contracts to support the most advanced use cases and customization possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheFilterJustLeaves"> /u/TheFilterJustLeaves </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://decombine.com/blog/introducing-decombine-slc">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k1hcqm/introducing_decombine_smart_legal_contracts/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is misleading and breaks RESTful behavior expectations.</li> <li>Uploading the wrong file format doesn&#39;t return 422 When uploading a file that doesn&#39;t meet the required MIME type or file extension, Gin doesn‚Äôt give a 422 Unprocessable Entity or a meaningful error‚Äîit often just silently fails or returns 400 with a vague message.</li> <li>Malformed body causes confusing EOF errors If you send a form (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) instead of JSON (application/json) to a handler expecting JSON, Gin throws an EOF error rather than returning a friendly message or a clear 400/415 error. This makes debugging painful and non-intuitive for beginners and seasoned devs alike.</li> </ul> <p>Proposal:</p> <p>Forking Gin:</p> <p>Should the community consider forking Gin to ensure timely updates, faster issue resolutions, and active maintenance?</p> <p>Collaborative Effort:</p> <p>Would it be better for the Gin maintainers to open up the project further, allowing external contributors to assist with:</p> <p>Reviewing and merging pull requests.</p> <p>Addressing security vulnerabilities and dependency updates.</p> <p>Performing more regular releases.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yourgolangguy"> /u/yourgolangguy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k1a7l0/should_we_fork_gin_or_encourage_more_maintainer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k1a7l0/should_we_fork_gin_or_encourage_more_maintainer/">[comments]</a></span></div>
