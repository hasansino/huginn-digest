            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My daughter and I like to watch creators on YouTube that do mechanical engineering and blacksmithing projects. She‚Äôs 5 and she asks a lot of questions and really seems to enjoy watching people do these things.</p> <p>The creators themselves always seem like they enjoy it, too. It isn‚Äôt like it‚Äôs all easy for them; you can see that a lot of time passes, they talk about the bad hours, days, and months, the things breaking, the not being sure what went wrong and feeling stupid when they figure it out. It can be brutal, but ultimately at the end of it you can see that they feel really accomplished.</p> <p>I love game development, and I especially love coding. I love it so much that I actually have to be careful and watch the clock because I can spend hours doing it and think I only spent 20 minutes. I even love the tedium. The end of it always makes it all worth it.</p> <p>I‚Äôve been trying to find something like maybe devlogs from people that make a few small games a year, or people that frequently make things for game jams, and sure I found a few of them, but in order to find them I had to sift through tons and tons of videos from people that were criticizing other creators, saying that the way others make games is wrong, that some games aren‚Äôt real games, and so many other things that are such a stark contrast to the mechanical engineering videos.</p> <p>So, I mean this honestly, I get that the industry is awful and there are terrible managers, that reviewers don‚Äôt actually know anything about games, that audiences sometimes have bad taste, and all that, but if people are so disillusioned by all of that then why do they do it on their own, and why do they do it to the standard of such miserable people?</p> <p>Where‚Äôs the Simone Giertz of programming, the ones of us that proudly make terrible games that are labors of love, and that maybe are spaghetti coded but get better and better as time goes on?</p> <p>I‚Äôm not saying that they aren‚Äôt out there. I just want to know where my fellow lovers of the craft are. The people who are more focused on the fact that we get to make something that people play with than we are on how perfect something is that only a few others would ever end up seeing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Signal-Passage-4104"> /u/Signal-Passage-4104 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oekxb7/do_you_love_game_development/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oekxb7/do_you_love_game_development/">[comments]</a></span></div>

My hobbies are drawing, writing, and playing videogames. So, naturally, the idea of making one myself took root in my head. </p> <p>I don&#39;t have much knowledge of anything related to video game making, just some programming languages I was taught during my degree. I still have a lot to learn! </p> <p>My first idea was to make an RPG, with a pretty unusual gameplay mode, animations and allat. If Toby Fox could do it, why can&#39;t I? But recently I came to the idea that making a VN would be a much more in line with my current knowledge (and way more suitable as a first project).</p> <p>I&#39;ve been snooping around with Renpy, but I feel like using it is like... the easy way out. </p> <p>I really want to learn more about it, I just don&#39;t know where to start! </p> <p>If anyone has any advice on my options, my first project, or even Renpy, please leave it in the comments. Any help appreciated. As the title indicates, I&#39;m a bit dumb.</p> <p>English isn&#39;t my first language, so sorry if I made any mistakes! :3</p> <p>EDIT: Woa, I didn&#39;t expect this post to have more than two comments.

I started alone and eventually was joined by someone else who was interested by the idea. I had received a lot of bad comments when I posted on Reddit and it was hard to overcome these and I almost abandon multiple times and had to stop multiple times. Recently, as the game started to get an incredible polish level, members of a community of a popular YouTuber of a similar game I‚Äôm doing discovered us and brought a lot of his members in our discord at the time we were seeking people to test the game. We suddenly got a lot of recognition for what we were doing and lot of positive comments. And just for that, all the pain and the wait was so worth it. I never imagined people could get that interested in what I was doing. I must say I feel like I sometimes don‚Äôt deserve that much attention because there‚Äôs still lot of bugs but it is truly incredible to have people like the game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/XavBell38388"> /u/XavBell38388 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oedgfk/its_worth_the_pain/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oedgfk/its_worth_the_pain/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is a lot of latent pressure, manifested as judgement of other games, worrying about wishlists and conversion, struggling to manage a full-time job, family, etc...</p> <p>For a hobby, this is an unhealthy outlook. You shouldn&#39;t &quot;struggle&quot; to manage work, family and hobbies. Hobbies should organically fill up the gaps in your real life, ideally in an enriching manner. They shouldn&#39;t compete for attention. If you don&#39;t do it for a week, you should feel an itch, <strong>not</strong> a fear of failure.</p> <p>If they are competing for attention, then you have ascribed some greater aspiration to your hobby. This is a damaging mindset to be in. Your game will obviously not match the quality, reception and results of a professionally made game, <em>even if said game is made by a solo developer\</em>*. They are a professional. This acceptance is necessary for any hobby to become a healthy and fulfiling part of life.</p> <p>If the &quot;dream&quot; is the fun part of the hobby, perhaps that is a signal of some deficiency in your real job. Eg. lack of validation, stagnation, etc. which are a part of the ebb and flow of a career and wear us all down. But - generally speaking - it will be healthier for you to fix that headfirst. Your hobby cannot fill those shoes.</p> <p>For any hobby, I believe the wisdom to go by is - do it because just the act of doing it is fun enough. If not, then switch hobbies.</p> <p><em>\</em>and even then, professional solo developers are astonishingly rare exceptions. its like being in the NBA at 5&#39;8. please don&#39;t fall for the fairy tales.*</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dense_Scratch_6925"> /u/Dense_Scratch_6925 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oe8ym9/please_be_realistic_about_gamedev_in_your_life/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oe8ym9/please_be_realistic_about_gamedev_in_your_life/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When you post your game around (especially on Reddit), you&#39;re bound to get at least a few negative comments regardless of what your game is or how good it is. It happens, and it&#39;s easy to take their attacks or snarky remarks personally, but you must always keep in mind that:</p> <p><strong>YOU ARE SELLING SOMETHING</strong></p> <p>If the negative commenters have the confidence or lack the respect to leave a comment like that in the first place, then they will <em>never buy your game</em>, so quit trying to convert them.</p> <p>Obviously, some comments present an opportunity to fluff up your title, like a commenter saying that it looks too similar to another game, then you can leave a professional response detailing what sets yours apart and makes it unique. There are definitely chances to use their hate or ignorance to your advantage, but the key point is to remember that you are only interacting with this void because you want them to buy your game.</p> <p>The majority of bad comments will simply not be worth your time, so don&#39;t bother responding and especially don&#39;t dwell on them or take them personal. </p> <p>You made something that took <em>a lot</em> of time and effort, and you stuck with it so long that you can actually show it off to people, and they can actually buy/download it and enjoy it. That&#39;s awesome! Don&#39;t get caught up on the ones that are only there to hurt you--it&#39;s never worth it. </p> <p>EDIT: This isn&#39;t regarding <em>feedback</em>, this is about the comments your marketing posts get by people who have never, and will never play your game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Schwanz_Hintern64"> /u/Schwanz_Hintern64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oe66j9/marketing_reminder_dont_argue_with_people_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oe66j9/marketing_reminder_dont_argue_with_people_that/">[comments]</a></span></div>

See <code>examples/examples/00_tracing.rs</code>.</li> <li>**<code>borsa-types</code> Crate:** Shared types, errors, and config (<code>BorsaConfig</code>, strategies) are now centralized, making dependencies cleaner and enabling config serialization (<code>serde</code>).</li> <li><strong>New Connector: <code>borsa-alphavantage</code>:</strong> An experimental, <strong>best-effort</strong> connector for Alpha Vantage (API key required)!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Rustaceans,</p> <p>We recently open-sourced a small but fun project called <a href="https://echokit.dev/">EchoKit</a> ‚Äî a voice AI agent framework built on ESP32 with Rust. I‚Äôd love to get some feedback and hear if anyone else here has tried similar projects using Rust for embedded or voice AI systems.</p> <h1>What is EchoKit?</h1> <p>EchoKit is a fun voice AI device that can chat with you out of the box. You speak to the device, and it responds to you ‚Äî also in voice.</p> <ul> <li>Client: an ESP32 board with a mini speaker and a small screen.</li> <li>Server: a WebSocket-based backend supporting both <ul> <li>modular pipelines like ASR ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí TTS, and</li> <li>end-to-end model pipelines (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI Realtime).</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Both the firmware and server are written in Rust.</p> <h1>How it works</h1> <p>The diagram below shows the basic architecture of EchoKit.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/msonzk1exuwf1.png?width=3350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438feadf4bd3c1a61bee6a2ab5b66809ceea9fd8">https://preview.redd.it/msonzk1exuwf1.png?width=3350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438feadf4bd3c1a61bee6a2ab5b66809ceea9fd8</a></p> <p>Essentially, the ESP32 streams audio input to the server, which handles recognition, reasoning, and response generation ‚Äî then sends the voice output back to the device. We also added MCP support on the server side, so you can use voice to control the real world.</p> <h1>Why Rust?</h1> <p>We‚Äôre using the community-maintained <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc">esp-idf-svc</a> SDK, which offers async-friendly APIs for many hardware operations.</p> <p>Our team is primarily made up of Rust developers ‚Äî so writing firmware in Rust felt natural. A note from our developer, Using Rust makes him feel safe because he won&#39;t write code that may cause memory leaks.</p> <p>However, most hardware drivers are still in C, so we had to mix in a bit of C code. But integrating the two languages on ESP32 turned out to be quite smooth.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre curious, check out the source code here üëá</p> <ul> <li>Firmware: <a href="https://github.com/second-state/echokit_box">https://github.com/second-state/echokit_box</a></li> <li>Server: <a href="https://github.com/second-state/echokit_server">https://github.com/second-state/echokit_server</a></li> </ul> <p>Along with the server and firmware, we also have <a href="https://github.com/second-state/silero_vad_server">VAD server</a> and <a href="https://github.com/second-state/gsv_tts">streaming GPT-SOVITs API server</a> written in Rust.</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts and contributions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Melinda_McCartney"> /u/Melinda_McCartney </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oe2t4b/building_a_local_voice_ai_agent_on_esp32_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oe2t4b/building_a_local_voice_ai_agent_on_esp32_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I 100% do not need Rust speed, any language would work for my use case, even Ruby. I would pick Rust because of the type system. I like ADT, immutability, Enum, and Result/Option. But I found that Rust code becomes really verbose because of the borrow checker and lifetimes, and this left me wondering why use Rust for an Web API instead of something like Java or Kotlin? Or if we get into more strict type systems, Scala or Haskell?<br/> I&#39;m actually very interested in this comparison with Haskell and Scala because I truly believe that Pure FP produces better code, but I don&#39;t know if the huge effort to do it is worth the cost and maybe Rust is a good compromise.</p> <p>From the mainstream languages I would say that Rust is likely the one with the best type system.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ecstatic-Panic3728"> /u/Ecstatic-Panic3728 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oe0oss/is_rust_suitable_for_non_systems_development/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oe0oss/is_rust_suitable_for_non_systems_development/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I was wondering if you guys had any advice for testing race conditions in a sql database. my team wants me to mock the database using sqlmock to see if our code can handle that use case, but i dont think that sqlmock supports concurrency like that. any advice would be great thanks :)))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooMacarons8178"> /u/SnooMacarons8178 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oe4b60/testing_race_conditions_in_sql_database/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oe4b60/testing_race_conditions_in_sql_database/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>Over the past few months, I&#39;ve been working on a pure Go cryptography library because I kept running into the same issue: the standard library is great, but it doesn&#39;t cover some of the newer algorithms I needed for a project. No CGO wrappers, no external dependencies, just Go&#39;s stdlib and a lot of copy-pasting from RFCs.</p> <p>Yesterday I finally pushed <strong>v1.0</strong> to GitHub. It&#39;s called cryptonite-go. (<a href="https://github.com/AeonDave/cryptonite-go">https://github.com/AeonDave/cryptonite-go</a>)</p> <p>I needed:</p> <ul> <li>Lightweight AEADs for an IoT prototype (ASCON-128a ended up being perfect)</li> <li>Modern password hashing (Argon2id + scrypt, without CGO pain)</li> <li>Consistent APIs so I could swap ChaCha20 for AES-GCM without rewriting everything</li> </ul> <p>The stdlib covers the basics well, but once you need NIST LwC winners or SP 800-185 constructs, you&#39;re stuck hunting for CGO libs or reimplementing everything.</p> <p>After evenings/weekends and dead ends (with some help from couple AIs) i released it. It covers many algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>AEADs: ASCON-128a (NIST lightweight winner), Xoodyak, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-GCM-SIV</li> <li>Hashing: SHA3 family, BLAKE2b/s, KMAC (SP 800-185)</li> <li>KDFs: HKDF variants, PBKDF2, Argon2id, scrypt</li> <li>Signatures/Key Exchange: Ed25519, ECDSA-P256, X25519, P-256/P-384</li> <li>Bonus: HPKE support + some post-quantum hybrids</li> </ul> <p>The APIs are dead simple ‚Äì everything follows the same patterns:</p> <pre><code>// AEAD a := aead.NewAscon128() ct, _ := a.Encrypt(key, nonce, nil, []byte(&quot;hello world&quot;)) // Hash h := hash.NewBLAKE2bHasher() digest := h.Hash([]byte(&quot;hello&quot;)) // KDF d := kdf.NewArgon2idWithParams(1, 64*1024, 4) key, _ := d.Derive(kdf.DeriveParams{ Secret: []byte(&quot;password&quot;), Salt: []byte(&quot;salt&quot;), Length: 32, }) </code></pre> <p>I was surprised how well pure Go performs (i added some benchs)</p> <ul> <li>BLAKE2b: ~740 MB/s</li> <li>ASCON-128a: ~220 MB/s (great for battery-powered stuff)</li> <li>ChaCha20: ~220 MB/s with <strong>zero allocations</strong></li> <li>Etc</li> </ul> <h1>The good, the bad, and the ugly</h1> <p><strong>Good</strong>: 100% test coverage, Wycheproof tests, known-answer vectors from RFCs. Runs everywhere Go runs. <strong>Bad</strong>: No independent security audit yet.<br/> <strong>Ugly</strong>: Some algorithms (like Deoxys-II) are slower than I&#39;d like, but they&#39;re there for completeness. Also i know some algos are stinky but i want to improve it.</p> <p>What now? I&#39;d love some feedback:</p> <ul> <li>Does the API feel natural?</li> <li>Missing algorithms you need?</li> <li>Better ways to structure the packages?</li> <li>Performance regressions vs stdlib?</li> </ul> <p>Definitely <strong>not production-ready</strong> without review, but hoping it helps someone avoid the CGO rabbit hole I fell into. </p> <p>... and happy coding!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aeondave"> /u/Aeondave </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oe2wwp/go_cryptography_library/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oe2wwp/go_cryptography_library/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>, </p> <p>If you&#39;re building LLM apps at scale, your gateway shouldn&#39;t be the bottleneck. That‚Äôs why we built <strong>Bifrost</strong>, a high-performance, fully self-hosted LLM gateway that‚Äôs optimized for speed, scale, and flexibility, built from scratch in Go.</p> <p>A few highlights for devs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Ultra-low overhead</strong>: mean request handling overhead is just <strong>11¬µs per request at 5K RPS</strong>, and it scales linearly under high load</li> <li><strong>Adaptive load balancing</strong>: automatically distributes requests across providers and keys based on latency, errors, and throughput limits</li> <li><strong>Cluster mode resilience</strong>: nodes synchronize in a peer-to-peer network, so failures don‚Äôt disrupt routing or lose data</li> <li><strong>Drop-in OpenAI-compatible API</strong>: integrate quickly with existing Go LLM projects</li> <li><strong>Observability</strong>: Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, logs, and plugin support</li> <li><strong>Extensible</strong>: middleware architecture for custom monitoring, analytics, or routing logic</li> <li><strong>Full multi-provider support</strong>: OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure, and more</li> </ul> <p>Bifrost is designed to behave like a core infra service. It adds minimal overhead at extremely high load (e.g. ~11¬µs at 5K RPS) and gives you fine-grained control across providers, monitoring, and transport.</p> <p>Repo and docs here if you want to try it out or contribute: <a href="https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost">https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost</a></p> <p>Would love to hear from Go devs who‚Äôve built high-performance API gateways or similar LLM tools.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dinkinflika0"> /u/dinkinflika0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odus0x/building_a_highperformance_llm_gateway_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odus0x/building_a_highperformance_llm_gateway_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>
