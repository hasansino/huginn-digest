We run big data pipelines with C++ dependencies and a need for highly efficient code. The company as a whole uses lots of Go, just not in our area.</p> <p>But we&#39;ve got a bunch of new infrastructure and tooling work to do, like admin jobs to run other things, and tracking and visualizing completed work. I want to do it in Go, and I really think it&#39;s a good fit. I&#39;ve already written a few things, but nothing critical.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been asked to give a tech talk to the team so they can be more effective &quot;at reviewing Go code,&quot; with the undertone of &quot;convince us this is worth it.&quot;</p> <p>I honestly feel like I have too much to say, but no key point. To me, Go is an obvious win over C++ for tooling.</p> <p>Do y&#39;all have any resources, slide decks, whatever helped you convince your team?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>At the company I work for, many internal processes (especially around testing and approvals before a new release) are still pretty document-heavy. One of the key requirements is that we need to submit a formal test report in PDF format. There‚Äôs even a company-mandated template for it.</p> <p>This is a bit at odds with Go‚Äôs usual tooling, where test output is mostly for devs and CI systems, not formal documentation. Right now, I‚Äôm finding myself either hacking together scripts that parse go test -json, or manually writing summaries, neither of which is ideal or scalable.</p> <p>So, I‚Äôm wondering: - How do others handle this? - Are there any tools out there that can generate structured test reports (PDF or otherwise) from Go test output? - Does anyone else have to deal with this kind of documentation-driven process?</p> <p>I‚Äôve actually started working on a small tool to bridge this gap, something that reads Go test results and outputs a clean, customizable PDF report, possibly using templates. If this is something others need too, I‚Äôd be happy to consider open-sourcing it.</p> <p>Would love to hear how others are tackling this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zerrox_"> /u/Zerrox_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m3i92q/how_do_you_handle_test_reports_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m3i92q/how_do_you_handle_test_reports_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

To address these issues but still leverage the graphviz technology as I created a thin yaml shim which essentially compiles to graphviz. The main argument is the Yaml is more ui friendly to define in many use cases </p> <p>I was able to do this as a front end only app even though I used Go by using wasm to create js bindings. It&#39;s fully cross platform so all functionality would work as an iOS app or android app.</p> <p>I think this could have many use cases like visualizing agent workflows or creating system design diagrams easily. Check out the templates for some samples.

I&#39;ve written most of my personal and school projects in C, so I can say I am quite confident in my choice of Rust as my new passion language. I grow weary of dumb memory bugs, but I still enjoy the practice of writing C. My internship + job have both mostly revolved around writing, maintaining, and upgrading legacy C code. I&#39;ve enjoyed it, but needless to say it&#39;s been a bit challenging at times!</p> <p>My lead has been interested in introducing Rust for some time. He and I had discussed that my beginner-level Rust experience when I first started last summer, so in January we made the decision to introduce the language in the form of a brand-new codebase. This has been an incredibly fun and fulfilling learning experience, but not without hiccups; we have had more refactoring than is probably necessary.</p> <p>My question: What are some wise words that more experienced professional Rust developers can provide? I have been given a steep responsibility in helping to integrate this new language into a team that traditionally focuses more on stability than quick change. Now that I have developed some good (and bad) habits, I am ready to listen and act on external feedback.</p> <p><strong>TLDR: As an professional experienced Rust developer, what would you tell yourself as a beginner about designing, writing, and maintaining Rust code?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kadealicious"> /u/kadealicious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m3d4s1/beginnerish_rust_dev_introducing_rust_into/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m3d4s1/beginnerish_rust_dev_introducing_rust_into/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Burn, a deep learning framework &amp; tensor library built in Rust, reached two important performance milestones with the latest release.</p> <h1>Milestone 1: State-of-the-Art Multi-Platform Matrix Multiplication Kernels</h1> <p>The latest Burn release introduces a sophisticated matrix multiplication kernel engine that rivals the performance of cuBLAS and CUTLASS while supporting a wider range of GPUs. This was a huge amount of work and a task that most would recommend against doing, but we strongly believed we needed to nail the most important part of a deep learning framework ourselves for maximum performance everywhere: fused kernels all the way on all platforms with no reliance on proprietary or third-party binaries.</p> <p>We&#39;ve published an <a href="https://burn.dev/blog/sota-multiplatform-matmul/">in-depth technical post with benchmarks</a>, and we&#39;re happy to answer questions and comments here.</p> <h1>Milestone 2: Dynamic Graph Flexibility with Static Graph Fusion Capability</h1> <p>This release refines our tensor compiler engine, introducing a novel search mechanism to optimize dynamic graphs. The new approach reorders operations to maximize optimization opportunities, including dead code elimination, and improves resilience to varying tensor operation sequences. This alleviates previous constraints, as it introduces graph manipulation and optimization within eager execution, which once again relies heavily on the type system of Rust and its ownership rules.</p> <p>Some important optimizations are not yet implemented, such as broadcasted fuse-on-read and fuse-on-write multi-reduce kernels, which would automatically optimize softmax, batch-norm, layer-norm, and other common deep learning functions without code changes. Right now, we fuse most element-wise operations, reductions, and matrix multiplications with dynamic shapes on any tensor layout.</p> <h1>Improved Reliability</h1> <p>Burn 0.18.0 sets a new standard for reliability. We&#39;ve expanded our CI testing suite to address multi-threading, lazy evaluation, and async execution issues, ensuring robust performance across an increasing number of supported platforms. Additionally, we&#39;re implementing automated performance regression testing to maintain stability as the platform evolves.</p> <p>See the full <a href="https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/releases/tag/v0.18.0">release note</a>.</p> <h1>CubeCL 0.6.0</h1> <p>As with most new Burn releases, we&#39;re also releasing CubeCL at the same time. The new release includes a ton of bug fixes, new features for autotune, and a big project refactor featuring kernel crates <code>cubecl-matmul</code>, <code>cubecl-convolution</code>, <code>cubecl-reduce</code>, and <code>cubecl-random</code>. We plan on adding more, such as <code>cubecl-attention</code> to speed up transformer models. We&#39;re also trying to improve the documentation and usability of CubeCL by itself, starting with a new <a href="https://burn.dev/books/cubecl">CubeCL user book</a>. Let us know if you would like a separate Reddit post dedicated to CubeCL, or if a section in the Burn releases post is sufficient.</p> <p>The release note is available <a href="https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl/releases/tag/v0.6.0">here</a>.</p> <p>This release represents a major leap forward in performance, reliability, and optimization, delivering a more robust and efficient experience for everyone. Stay tuned, as we have another open-source project releasing in the coming weeks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ksyiros"> /u/ksyiros </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m37b0d/burn_0180_important_performance_milestones/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m37b0d/burn_0180_important_performance_milestones/">[comments]</a></span></div>
