            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Github link : <a href="https://github.com/Achno/gowall">https://github.com/Achno/gowall</a></p> <p>Docs: (visual examples,tips,use gowall with scripts): <a href="https://achno.github.io/gowall-docs/">https://achno.github.io/gowall-docs/</a></p> <p>Hello all, after a 6 month slumber i have awoken and released <code>gowall v.0.2.3</code> ,the swiss army knife for image processing, with 2 more core features <strong>OCR</strong> (Traditional OCR, Visual Language Models and hybrid methods) and <strong>Image Compression</strong></p> <h5>First Package Management.</h5> <p>Arch (AUR), Fedora (COPR) updated to the latest version since im the maintainer, binaries for all OS in the <a href="https://github.com/Achno/gowall/releases">release section</a>. Obviously you could build it from source see docs for building from source.</p> <p>All others (MacOS,Void,NixOS) are not updated yet.</p> <h5>Feature TLDR</h5> <ul> <li> Convert Wallpaper&#39;s theme ‚Äì Recolor an image to match your favorite + (Custom) themes (Catppuccin etc ...) <ul> <li> <strong>OCR</strong> (Traditional OCR, Visual Language Models and hybrid methods) &lt;-- New</li> <li> <strong>Image Compression</strong> (png,webp,jpg,jpeg) with both lossy and lossless methods when possible &lt;-- New</li> </ul></li> <li><p>AI Image Upscaling </p></li> <li><p>Unix pipes/redirection - Read from <code>stdin</code> and write to <code>stdout</code> </p></li> <li><p>Convert Icon&#39;s theme (svg,ico) </p></li> <li><p>Image to pixel art</p></li> <li><p>Replace a specific color in an image </p></li> <li><p>Create a gif from images </p></li> <li><p>Extact color palette</p></li> <li><p>Change Image format</p></li> <li><p>Invert image colors</p></li> <li><p>Draw on the Image - Draw borders,grids on the image </p></li> <li><p>Remove the background of the image</p></li> <li><p>Effects (Mirror,Flip,Grayscale,change brightness and more to come)</p></li> <li><p>Daily wallpapers</p></li> </ul> <p>See <a href="https://github.com/Achno/gowall/releases/tag/v0.2.3">Changelog</a></p> <p>Overall a pretty sweet update if i say so myself, something to keep in mind is that OCR is still in Alpha. I very very highly recommend you checkout the docs escpecially for OCR to get you familiar with the features like <code>schemas</code> and change the <code>rate limits</code> accordingly since i internationally cap the OCR performance for reasons explained in the docs.</p> <p>I also made an lossy png compression algo which is better than pngquant in terms of compression to your image looking the same if you look it from afar (obviously much slower than pngquant), but if you take your head and place it right next to your screen you can see flaws which pngquant doesn&#39;t have. Thats why i haven&#39;t released it in this update, i&#39;m going to try to see if i can improve anything to make it less noticable.</p> <p>I also might improve the image background removal if i can get a pre-trained model working with onnx. Well until next time, see ya.</p> <p>Note : CGO dependencies are not fun when you trying to compile everything to binary to distribute.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FormationHeaven"> /u/FormationHeaven </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o4qg8w/gowall_v023_the_ocr_and_image_compression_update/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o4qg8w/gowall_v023_the_ocr_and_image_compression_update/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;m excited to share a project I&#39;ve been building: <a href="http://chamber.techrail.in">Chamber</a>, a cross-platform encrypted file-vault tool.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I created a new encrypted file-vault tool (keeps many files in encrypted form inside a single file) which works on multiple platforms (Windows,Linux,Mac), is pretty easy to use, allows remote access to the files over the web and disallows anyone (including the host machine&#39;s admins) without the right password from looking into the file contents stored inside the vault. </p> <h2>Some background</h2> <p>After working on different personal projects, homelab setups and servers (both VPS and cloud), I realized a couple of things: </p> <ol> <li>The most <em>immediate</em> requirement that I always faced after setting up a new server was to store/transfer files to the server. </li> <li>I am paranoid (self-realisation). While most VPS providers do talk about &quot;Shared Responsibility&quot; model and promise that they do not look inside my data, I could never trust them.</li> </ol> <p>So I started looking into solutions that allowed me to store files encrypted, allowed me to access them easily without the typical setup ritual and was more like plug-and-play. I was already used to Encrypted DMG files on my MacBook and was happy. But the moment I wanted something that was cross platform, it was cumbersome. The worse part was - what worked on Linux did not always work on macOS. Windows was another nightmare; although I am not regular on Windows, sometimes I do have to deal with it.</p> <p>The trigger point of this idea was actually when I tried to download and use an Encrypted DMG file I had uploaded to cloud on a relative&#39;s Windows PC and use it. After about a month of digging, I realised how difficult things are when I wanted to go cross-platform with encrypted files with possibility of easy remote access to those.</p> <p>That&#39;s why I built Chamber. The core idea is to remove complexity so one can focus on getting and storing files quickly and easily with an assurance that someone else, no matter who won&#39;t be accessing those files easily.</p> <h2>What makes Chamber different?</h2> <p>Like I have stated already, Chamber is an encrypted file-vault tool. Of course it is not the first ever and there are other tools since already out there. So why did I take the pain to make it (it took me 3+ months)? There are many things but the top 3 are these:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Easy-to-Use Web Interface</strong>: Unlike many other tools that are CLI-only, Chamber runs a web server (and tries to open a browser tab). It provides a clean UI for creating and managing vault and the files within without needing to perform additional setups. On local, you can simply &quot;download and run&quot;. That being said, there is a mimimal set of commands available via CLI to let you store and extract your files from within the vault file (can be useful in case your computer is stuck in recovery mode or something).</li> <li><strong>Truly Cross-Platform</strong>: It is written in Go. Chamber is compiled into single binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS. There are no dependencies to manage, and no more environment installations (e.g. Ruby, node, python, JVM) making it simple to deploy on almost any machine. It is also available on Docker. Right now, I am distributing binaries for 4 platforms - Windows-AMD64, macOS-ARM64(Apple Silicon) and Linux(ARM64 and AMD64).</li> <li><strong>Zero-Peek Hosting &amp; Server Security</strong>: This is a major design choice. When you self-host a server or homelab, the risk of a malicious user/script or admin accessing your files is a concern. None of the existing tools that I encountered allowed me to both encrypt my files and access them without mounting them on the machine. Chamber solves this by not mounting the vault file in the traditional sense. It handles everything internally, so the vault contents are never exposed on the file system. This I believe is a great solution for protecting sensitive data on shared machines, VPS, or homelab environment. So you can host it yourself (it exposes a web UI) but others on the machine can&#39;t peek into your vault contents (because it is not mounted and thus, files are not available for typical browsing).</li> </ul> <p><em>A note about zero-peek hosting</em>: As of now, I am not handling SSL termination within Chamber. I assume most people already use something like Caddy or Nginx for doing so. So that part is left to the user. Also, in most of the cases, a homelab environment might already have an extensive security setup but I being a lazy guy wanted to have something which required near-zero setups except setting up a reverse proxy.</p> <h2>Why did I choose Go for this?</h2> <p>Go was the perfect fit for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Single Binary Distribution</strong>: The ability to produce a single, static binary that runs on any major OS without needing a separate runtime was critical for the &quot;download and run&quot; goal. It also made Docker setups much easier. The cross-platform behavior without needing to install any runtime while still being super easy to program in is the biggest reason here.</li> <li><strong>Built-in Web Server, embed and concurrency</strong>: Go&#39;s <code>net/http</code> package is robust. The encapsulation provided by <code>go:embed</code> is a godsend too. In addition, if I ever wanted to scale it to handle more than one connection, I know there would be no major hurdles (I have seen RoR, my other favorite lang/framework cry with 5-8 parallel requests). </li> <li><strong>I love go</strong>: People build projects in all sorts of languages and of course, any other language could also have been used. But I have been using Go for the better part of last 6 years; to the point where any other language just doesn&#39;t appeal enough to me. I mean I can say a 100 things about why go was a great choice but I guess this community doesn&#39;t need to re-read all the praise.</li> </ul> <p><strong>I‚Äôd love to get your feedback and thoughts on this.</strong> You can find the source code <a href="http://forge.techrail.in/techrail/chamber">here</a> and the website is <a href="http://chamber.techrail.in">here</a>.</p> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vaibhav-kaushal"> /u/vaibhav-kaushal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o4kpuc/announcing_chamber_a_simple_crossplatform/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o4kpuc/announcing_chamber_a_simple_crossplatform/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I would like to post here to share with all of you a project I made to simplify localization in Rust, at least for me. Prior to creating this crate, I was using the <a href="https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/fluent-templates"><code>fluent_templates</code></a> crate. My disagreement with the crate is its complexity, lack of support for Fluent attributes and lack of compile-time verification of the Fluent files (in case of compile-time embedding) which led me to hard-to-debug runtime bugs where my application just wouldn&#39;t start (since the crate panicked on load). At that point I just decided to give it a go and create <a href="https://github.com/Instant-Reactive-Systems/i18n"><code>i18n</code></a>. This crate features the same core features that <code>fluent-templates</code> has but now with a cleaner codebase, support for compile-time verification during embedding, an option to scan whether each localization file matches every other in terms of the &quot;completeness&quot; (whether every Fluent entry exists in all files), support for Fluent attributes, lazily-localized Fluent attributes, neat macros that make the crate slightly easier to use, and a <code>LocalizedDisplay</code> trait that you can implement for your types to output a <code>i18n::Message</code>. There is also support for loading Fluent definitions from a network resource under the <code>net</code> feature-flag.</p> <p>There is also an accompanying Leptos localization crate <a href="https://github.com/Instant-Reactive-Systems/i18n-leptos"><code>i18n-leptos</code></a> which I created as a replacement for the <a href="https://github.com/Baptistemontan/leptos_i18n"><code>leptos_i18n</code></a> crate which uses <code>fluent_templates</code> and provides a reactive localization if the set language changes.</p> <p>I am posting this here (created my first ever Reddit account even) to share it to anybody who might be looking for something like this, and also to garner some constructive criticism on where you might see an issue or an area of improvement. Looking forward to it!</p> <p>EDIT: Forgot to add a link to the <code>i18n-leptos</code> crate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Prize-Fortune5913"> /u/Prize-Fortune5913 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o50asd/a_fluentbased_highlevel_crate_for_localization/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o50asd/a_fluentbased_highlevel_crate_for_localization/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had the same argument multiple times, and even thought this myself before I tried rust.</p> <p>The argument goes, &#39;why would I write regular business-logic app X in Rust? I don&#39;t think I need the performance or want to worry about memory safety. It sounds like it comes at the cost of usability, since it&#39;s hard to imagine life without a GC.&#39;</p> <p>My own experience started out the same way. I wanted to learn Rust but never found the time. I thought other languages I already knew covered all the use-cases I needed. I would only reach for Rust if I needed something very low-level, which was very unlikely.</p> <p>What changed? I just tried Rust on a whim for some small utilities, and AI tools made it easier to do that. I got the quick satisfaction of writing something against the win32 C API bindings and just seeing it go, even though I had never done that before. It was super fun and motivated me to learn more.</p> <p>Eventually I found a relevant work project, and I have spent 6 months since then doing most of the rust work on a clojure team (we have ~7k lines of Rust on top of AWS Cedar, a web server, and our own JVM FFI with UniFFI). I think my original reasoning to pigeonhole Rust into a systems use-case and avoid it was wrong. It&#39;s quite usable, and I&#39;m very productive in it for non-low-level work. It&#39;s more expressive than the static languages I know, and safer than the dynamic languages I know. The safety translates into fewer bugs, which feels more productive as time goes on, and it comes from pattern-matching/ADTs in addition to the borrow checker. I had spent some years working in OCaml, and Rust felt pretty similar in a good way. I see success stories where other people say the same things, eg aurora DSQL: <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html">https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html</a></p> <blockquote> <p>the couple of weeks spent learning Rust no longer looked like a big deal, when compared with how long it‚Äôd have taken us to get the same results on the JVM. We stopped asking, ‚ÄúShould we be using Rust?‚Äù and started asking ‚ÄúWhere else could Rust help us solve our problems?‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>But, the language brands itself as a systems language.</p> <p>The next time someone makes this argument, what&#39;s the quickest way to break through and talk about what makes rust not only unique for that specific systems use-case but generally good for &#39;normal&#39; (eg, web programming, data-processing) code?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gtrak"> /u/gtrak </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o4fmlg/rust_is_a_lowlevel_systems_language_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o4fmlg/rust_is_a_lowlevel_systems_language_not/">[comments]</a></span></div>
