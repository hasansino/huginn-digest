I would split upload to four func, let say <code>uploadFiles()</code> running 4 times. Using sync.WaitGroup I can secure that all files will be uploaded. But how make progress how many files are to upload to avoid race condition? I want show something like:</p> <p><code>Uploading file 12/134...</code></p> <p>So I have to declare variable <code>progress</code> int32, create pointer like <code>ptrProgress</code> to it and using <code>atomic.AddInt32</code> to update it by command inside <code>uploadFiles()</code> like that:</p> <p><code>atomic.AddInt32(&amp;ptrProgress, ptrProgress++)</code></p> <p>Is it correct approach? To show progress I have to create other function like <code>showProgress</code> and add it as goroutine? So it should be something like that:</p> <p><code>func main() {</code></p> <p><code>var wg sync.WaitGroup</code></p> <p><code>for i := 1; i &lt;= 4; i++ {</code></p> <p><code>wg.Go(func() {</code></p> <p><code>uploadFiles(filesData[i))</code></p> <p><code>})</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p><code>wg.Go(showProgress())</code></p> <p><code>wg.Wait()</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p>Is it correct approach to this problem or I miss something?

This system behaves like a device with millions of cores that can handle massively parallel execution, but each core charges money in a native cryptocurrency called <strong>goldcoin</strong> to execute computational work. Also there is no barrier to node participation.</p> <p>For more information, check the Whitepaper: <a href="https://github.com/bajoescience/Marketplace/blob/master/Whitepaper.pdf">Marketplace-Whitepaper (PDF)</a></p> <p>So there are two assets in this project, goldcoin (GDC) &quot;the native currency&quot;, and <strong>Gold Trust Token (GTT)</strong> &quot;the native token&quot;. The GTT represents the shares of all market fees collected on all jobs (computational work) across the network. There is a private company that distributes the GTT according to a schedule as described by the whitepaper.</p> <p>Due to how mission critical the software is, and how efficient the implementation has to be (Think kernel context switch), I&#39;m writing the project in rust. But the problem is that although I have over 3 years of experience in Javascript web development, and some experience in C. I just started to learn rust, and I&#39;m not going to be good enough to code this anytime soon.</p> <p>So I would like an experienced Rust-developer co-founder, that can build the foundation, with me being a fringe tech contributor for now (I&#39;ll handle all stages of development). I want to at least build a small prototype(MVP) that can be tested with a strong open-source structure to allow for ease of contribution.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been tinkering with Rust now for a year, mostly for fun in the evenings. </p> <p>So far I&#39;ve (attempted to) build a magical question answering machine (cli based completions endpoint), a IDE for legal documents (I got bored, when I realised how much regexing I have to do), a mobile chess like tactics game, a finance app, I tried some real-time video analysis and all sorts of little things. I&#39;m amazed by Rust (and Egui).</p> <p>This story is how I decided to build one service in Rust during business hours.</p> <p>Mainly I do JavaScript at work and now looking at it - it&#39;s just beating out production software in hyper speed. If the task is known, then writing the code to it is straightforward. The abstraction level is so high, that there isn&#39;t even much to do.</p> <p>Well Rust has pushed me to another path - in the evenings I take an immense amount of time and just do it very slowly. It cannot really be hurried for me at least if I want to learn and understand.</p> <p>After a year and 7 projects I&#39;ve sort of developed a way on how to do things and now I started to wonder, if this is actually readable to other people. </p> <p>So I&#39;d totally appreciate some feedback on weather people consider stuff like this maintainable and what else I should look out for:<br/> <a href="https://github.com/outvoicer/kyb">https://github.com/outvoicer/kyb</a><br/> <strong># About the process</strong>. </p> <p>The service provides a name based search to Latvian Business Registry and validates members of board. </p> <p>I chose this piece of software for showcase, as business registry server often qualifies as a minimum useful software. Sort of the first meaningful piece of software you can write, that is actually useful. I knew from before that everything in Rust takes... longer then in other places.</p> <p>And I guess the &quot;meaningful software&quot; part is relevant, as it&#39;s easy to build a beautiful &quot;Hello world&quot; server, the complexities are coming later, when the new scope is suddenly revealed.</p> <p>In this process I first needed the Member of Board validation and when I had that already, then I realised I&#39;d always dreamed of a websocket based search for Latvian organisations by name, including governmental institutions and also VAT numbers. Because in mobile the company search over REST tends to suck in the beginning, when searching for &quot;SIA A&quot; and this tends to cascade into other problems. </p> <p>Now looking back I&#39;m not super happy, how I solved the VAT part - this needs fixing soon. What can I say, apparently I was very excited to use hashset. </p> <p><strong># Time</strong></p> <p>So this was my first time to do Rust at work. At work there&#39;s much less time for things than in the evenings. </p> <p>So the timepressure while doing Rust was a new experience. Funnily enough - I started this as a wibe-coding exercise. I started with the assumption, that AI could write the whole thing. </p> <p>I let gpt-4o write the first code for the server and for routing. It also made the choice to use Actix. After that already manual intervention seamed to be necessary so 1 week is all it took to finish the member of board part. </p> <p>(I also know, that this is not how you wibe-code. I&#39;ve talked with Lovable, I talked with it a whole 30 minutes, I could not get it to deploy a /apple-site-associations file. So there&#39;s that.)</p> <p>GPT also wrote the initial structs decoding the CSV. And yeah, generally I don&#39;t think I could be a Rust developer without the use of AI. Or maybe I could, but my timeline would be more like NASA ones - years, not weeks.</p> <p><strong># Deployment</strong> </p> <p>That&#39;s my first rust deployment, I tried to document this as well. </p> <p>First I kept the service in the same Ubuntu with one other service. That did not end well for the other service. </p> <p>I have not had time to figure out, what caused it - the rust binary seams to use little processor and little RAM. If I&#39;d have to guestimate I&#39;d say that Rust programs often have bigger hard drive footprint then one would guess. </p> <p>Also I want to tell my favourite Rust joke - it&#39;s about memory safety. Yes, the language is memory safe. And it&#39;s also so effective, that bad code can drain all memory immediately. Kinda I was hoping in the beginning, that also my code would be memory safe, as Rust is, but yeah, there goes that.</p> <p>After this the service got it&#39;s own server. The Digital Ocean 4 EUR one was a bit too little to finish the &quot;cargo build&quot; for Linux so I opted to the 6 EUR tier.</p> <p><strong># Licencing</strong></p> <p>So I&#39;ve been fascinated about the Rust dual-licencing model.</p> <p>So I figured I&#39;m going to put that to work. Its open source, but if someone want&#39;s to use it commercially and actually has a compliance department then the possibility exists. </p> <p>Well I&#39;ve learned this is not how dual licensing works. This is also not how open source works. </p> <p>So I&#39;ve always been a MIT open-source guy and in this experiment I&#39;ve found that now I&#39;m a &quot;source available&quot; guy.</p> <p>I also may have taken legal advice from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/r27asw/comment/hm3cm4d/">this fellow redditor</a>.</p> <p>Mainly I look at the licensing part as an experiment - whether anyone ever contacts me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extension_Card_6830"> /u/Extension_Card_6830 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nb3534/first_project_in_production_after_a_one_year/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nb3534/first_project_in_production_after_a_one_year/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted SwiftUI&#39;s declarative style and type safety, but for all platforms. So I built WaterUI - a Rust UI framework that gives you the best of both worlds.</p> <h1>Why another UI framework?</h1> <p>I love SwiftUI&#39;s approach - declarative, type-safe, with a modern API. But existing cross-platform solutions all have trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>SwiftUI</strong>: Apple-only</li> <li><strong>Flutter</strong>: Ignores native look-and-feel</li> <li><strong>React Native</strong>: JS runtime, not fully type-safe</li> <li><strong>Existing Rust frameworks</strong>: Either immediate mode (egui) or missing the reactive programming model I wanted</li> </ul> <h1>What makes WaterUI different?</h1> <p>‚ú® <strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>True native rendering</strong> - Uses SwiftUI on Apple platforms (yes, even visionOS/watchOS/widgets!)</li> <li><strong>Vue-like fine-grained reactivity</strong> - Allows efficient updates without virtual DOM</li> <li><strong>Type-safe from top to bottom</strong> - Leverage Rust&#39;s type system fully</li> <li><strong>Declarative &amp; reactive</strong> - Familiar to SwiftUI/React developers</li> <li><strong>Cross-platform</strong> - Supports multiple backends (gtk4 backend and swiftui backend are ready now)</li> </ul> <h1>Code Example</h1> <pre><code>use waterui::prelude::*; pub fn counter() -&gt; impl View { let count = Binding::int(0); let doubled = count.map(|n| n * 2); vstack(( text!(&quot;Count: {count}&quot;), text!(&quot;Doubled: {doubled}&quot;) .font_size(20) .foreground_color(Color::gray()), hstack(( button(&quot;Increment&quot;) .action_with(&amp;count,|count| count.increment(1)), button(&quot;Reset&quot;) .action_with(&amp;count,|count| count.set(0)) .foreground_color(Color::red()), )) .spacing(10), )) .padding(20) .spacing(15) } </code></pre> <h1>Current Status</h1> <p>The framework is in <strong>alpha</strong> but actively developed.

To clarify: I actually prepared a <a href="https://github.com/water-rs/waterui/tree/main/backends/gtk4">GTK4 backend</a> as well, mainly to validate that the architecture can work across different platforms.</p> <p>That said, the project is still at a very early stage, and the API will likely go through many breaking changes. Since I‚Äôve been heavily inspired by SwiftUI ‚Äî to the point that my planned layout system is fully aligned with it ‚Äî most of my effort has gone into the SwiftUI backend for now.</p> <p>Before finalizing the API design, I don‚Äôt want to spread my effort across too many backends. At this stage, it‚Äôs enough to prove the architecture is feasible, rather than maintain feature parity everywhere.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/4w3revp4hrnf1.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9fe626b56db14255c7f1eb56ce6fd59a87d587">https://preview.redd.it/4w3revp4hrnf1.png?width=1824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9fe626b56db14255c7f1eb56ce6fd59a87d587</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/real-lexo"> /u/real-lexo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nauo67/waterui_a_swiftuiinspired_crossplatform_ui/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nauo67/waterui_a_swiftuiinspired_crossplatform_ui/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last month I landed a job as a Rust developer, so I wanted to share my experience in hope someone would find it helpful.</p> <h1>Background</h1> <p>I am a SW engineer with ~10 years of experience. For the last 4 years I worked for a Web3 startup as a Rust developer. As most of Web3 startups do, this one had to suddenly abrupt its existence thus leaving me in a quite a precarious state when I had to find a new workplace to provide for my little hoard.</p> <p>Even after working for Web3 I am not sold on the fundamental idea of such projects, so I was focusing on finding a job in some different industry, even though I considered opportunities from Web3 for the sake of not starving.</p> <p>In the location I live there are almost no SW companies, especially not ones that use Rust, and I cannot relocate at this point of my life, so I was specifically looking for a remote position. But since my time-zone is UTC+9, it made this search much more difficult.</p> <h1>Ideas and implementation</h1> <p>So my strategy for landing a job was:</p> <ol> <li>To send as many resumes to relevant job postings as I could.</li> <li>Start sending pool requests to some open source projects backed by big tech to get noticed.</li> <li>I also have somewhat popular open source <a href="https://github.com/Maximkaaa/galileo">https://github.com/Maximkaaa/galileo</a>, so I thought I can try to leverage it by posting to related communities.</li> </ol> <p>To implement p.1 I started daily search through LinkedIn, rustjobs sites, indeed, who is hiring thread here and everywhere I could find. Over the course of a month I sent probably 20-30 resumes to position that caught my eye.</p> <p>For p.2 I did some work for uutils project, but I wouldn&#39;t call my contribution by any means impressive or impactful.</p> <p>Fr p.3, well, I posted to geo channel on discord.</p> <h1>Results</h1> <p>Most of the resumes I sent through LinkedIn or other aggregators were either ignored or resulted in a standard rejection letter. I got invited for an interview with 2 Web3 companies, and for both of them the other party didn&#39;t show up for the interview ( ::what?:: ). I would say that from all the aggregators <a href="/r/rust/">r/rust/</a> who is hiring was the most impactful. Out of ~4 CVs that I sent, I had 1 interview with another Web3 company that I failed miserably because it was at 3am my time and I could hardly think, and another interview with a real product company, that went extremely well and almost ended up with hiring, but failed competition in the end probably because of my timezone.</p> <p>P.2 didn&#39;t result in anything, but that was as expected.</p> <p>P.3 was interesting, as it was met with full silence for 4 weeks, and then suddenly I was invited to join a very interesting project, but I already agreed to another offer at this point, so I had to refuse.</p> <p>In the end what brought me my new position at NXLog were not my efforts, but a reference by one of my former colleagues. I guy who I worked with introduced my to HR of that company who they had contact with, and after 3 round of interviews I got a job. The funny thing is that I believe I sent CV to that company before through LinkedIn, and it was ignored like in all the other companies.</p> <p>So my advice to people looking for job: focus on networking. Finding a position without someone saying that they know you and know what you can do is quite hard even when you have a lot of relevant experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DoItYourselfMate"> /u/DoItYourselfMate </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1naq46z/me_experience_finding_a_job_as_rust_developer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1naq46z/me_experience_finding_a_job_as_rust_developer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It uses the actual real-world equations and scientific constants to compute path of rays (basically raytracing) around a massive blackhole. I used MacroQuad, Glam and Rayon to create this project. It was really super easy to deploy to web by compiling it to WebAssembly.</p> <p>Currently this is just a 2D Simulation but I&#39;d also recreate in 3d in a future project.</p> <p>You can also run this on your browser <a href="https://dr0pdev.github.io/gargantua/">here</a>.</p> <p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/dr0pdev/gargantua">github repo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Echo705"> /u/Accomplished_Echo705 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/v5pgn98kipnf1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1naobf4/media_i_created_a_blackhole_simulation_in/">[comments]</a></span></div>
