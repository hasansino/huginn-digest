Doesn&#39;t really matter all that much but it&#39;s just a small detail that I thought I might add. Is this some type of camera rail?

I would love to know the best way to get started, what resources we should look into, and if there are any subreddits that are good to ask questions on and peruse info. Or if there are any discord servers that he could join to help his dreams come true via advice or people with skills that he could learn from.

I learn best when i have a problem to solve so I decided to tackle a problem I have with git clients. I usually get pretty confused regarding the topology of the commit graph without visual tools like git graph, sourcetree and gitkraken. However they dont allow you to go far into the history due to the nature of the git graph. And they load it lazily which is always annoying to me. So i did my best to fix this. Its not super duper optimised right now, but even now im able to preload the emacs repo (200000 commits) in a few seconds and have random access to any commit, together with the graph rendering.</p> <p>There are few optimizations i have in mind to make it twice as fast at least (i think) and have a much lesser memory footprint. I have gone through a few iterations of development, but for now im satisfied.</p> <p>Im mostly working on the features i personally need in my day to day work, so its not production ready of course.</p> <p>Im also not the best rust dev, and im lazy as well, so i do lots of unwraps and rely on happy paths a lot.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a> and happy new year! I&#39;d like to share a project I&#39;ve been working on. I&#39;m a scientist/software developer at the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I joined my group right before the COVID pandemic and I&#39;m now a member of the ImageJ/Fiji development team (a Java-based open source scientific image processing platform). Since then I&#39;ve really enjoyed programming, image processing algorithms and open source software. For the last year or two, a few of my friends have pushed me to get into Rust and well...they were right. I love it. It&#39;s my preferred language to develop in now. To further grow my Rust skills (and learn more about image processing) I started the <code>imgal</code> project, a scientific n-dimensional image processing library with Python, C and Java bindings.</p> <h1>What is imgal?</h1> <p>Imgal (IMaGe Algorithm Library) is a scientific image processing and algorithm library inspired by the ImageJ/Fiji/SciJava ecosystem. Imgal is written in a functional programming style, so I try my best to pay attention to side effects, state and pure functions. I’m sure if you look there are places where that is not true in imgal. (I love feedback so please educate me if you see something). If you use scikit-image in Python land then you essentially know what this project is. If not, the idea is its a FP image processing library that aims to bring fast, well-documented scientific image processing. Imgal also aims to meet the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data">FAIR</a> principles. </p> <h1>Why did I start imgal?</h1> <p>Imgal is a <em>selfish</em> project. It&#39;s a place for me to learn how to be a better Rust developer (I&#39;m an &quot;it&#39;s about the journey&quot; kind of fellow) and also expand my skills as an imaging scientist. Imgal originally started out as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor_approach_to_fluorescence_lifetime_and_spectral_imaging">Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) phasor analysis</a> library as more of an experiment in Rust and also to understand the math in Phasor analysis. Obviously the experiment was successful! I have a strong understanding of the phasor math (I wrote the implementation myself) and my experience made me realize that I could do more…and here we are.</p> <h1>How is imgal organized?</h1> <p>Imgal is organized as a monorepo with imgal as the core library and <code>imgal_c</code>, <code>imgal_java</code> and <code>imgal_python</code> as the respective language bindings. I chose this layout because I wanted to prevent adding more dependencies to the core library. As a developer I have a <strong>strong</strong> allergic reaction to adding dependencies to a project, and wherever possible I will try to roll my own implementations.</p> <h1>Is imgal complete?</h1> <p>No. Like I said, I&#39;m trying to learn here. I know I can ask an LLM to en masse convert existing frameworks (i.e. imagej-ops, scijava-ops, etc...) into Rust but I <strong>hate</strong> that. This means that some namespaces are mostly complete (see the “phasor” namespace) but most are not as it takes me time to understand the algorithm and design the implementation. What guides my attention are the needs of my science. For example you’ll notice the threshold namespace only has Nobuyuki’s Otsu method. This is because I needed that threshold method for my work and I haven’t had the free/fun time to jump into the other threshold algorithms.</p> <h1>How can I use imgal?</h1> <p>Right now there are 4 ways to use the library:</p> <ol> <li>Rust: Use the <code>imgal</code> core library in your own project.</li> <li>Python: You can install the Python bindings to the library from PyPI by pip installing the <code>pyimgal</code> package or building the <code>imgal_python</code> crate from source.</li> <li>Java (prototype): I’m still deciding how to do this, but right now I have a prototype of this using Java 22+ and the FFM API. One of my friends suggested I use Kotlin native, but I’m not a big Kotlin guy so that requires some research. Any suggestions?</li> <li>C (prototype): The Java bindings consume CABI so the C bindings are also in an embryonic state. I’m still thinking about how to do this given that imgal uses generic types. Any suggestions? </li> </ol> <h1>AI/LLM stance</h1> <p>I’ve been lurking in the Rust subreddit for a while and I have come to feel that I should be explicit about LLM use with regards to imgal. Like I said before I <strong>do not</strong> enjoy LLMs writing my code. I have an internal desire to understand every line (crazy I know). However I do use LLMs as a consultant. For example I’ve come to favor using iterators over for loops (this makes parallelizing functions with rayon an absolute dream) and the LLMs have been great for teaching me the iterator way.</p> <p>If you’re curious/interested you can check out imgal here!</p> <p>Repo: GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/imgal-sc/imgal/">https://github.com/imgal-sc/imgal/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/image_ed"> /u/image_ed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q1dlso/imgal_an_opensource_scientific_image/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q1dlso/imgal_an_opensource_scientific_image/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is a fork of the mini-moka lib: <a href="https://github.com/moka-rs/mini-moka">https://github.com/moka-rs/mini-moka</a>, stripped down to the bare essentials. It provides a non-thread-safe (unsync) cache that uses the W-TinyLFU eviction policy, ideally maintaining a near-optimal hit ratio while having the tiniest possible footprint.</p> <p>Reasoning behind building this at all was because I needed the smart eviction of Moka/Caffeine but wanted to reduce the compile-time overhead of the full feature set (async, concurrency, etc.) for some WASM stuff I&#39;m working on. It&#39;s basically an even more lightweight mini-moka, but retaining the important bits (the W-TinyLFU (LFU admission + LRU eviction) implementation) and stripping away some of the stuff that I didn&#39;t need.</p> <p>Anyway, lemme know what you think :) It&#39;s my first rust project :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gcvvvvvv"> /u/gcvvvvvv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q1clkv/micro_moka_a_hyperlightweight_singlethreaded/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q1clkv/micro_moka_a_hyperlightweight_singlethreaded/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last year I&#39;ve started reading The Rust Programming Language on my Kindle in my spare time (like when going to the gym, waiting for the bus to go to college, etc.) and even though I haven&#39;t finish it yet (I&#39;m about ~53%), I wanted to start practicing.</p> <p>I&#39;m not gonna lie, I was tempted to build this using something like Tauri, since I&#39;m a web developer, but then there wouldn&#39;t be any challenge at all, so I decided to go all in.</p> <p>And man, Rust is SO COOL. I don&#39;t even have words to describe how good it feels to write Rust code after programming with Java and TypeScript all my life. Also, I love how welcoming this community is!</p> <p>For this <code>multiseat-rs</code> project, I&#39;m using relm4, and it works with udev and logind to provide its functionalities. The goal is to make multiseat setups easier. In case you’re not familiar with multiseat, it allows multiple users to use the same machine at the same time, each with their own screen, keyboard, and mouse.</p> <p>If you want to check it out, here&#39;s the link of the repo: <a href="https://github.com/willybarret/multiseat-rs.git">https://github.com/willybarret/multiseat-rs.git</a></p> <p>Sorry if my English isn&#39;t great, I&#39;m not a native speaker.</p> <p>Happy New Year everyone!

What I am struggling with, is the fact that I do not understand clearly how all of this would be used to actually make an application.</p> <p>I realize that in the years I have been using Claude Code, it caused me to he in this problem. Understanding concepts, but not how to use them.</p> <p>What is the best I could do in this scenario? Just keep going with the Rust book even though I do not understand how to practically use the concepts that are being taught?</p> <p>Like, I tried to make a calculator in the terminal, and I was just fully struggling with making it.
