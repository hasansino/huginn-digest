            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Currently working on a microservice which essentially automates certain workflows. Each workflow status needs to be saved and that workflow contains let&#39;s say a parent status which also contains multiple sub-workflows that also contains each of their status. I initially plan to just create a middleware for saving status changes in the struct that is being modified.</p> <p>So for middleware plan I struct will be saved initially so for loop the entire struct save the initial status of each then do that as well after processing of the business logic. It should supposedly work but I also checked out the observer pattern. Is that something that could apply fairly well in this specially for database saves? To add further context I am simply saving the workflow status and sub-workflow status just for debugging purposes and also possibly record tracking in the future.</p> <p>PS: I am very noob, I may be overengineering this or trying a bit too hard when the simple solution should work fine, but still trying to pick from the brains of those more experienced.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ShookethThySpear"> /u/ShookethThySpear </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mri75k/using_observer_pattern_to_save_status_in_database/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mri75k/using_observer_pattern_to_save_status_in_database/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mr5uwv/gluau_go_bindings_for_the_luau_programming/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Gluau is a library that uses CGo (and a rust proxy layer) to provide safe Go bindings for Luau. It&#39;s been a hobby project of mine and it&#39;s finally at a state where it&#39;s usable for simple tasks (though it is still a heavy WIP and I do need a bit of help in packaging it).</p> <h2>Implemented APIs so far</h2> <ul> <li>VM initialization and shutdown</li> <li>Basic Lua value API to abstract over Lua values via Go interfaces</li> <li>Lua Strings (along with API&#39;s)</li> <li>Lua Tables (along with API&#39;s)</li> <li>Lua Functions (API&#39;s are WIP, but basic creating from both Luau and Go and calling functions is implemented)</li> </ul> <h2>Roadmap</h2> <ul> <li>Support for sandboxing and interrupts (these two are pretty easy to add)</li> <li>More function-related API&#39;s</li> <li>Support for buffer types etc.</li> <li>Support for userdata</li> </ul> <h2>Benefits over other libraries</h2> <h3>Exception Handling Support</h3> <p>Unlike prior attempts at this such as <a href="https://github.com/aarzilli/golua">golua</a>, gluau has full support for Luau exception handling. This means that you can use Luau&#39;s <code>pcall</code> and <code>xpcall</code> functions to handle errors in your Lua code, and they will work seamlessly even with Go&#39;s (different) error handling. Panic&#39;s inside of Go callbacks are also recovered and returned as error strings to Luau code as well.</p> <p>gluau achieves this feat (that is normally pretty hard due to the incompatible exception handling between Lua/Luau and Go) by using a Rust proxy layer to actually manage the Lua VM. In short, the Rust side provides handles to Lua objects and its own C API to manipulate those. When Luau errors, Rust can correctly catch these errors and convert them to a Result struct for Go.</p> <h3>Automatic Stack Management</h3> <p>gluau&#39;s Rust proxy layer uses <code>mluau</code> (a fork of mlua that I made to address some issues I had with mlua) internally (and exposes a nice API based on it to Go). This means that you shouldn&#39;t be able to cause a segfault by just using the gluau API normally (if you do, then thats a bug). That being said, a lot of gluau&#39;s ergonomics (such as the Value type stuff, type conversions etc.) do use a ton of <code>unsafe</code> so there&#39;ll probably be some dragons during the early stages.</p> <h2>Drawbacks</h2> <p>gluau is not very well tested (yet!) and also makes heavy use of CGo for obvious reasons. If you want a pure Go Lua interpreter, then Shopify&#39;s go-lua (lua 5.2 in pure go) might be more your style (although it doesn&#39;t support sandboxing as well as Luau does)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lower_Calligrapher_6"> /u/Lower_Calligrapher_6 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/gluau/gluau">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mr5uwv/gluau_go_bindings_for_the_luau_programming/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p> Like many of you who manage a media library, I often run into video files with embedded image-based subtitles (like PGS for Blu-rays or VobSub for DVDs). Getting those</p> <p> into the universally compatible .srt format was always a hassle, requiring multiple tools and steps.</p> <p> To solve this for myself, I created <strong>Subtitle Forge</strong>, a desktop application for macOS, and Linux that makes the process much simpler.</p> <p> It&#39;s a tool with both a GUI and a CLI, but the main features of the GUI version are:</p> <p> * <strong>Extract &amp; Convert:</strong> Pulls subtitles directly from MKV files.</p> <p> * <strong>OCR for Image Subtitles:</strong> Converts PGS (SUP) and VobSub (SUB/IDX) subtitles into text-based SRT files using OCR. It also handles ASS/SSA to SRT conversion.</p> <p> * <strong>Batch Processing:</strong> You can load a video file and process multiple subtitle tracks at once.</p> <p> * <strong>Insert Subtitles:</strong> You can also use it to add an external SRT file back into an MKV.</p> <p> * <strong>Modern GUI:</strong> It has a clean, simple drag-and-drop interface, progress bars with time estimates, and dark theme support.</p> <p> The app is built with Go and the Fyne (<a href="https://fyne.io/">https://fyne.io/</a>) toolkit for the cross-platform GUI. It&#39;s open-source, and I&#39;m hoping to get some feedback from the community to</p> <p> make it even better.</p> <p> You can check it out, see screenshots, and find the installation instructions over on GitHub:</p> <p> <a href="https://github.com/VenimK/Subtitle-Forge"><strong>https://github.com/VenimK/Subtitle-Forge</strong></a></p> <p> I&#39;d love to hear what you think!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m a protocol designer in the early stages of architecting a new decentralized system. A core component of this system requires executing arbitrary, untrusted code submitted by users in a secure, sandboxed environment. After a lot of research, I&#39;ve decided to use a WASM runtime, and my current plan is to use Wasmtime for its maturity and security focus. My question is for those of you with deep experience in this area. Beyond the basic sandboxing guarantees of WASM, what are the more subtle, &quot;unknown unknown&quot; security concerns I should be designing for? My threat model assumes the untrusted WASM code will be actively malicious and will try to: 1.Escape the sandbox to read the host file system or network. (Wasmtime seems. to have strong defenses here). 2.Perform side-channel attacks (like Spectre/Meltdown) to infer data from other processes on the same machine. 3.Trigger a &quot;denial of service&quot; by consuming excessive resources (a &quot;billion laughs&quot; type of attack). For this, I plan to use Wasmtime&#39;s &quot;fuel&quot; feature to limit execution steps. I&#39;m particularly interested in best practices for configuring the Wasmtime engine and the host environment itself for a truly multi-tenant, high-stakes system where the sandboxed code from one user must have zero ability to affect or even detect the presence of code from another user running on the same hardware. Are there specific compiler flags, linker settings, or Wasmtime engine configurations that are considered essential for this level of security? Any war stories or references to academic papers on the topic would be hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance for your insights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Radiant-Green9593"> /u/Radiant-Green9593 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mrbq90/best_practices_for_secure_multitenant_wasm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mrbq90/best_practices_for_secure_multitenant_wasm/">[comments]</a></span></div>
