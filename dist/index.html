            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/jonahlund/vy">github</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/vy">crates.io</a></p> <p>About half a year ago, I released <code>vy</code> 0.1 in an attempt to bridge the gap for convenient and simple HTML generation in Rust. I realized that for larger projects, the lack of automatic macro body formatting tends to make HTML sections feel &quot;stale&quot; over time - manually maintaining formatting becomes tedious, often leading to inconsistent line widths and spacing across the codebase.</p> <p>This release features an almost complete redesign of the library, focusing on developer experience and long-term maintainability for large projects.</p> <p>Function components:</p> <p>```rust use vy::prelude::*;</p> <p>pub fn page(content: impl IntoHtml) -&gt; impl IntoHtml { ( DOCTYPE, html!( head!( meta!(charset = &quot;UTF-8&quot;), title!(&quot;My Title&quot;), meta!( name = &quot;viewport&quot;, content = &quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot; ), meta!(name = &quot;description&quot;, content = &quot;&quot;), link!(rel = &quot;icon&quot;, href = &quot;favicon.ico&quot;) ), body!(h1!(&quot;My Heading&quot;), content) ), ) } ```</p> <p>Struct components:</p> <p>```rust use vy::prelude::*;</p> <p>struct Article { title: String, content: String, author: String, }</p> <p>impl IntoHtml for Article { fn into_html(self) -&gt; impl IntoHtml { article!( h1!(self.title), p!(class = &quot;content&quot;, self.content), footer!(&quot;Written by &quot;, self.author) ) } } ```</p> <p>Key improvements for 0.2:</p> <ul> <li><p>**<code>rustfmt</code>-compatible syntax**<br/> The reworked syntax now works well with <code>rustfmt</code>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Zero-wrapper macros</strong><br/> Simply import the prelude and write <code>div!(&quot;..&quot;)</code> or <code>button!(&quot;..&quot;)</code> anywhere. This proves particularly useful for patterns like returning HTML from <code>match</code> arms - just write tags directly without extra boilerplate. An example of this, a snippet of code i wrote for a client: <code>rust const fn as_badge(&amp;self) -&gt; impl IntoHtml + use&lt;&gt; { match self { Self::Draft =&gt; { span!(class = &quot;badge-warning&quot;, &quot;Utkast&quot;) } Self::Created =&gt; { span!(class = &quot;badge-info&quot;, &quot;Skapad&quot;) } Self::Sent =&gt; { span!(class = &quot;badge-info&quot;, &quot;Skickad&quot;) } Self::Confirmed =&gt; { span!(class = &quot;badge-success&quot;, &quot;Bekr√§ftad&quot;) } } } </code></p></li> <li><p><strong>Composable types</strong><br/> All macros return simple <code>IntoHtml</code>-implementing types that can be manually constructed. Need fragments? Use tuples: <code>(div!(&quot;..&quot;), span!(&quot;..&quot;))</code>. Want to unwrap tag contents? Just remove the outer macro: <code>((&quot;..&quot;), span!(&quot;..&quot;))</code>. This dramatically reduces the mental barrier between HTML and Rust code.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Editor support</strong><br/> Standard HTML often require plugins or such for certain code editor features, but since <code>vy</code> 0.2 uses standard Rust macro calls, features like tag jumping and automatic tag completion work out-of-the-box (assuming your editor support these features).</p></li> </ul> <p>Here are some benchmarks for reference:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/jonahlund/rust-html-render-benchmarks">https://github.com/jonahlund/rust-html-render-benchmarks</a></p> <p>```text askama fastest ‚îÇ median<br/> ‚îú‚îÄ big_table 1.107 ms ‚îÇ 1.241 ms<br/> ‚ï∞‚îÄ teams 994.7 ns ‚îÇ 1.017 ¬µs </p> <p>maud fastest ‚îÇ median<br/> ‚îú‚îÄ big_table 333.5 ¬µs ‚îÇ 335.2 ¬µs<br/> ‚ï∞‚îÄ teams 256.7 ns ‚îÇ 262.4 ns </p> <p>vy_0_1 fastest ‚îÇ median<br/> ‚îú‚îÄ big_table 126.4 ¬µs ‚îÇ 127.5 ¬µs<br/> ‚ï∞‚îÄ teams 265.2 ns ‚îÇ 275.8 ns </p> <p>vy_0_2 fastest ‚îÇ median<br/> ‚îú‚îÄ big_table 120 ¬µs ‚îÇ 121.9 ¬µs<br/> ‚ï∞‚îÄ teams 272.7 ns ‚îÇ 327.9 ns<br/> ```</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Organic_Standard2489"> /u/Organic_Standard2489 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8rjn6/vy_020_a_convenient_and_typesafe_html_templating/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8rjn6/vy_020_a_convenient_and_typesafe_html_templating/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;ve been working on this crate for a few weeks now and got to a point where I think it&#39;s interesting enough to share. It&#39;s still very unstable/WIP but it&#39;s a little bit beyond just the proof-of-concept stage now.</p> <p>This is a hobby project of mine that spawned as a tangent from another hobby project inspired by messing with <a href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI">ComfyUI</a>. It just seemed like a very bespoke implementation of something that could be more powerful if done in a general way, in a language with a stronger type-system like Rust. After doing some promising prototypes I decided to go ahead and start making this.</p> <p>Check out the README to see what it is, I&#39;m just making this post because I think it&#39;s interesting enough to share and would love to hear thoughts about it. Here are a few notes from the process of getting to this point:</p> <ul> <li>I went with type-erasure because it would&#39;ve been a very difficult problem to express without it. The proc macro turned out to be incredibly helpful here as I generate code that wraps what happens both before and after type-erasure - so all `dyn Any` things can be checked with as much accuracy as possible, with compile-time or runtime errors, without ever exposing any of the type-erasure to the API that a user has to interact with.</li> <li>Async, concurrent evaluation is the obvious missing link right now. That&#39;s the next thing I&#39;m going to work on. I think it will fit naturally into what&#39;s already here but as I haven&#39;t even gone down that road I don&#39;t know what I might run into. Will I have to stick to a particular runtime like `tokio`? Or can I write it generally enough that other async runtimes could be substituted in?</li> <li>The error system is currently not great. I&#39;m hoping I can make use of spans to make the error messages actually reach the proper areas of code. Right now too much information about where the error occurred is discarded. The graph tracing is cool but currently primitive.</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m not sure if I totally successfully conveyed what this is, but if not I&#39;d be happy to answer questions/update my docs.</p> <p>I have a couple ideas for projects I&#39;d like to make with this, so I&#39;m keeping those use-cases in mind. But generally just wanted to share with the community and hear what thoughts other people have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Eolu"> /u/Eolu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/directed">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8qqsc/directed_an_directedacrylicgraphbased_evaluation/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I am a university student currently compiling a list of Rust crates with clever memory layout tricks for a study/report I am working on. To give an example of what I am alluding to, consider the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/smallbitvec">smallbitvec</a> crate&#39;s <code>SmallBitVec</code>struct. It is defined as follows:</p> <pre><code>pub struct SmallBitVec { data: usize, } </code></pre> <p>The <code>data</code> field either stores the bits of the bitvec directly if they fit within the size of <code>usize</code><sup>1</sup> and if not, <code>data</code> becomes a pointer to a <code>Header</code> struct that looks as follows<sup>2</sup>:</p> <pre><code>struct Header { /// The number of bits in this bit vector. len: Storage, /// The number of elements in the [usize] buffer that follows this header. buffer_len: Storage, } </code></pre> <p>While some may not consider this particularly clever, it is neither particularly straightforward, and any crate that has any structs that employ either this very trick or anything similar would be exactly what I am looking for. This is where I ask for the community&#39;s help. Given that there are close to 180,000 structs indexed on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>, it would be akin to searching for a needle in a haystack if I had to go through all of them individually. Even going through just the most popular structs that are similar to smallbitvec has not yielded me any more examples. Instead, if any of you have come across similar occurrences during your work with Rust, I would be grateful to know the name of the crate and the structure within it that has something like the example above. Although I only need around 5 to 10 examples for my study/report, I welcome as many examples as possible.</p> <p><sup>1</sup> - Technically, it is the size of <code>usize</code> - 2 since 2 bits are used for keeping state<br/> <sup>2</sup> - Well, the pointer is actually one 1 byte ahead of the actual address of the <code>Header</code> struct since the least significant bit is used to tell if the data field is storing bits or is a pointer to the <code>Header</code> struct.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stewie_doin_your_mom"> /u/stewie_doin_your_mom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8mahh/rust_crates_that_use_clever_memory_layout_tricks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8mahh/rust_crates_that_use_clever_memory_layout_tricks/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I&#39;ve just started learning Rust and I&#39;ve noticed some behavior that&#39;s inconsistent for me. I don&#39;t know the exact term for this, so I couldn&#39;t even search for it. Sorry if this is a repeat question.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the example code:</p> <pre><code>struct Foo { name: String } impl Foo { fn bar(&amp;self) { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, self.name); } } fn baz(r: &amp;String) { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, r); } let foo: Foo = Foo { name: &quot;some_string&quot;.to_string() }; let foo_ref: &amp;Foo = &amp;foo; // (1) YES foo.bar(); // (2) NO baz(foo_ref.name); // (3) NO let name = foo_ref.name; println!(&quot;{}&quot;, name); // (4) YES println!(&quot;{}&quot;, foo_ref.name); // (5) YES if &quot;hello&quot;.to_string() &lt; foo_ref.name { println!(&quot;x&quot;) } else { println!(&quot;y&quot;) } </code></pre> <p>I&#39;ve added numbers to each line to indicate whether compilation passes (Y) or not (N).</p> <p>First off, #1 seems to implicitly convert Foo into &amp;Foo, and that&#39;s cool since Rust supports it.</p> <p>But #2 throws a compilation error, saying &quot;expected `&amp;String`, but found `String`&quot;. So even though `foo_ref` is `&amp;Foo` and `baz` needs `&amp;String` as its parameter, Rust is like &quot;Hey, foo_ref.name is giving you the `String` value, not `&amp;String`, which extracts the `String` from foo. So you can&#39;t use it,&quot; and I kinda have to accept that, even if it feels a bit off.</p> <p>#3 has the same issue as #2, because the `name`&#39;s type should be determined before I use it on `println` macro.</p> <p>However, in #4, when I directly use foo_ref.name, it doesn&#39;t complain at all, almost like I passed `&amp;String`. I thought maybe it&#39;s thanks to a macro, not native support, so I can&#39;t help but accept it again.</p> <p>Finally, #5 really threw me off. Even without a macro or the &amp; operator, Rust handles it like a reference and doesn&#39;t complain.</p> <p>Even though I don&#39;t understand the exact mechanism of Rust, I made a hypothesis : &quot;This is caused by the difference between &#39;expression&#39; and &#39;assignment&#39;. So, the #4 and #5 was allowed, because the `foo_ref.name` is not &#39;assigned&#39; to any variable, so they can be treated as `String`(not `&amp;String`), but I can&#39;t ensure it.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m just relying on my IDE&#39;s advice without really understanding, and it&#39;s stressing me out. Could someone explain what I&#39;m missing? Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adept_Meringue_6072"> /u/Adept_Meringue_6072 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8a9d6/how_to_understand_implicit_reference_conversion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k8a9d6/how_to_understand_implicit_reference_conversion/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be soon releasing a detective game that lets the player ask questions by text input to unlock answers. Some people read this and think this will be like talking to chatgpt but wrapped in a unity frontend, but in fact my game doesn&#39;t have generative AI. All the text you will ever read in the game was typed by me. I made a whole wiki to use as the foundation of the game. When you ask a question you unlock one of the existing responses, nothing is being generated.</p> <p>I suppose I could say &quot;This game doesn&#39;t use generative AI&quot;, and I have done so in the past, but is there a better way maybe? Any thoughts on this will be appreciated!</p> <p>Edit: Thank you for your responses! I have to make one clarification, the problem is NOT with people playing the game, once you play it you get it. The problem is when marketing the game, making posts in social media, sharing my game, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArcaneThoughts"> /u/ArcaneThoughts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8lj7a/how_do_i_make_it_clear_that_my_game_does_not_use/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8lj7a/how_do_i_make_it_clear_that_my_game_does_not_use/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I meet a lot of young people who are dead set on getting into game development, either indie or not, and don‚Äôt realize it doesn‚Äôt HAVE to all happen online.</p> <p>There is a very very good chance you have a local group of game developers around you. Maybe it‚Äôs a whole ass national org or IDGA chapter organizing local events and / or conferences, maybe it‚Äôs just a local university organizing a site for the Global Game Jam once a year, maybe it‚Äôs 6 people meeting in a cafe every month in your town, or maybe you can be the one starting the cafe group, but although this interest may be niche, it‚Äôs not scientific glass blowing, you are probably not the only person in your area doing it.</p> <p>Sorting by geography may sound arbitrary, and limiting, and it is, but it is also an extremely underrated way to build relationships with people who may be struggling with similar problems to yours, who may be uniquely suited to give someone with your background advice on how to get ahead, even if they‚Äôre working on totally different types of games.</p> <p>Also: yes, they are probably just as weirded out about walking into a room of strangers as you are, use that to break the ice.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TomerJ"> /u/TomerJ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8gvw3/psa_you_probably_live_closer_to_other_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8gvw3/psa_you_probably_live_closer_to_other_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We get the question a lot so I just wanted to put in a premiere, brand new high profile example of assets being used correctly, professionally and without any splash back. Just in case someone stumbles over this on Google.</p> <p>Oblivion Remastered has lots of bespoke work, but anyone who&#39;s spent any time with the Quixel (now Fab) library can spot the assets they used very quickly - primarily in nature, trees, plants, the roads and so on.</p> <p>I flag this because it&#39;s a common misconception that using asset packs is an immediate bad call, wherein the reality is always that it&#39;s <em>asset packs</em> <strong><em>used poorly</em></strong> that give them a bad name. </p> <p>While calling the Quixel library merely an Asset Pack is very reductive, it&#39;s the same principal. You can grab all sorts of mismatching assets from Quixel and make an absolute mess. But if you&#39;re sensible, know what you&#39;re doing, spend the time to select assets that are cohesive and work for the theme you&#39;re going for, nobody will care.</p> <p>Now of course Oblivion will be getting some passes because, well, it&#39;s Oblivion. But you bet your ass the general gaming community would be up in arms if they just asset flipped their way through it. As far as I can tell, though, nobody has really noticed.</p> <p>Edit: Y‚Äôall really have it in for Synty. I didn‚Äôt even mention that store. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MooseTetrino"> /u/MooseTetrino </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8aw1q/new_devs_it_is_perfectly_okay_to_use_asset_packs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k8aw1q/new_devs_it_is_perfectly_okay_to_use_asset_packs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see a lot of sentiment in this sub that&#39;s coming out of a completely misleading foundation and I think it&#39;s seriously hurting your chances at succeeding. </p> <p>You all come to this industry starting as gamers, but you don&#39;t use that experience and the PoV. When working on a game, when thinking about a new idea, you completely forget how it is to be a gamer, what&#39;s the experience of looking for new games to play, of finding new stuff randomly when browsing youtube or social media. You forget how it is to browse Steam or the PlayStation Store as a gamer.</p> <p>When coming up with your next game idea, think hard and honestly. Is this something that you&#39;d rest your eyes on while browsing the new releases? Is this something that looks like a 1,000 review game? Is this something that you&#39;d spend your hard-earned money on over any of the other options out there?</p> <p>No one (barring your closest friends and family, or your most dedicated followers if you&#39;re a creator) is gonna buy your game for the effort you&#39;ve put in it, not for the fun you&#39;ve had while working on the project.</p> <p>Seriously, just got to a pub where they have consoles and stuff and show anyone your game (perhaps act if you were a random player that found it if you want pure honesty). Do you think your game deserves to be purchased and played by a freaking million human beings? If it were sitting at a store shelf, would you expect a million people to pick up the copies among all the choice they have? </p> <p>Forget about who you are, what it takes to make it and only focus on the product itself. Does it stand on its own? It has to.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gari692"> /u/gari692 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k88apu/some_of_you_seriously_need_to_get_that_delusion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k88apu/some_of_you_seriously_need_to_get_that_delusion/">[comments]</a></span></div>
