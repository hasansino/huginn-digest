    <h1>Generic interfaces</h1>
      
      <p class="author">
      Axel Wagner<br>
      7 July 2025
      </p>
      
      <p>There is an idea that is not obvious until you hear about it for the first time: as interfaces are types themselves, they too can have type parameters.
This idea proves to be surprisingly powerful when it comes to expressing constraints on generic functions and types.
In this post, we&rsquo;ll demonstrate it, by discussing the use of interfaces with type parameters in a couple of common scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-tree-set">A simple tree set</h2>
<p>As a motivating example, assume we need a generic version of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">binary search tree</a>.
The elements stored in such a tree need to be ordered, so our type parameter needs a constraint that determines the ordering to use.
A simple option is to use the <a href="/pkg/cmp#Ordered">cmp.Ordered</a> constraint, introduced in Go 1.21.
It restricts a type parameter to ordered types (strings and numbers) and allows methods of the type to use the built-in ordering operators.</p>
<pre><code>// The zero value of a Tree is a ready-to-use empty tree.
type Tree[E cmp.Ordered] struct {
    root *node[E]
}

func (t *Tree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(element)
}

type node[E cmp.Ordered] struct {
    value E
    left  *node[E]
    right *node[E]
}

func (n *node[E]) insert(element E) *node[E] {
    if n == nil {
        return &amp;node[E]{value: element}
    }
    switch {
    case element &lt; n.value:
        n.left = n.left.insert(element)
    case element &gt; n.value:
        n.right = n.right.insert(element)
    }
    return n
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/H7-n33X7P2h">playground</a>)</p>
<p>However, this approach has the disadvantage that it only works on basic types for which <code>&lt;</code> is defined;
you cannot insert struct types, like <a href="/pkg/time#Time">time.Time</a>.</p>
<p>We can remedy that by requiring the user to provide a comparison function:</p>
<pre><code>// A FuncTree must be created with NewTreeFunc.
type FuncTree[E any] struct {
    root *funcNode[E]
    cmp  func(E, E) int
}

func NewFuncTree[E any](cmp func(E, E) int) *FuncTree[E] {
    return &amp;FuncTree[E]{cmp: cmp}
}

func (t *FuncTree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(t.cmp, element)
}

type funcNode[E any] struct {
    value E
    left  *funcNode[E]
    right *funcNode[E]
}

func (n *funcNode[E]) insert(cmp func(E, E) int, element E) *funcNode[E] {
    if n == nil {
        return &amp;funcNode[E]{value: element}
    }
    sign := cmp(element, n.value)
    switch {
    case sign &lt; 0:
        n.left = n.left.insert(cmp, element)
    case sign &gt; 0:
        n.right = n.right.insert(cmp, element)
    }
    return n
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/tiEjuxCHtFF">playground</a>)</p>
<p>This works, but it also comes with downsides.
We can no longer use the zero value of our container type, because it needs to have an explicitly initialized comparison function.
And the use of a function field makes it harder for the compiler to inline the comparison calls, which can introduce a significant runtime overhead.</p>
<p>Using a method on the element type can solve these issues, because methods are directly associated with a type.
A method does not have to be explicitly passed and the compiler can see the target of the call and may be able to inline it.
But how can we express the constraint to require that element types provide the necessary method?</p>
<h2 id="using-the-receiver-in-constraints">Using the receiver in constraints</h2>
<p>The first approach we might try is to define a plain old interface with a <code>Compare</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>type Comparer interface {
    Compare(Comparer) int
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, we quickly realize that this does not work well.
To implement this interface, the method&rsquo;s parameter must itself be <code>Comparer</code>.
Not only does that mean that the implementation of this method must type-assert the parameter to its own type, it also requires that every type must explicitly refer to our package with the <code>Comparer</code> type by name (otherwise the method signatures would not be identical).
That is not very orthogonal.</p>
<p>A better approach is to make the <code>Comparer</code> interface itself generic:</p>
<pre><code>type Comparer[T any] interface {
    Compare(T) int
}
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>Comparer</code> now describes a whole family of interfaces, one for each type that <code>Comparer</code> may be instantiated with.
A type that implements <code>Comparer[T]</code> declares &ldquo;I can compare myself to a <code>T</code>&rdquo;.
For instance, <code>time.Time</code> naturally implements <code>Comparer[time.Time]</code> because <a href="/pkg/time#Time.Compare">it has a matching <code>Compare</code> method</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Implements Comparer[Time]
func (t Time) Compare(u Time) int
</code></pre>
<p>This is better, but not enough.
What we really want is a constraint that says that a type parameter can be compared to <em>itself</em>: we want the constraint to be self-referential.
The subtle insight is that the self-referential aspect does not have to be part of the interface definition itself; specifically, the constraint for <code>T</code> in the <code>Comparer</code> type is just <code>any</code>.
Instead, it is a consequence of how we use <code>Comparer</code> as a constraint for the type parameter of <code>MethodTree</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// The zero value of a MethodTree is a ready-to-use empty tree.
type MethodTree[E Comparer[E]] struct {
    root *methodNode[E]
}

func (t *MethodTree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(element)
}

type methodNode[E Comparer[E]] struct {
    value E
    left  *methodNode[E]
    right *methodNode[E]
}

func (n *methodNode[E]) insert(element E) *methodNode[E] {
    if n == nil {
        return &amp;methodNode[E]{value: element}
    }
    sign := element.Compare(n.value)
    switch {
    case sign &lt; 0:
        n.left = n.left.insert(element)
    case sign &gt; 0:
        n.right = n.right.insert(element)
    }
    return n
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/LuhzYej_2SP">playground</a>)</p>
<p>Because <code>time.Time</code> implements <code>Comparer[time.Time]</code> it is now a valid type argument for this container, and we can still use the zero value as an empty container:</p>
<pre><code>var t MethodTree[time.Time]
t.Insert(time.Now())
</code></pre>
<p>For full flexibility, a library can provide all three API versions.
If we want to minimize repetition, all versions could use a shared implementation.
We could use the function version for that, as it is the most general:</p>
<pre><code>type node[E any] struct {
    value E
    left  *node[E]
    right *node[E]
}

func (n *node[E]) insert(cmp func(E, E) int, element E) *node[E] {
    if n == nil {
        return &amp;node[E]{value: element}
    }
    sign := cmp(element, n.value)
    switch {
    case sign &lt; 0:
        n.left = n.left.insert(cmp, element)
    case sign &gt; 0:
        n.right = n.right.insert(cmp, element)
    }
    return n
}

// Insert inserts element into the tree, if E implements cmp.Ordered.
func (t *Tree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(cmp.Compare[E], element)
}

// Insert inserts element into the tree, using the provided comparison function.
func (t *FuncTree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(t.cmp, element)
}

// Insert inserts element into the tree, if E implements Comparer[E].
func (t *MethodTree[E]) Insert(element E) {
    t.root = t.root.insert(E.Compare, element)
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/jzmoaH5eaIv">playground</a>)</p>
<p>An important observation here is that the shared implementation (the function-based variant) is not constrained in any way.
It must remain maximally flexible to serve as a common core.
We also do not store the comparison function in a struct field.
Instead, we pass it as a parameter because function arguments are easier for the compiler to analyze than struct fields.</p>
<p>There is still some amount of boilerplate involved, of course.
All the exported implementations need to replicate the full API with slightly different call patterns.
But this part is straightforward to write and to read.</p>
<h2 id="combining-methods-and-type-sets">Combining methods and type sets</h2>
<p>We can use our new tree data structure to implement an ordered set, providing element lookup in logarithmic time.
Let&rsquo;s now imagine we need to make lookup run in constant time; we might try to do this by maintaining an ordinary Go map alongside the tree:</p>
<pre><code>type OrderedSet[E Comparer[E]] struct {
    tree     MethodTree[E] // for efficient iteration in order
    elements map[E]bool    // for (near) constant time lookup
}

func (s *OrderedSet[E]) Has(e E) bool {
    return s.elements[e]
}

func (s *OrderedSet[E]) Insert(e E) {
    if s.elements == nil {
        s.elements = make(map[E]bool)
    }
    if s.elements[e] {
        return
    }
    s.elements[e] = true
    s.tree.Insert(e)
}

func (s *OrderedSet[E]) All() iter.Seq[E] {
    return func(yield func(E) bool) {
        s.tree.root.all(yield)
    }
}

func (n *node[E]) all(yield func(E) bool) bool {
    return n == nil || (n.left.all(yield) &amp;&amp; yield(n.value) &amp;&amp; n.right.all(yield))
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/TANUnnSnDqf">playground</a>)</p>
<p>However, compiling this code will produce an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>invalid map key type E (missing comparable constraint)</p>

<p>The error message tells us that we need to further constrain our type parameter to be able to use it as a map key.
The <code>comparable</code> constraint is a special predeclared constraint that is satisfied by all types for which the equality operators <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> are defined.
In Go, that is also the set of types which can be used as keys for the built-in <code>map</code> type.</p>
<p>We have three options to add this constraint to our type parameter, all with different tradeoffs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can <a href="/ref/spec#Embedded_interfaces">embed</a> <code>comparable</code> into our original <code>Comparer</code> definition (<a href="/play/p/g8NLjZCq97q">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code>type Comparer[E any] interface {
    comparable
    Compare(E) int
}
</code></pre>
<p>This has the downside that it would also make our <code>Tree</code> types only usable with types that are <code>comparable</code>.
In general, we do not want to unnecessarily restrict generic types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can add a new constraint definition (<a href="/play/p/Z2eg4X8xK5Z">playground</a>).</p>
<pre><code>type Comparer[E any] interface {
    Compare(E) int
}

type ComparableComparer[E any] interface {
    comparable
    Comparer[E]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is tidy, but it introduces a new identifier (<code>ComparableComparer</code>) into our API, and naming is hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can add the constraint inline into our more constrained type (<a href="/play/p/ZfggVma_jNc">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code>type OrderedSet[E interface {
    comparable
    Comparer[E]
}] struct {
    tree     Tree[E]
    elements map[E]struct{}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This can become a bit hard to read, especially if it needs to happen often.
It also makes it harder to reuse the constraint in other places.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of these to use is a style choice and ultimately up to personal preference.</p>
<h2 id="not-constraining-generic-interfaces">(Not) constraining generic interfaces</h2>
<p>At this point it is worth discussing constraints on generic interfaces.
You might want to define an interface for a generic container type.
For example, say you have an algorithm that requires a set data structure.
There are many different kinds of set implementations with different tradeoffs.
Defining an interface for the set operations you require can add flexibility to your package, leaving the decision of what tradeoffs are right for the specific application to the user:</p>
<pre><code>type Set[E any] interface {
    Insert(E)
    Delete(E)
    Has(E) bool
    All() iter.Seq[E]
}
</code></pre>
<p>A natural question here is what the constraint on this interface should be.
If possible, type parameters on generic interfaces should use <code>any</code> as a constraint, allowing arbitrary types.</p>
<p>From our discussions above, the reasons should be clear:
Different concrete implementations might require different constraints.
All the <code>Tree</code> types we have examined above, as well as the <code>OrderedSet</code> type, can implement <code>Set</code> for their element types, even though these types have different constraints.</p>
<p>The point of defining an interface is to leave the implementation up to the user.
Since one cannot predict what kinds of constraints a user may want to impose on their implementation, try to leave any constraints (stronger than <code>any</code>) to concrete implementations, not the interfaces.</p>
<h2 id="pointer-receivers">Pointer receivers</h2>
<p>Let us try to use the <code>Set</code> interface in an example.
Consider a function that removes duplicate elements in a sequence:</p>
<pre><code>// Unique removes duplicate elements from the input sequence, yielding only
// the first instance of any element.
func Unique[E comparable](input iter.Seq[E]) iter.Seq[E] {
    return func(yield func(E) bool) {
        seen := make(map[E]bool)
        for v := range input {
            if seen[v] {
                continue
            }
            if !yield(v) {
                return
            }
            seen[v] = true
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/hsYoFjkU9kA">playground</a>)</p>
<p>This uses a <code>map[E]bool</code> as a simple set of <code>E</code> elements.
Consequently, it works only for types that are <code>comparable</code> and which therefore define the built-in equality operators.
If we want to generalize this to arbitrary types, we need to replace that with a generic set:</p>
<pre><code>// Unique removes duplicate elements from the input sequence, yielding only
// the first instance of any element.
func Unique[E any](input iter.Seq[E]) iter.Seq[E] {
    return func(yield func(E) bool) {
        var seen Set[E]
        for v := range input {
            if seen.Has(v) {
                continue
            }
            if !yield(v) {
                return
            }
            seen.Insert(v)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/FZYPNf56nnY">playground</a>)</p>
<p>However, this does not work.
<code>Set[E]</code> is an interface type, and the <code>seen</code> variable will be initialized to <code>nil</code>.
We need to use a concrete implementation of the <code>Set[E]</code> interface.
But as we have seen in this post, there is no general implementation of a set that works for <code>any</code> element type.</p>
<p>We have to ask the user to provide a concrete implementation we can use, as an extra type parameter:</p>
<pre><code>// Unique removes duplicate elements from the input sequence, yielding only
// the first instance of any element.
func Unique[E any, S Set[E]](input iter.Seq[E]) iter.Seq[E] {
    return func(yield func(E) bool) {
        var seen S
        for v := range input {
            if seen.Has(v) {
                continue
            }
            if !yield(v) {
                return
            }
            seen.Insert(v)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/kjkGy5cNz8T">playground</a>)</p>
<p>However, if we instantiate this with our set implementation, we run into another problem:</p>
<pre><code>// OrderedSet[E] does not satisfy Set[E] (method All has pointer receiver)
Unique[E, OrderedSet[E]](slices.Values(s))
// panic: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
Unique[E, *OrderedSet[E]](slices.Values(s))
</code></pre>
<p>The first problem is clear from the error message: Our type constraint says that the type argument for <code>S</code> needs to implement the <code>Set[E]</code> interface.
And as the methods on <code>OrderedSet</code> use a pointer receiver, the type argument also has to be the pointer type.</p>
<p>When trying to do that, we run into the second problem.
This stems from the fact that we declare a variable in the implementation:</p>
<pre><code>var seen S
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>S</code> is <code>*OrderedSet[E]</code>, the variable is initialized with <code>nil</code>, as before.
Calling <code>seen.Insert</code> panics.</p>
<p>If we only have the pointer type, we cannot get a valid variable of the value type.
And if we only have the value type, we cannot call pointer-methods on it.
The consequence is that we need both the value <em>and</em> the pointer type.
So we have to introduce an additional type parameter <code>PS</code> with a new constraint <code>PtrToSet</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// PtrToSet is implemented by a pointer type implementing the Set[E] interface.
type PtrToSet[S, E any] interface {
    *S
    Set[E]
}

// Unique removes duplicate elements from the input sequence, yielding only
// the first instance of any element.
func Unique[E, S any, PS PtrToSet[S, E]](input iter.Seq[E]) iter.Seq[E] {
    return func(yield func(E) bool) {
        // We convert to PS, as only that is constrained to have the methods.
        // The conversion is allowed, because the type set of PS only contains *S.
        seen := PS(new(S))
        for v := range input {
            if seen.Has(v) {
                continue
            }
            if !yield(v) {
                return
            }
            seen.Insert(v)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/Kp1jJRVjmYa">playground</a>)</p>
<p>The trick here is the connection of the two type parameters in the function signature via the extra type parameter on the <code>PtrToSet</code> interface.
<code>S</code> itself is unconstrained, but <code>PS</code> must have type <code>*S</code> and it must have the methods we need.
So effectively, we are restricting <code>S</code> to have some methods, but those methods need to use a pointer receiver.</p>
<p>While the definition of a function with this kind of constraint requires an additional type parameter, importantly this does not complicate code using it:
as long as this extra type parameter is at the end of the type parameter list, it <a href="/blog/type-inference">can be inferred</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// The third type argument is inferred to be *OrderedSet[int]
Unique[int, OrderedSet[int]](slices.Values(s))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a general pattern, and worth remembering: for when you encounter it in someone else&rsquo;s work, or when you want to use it in your own.</p>
<pre><code>func SomeFunction[T any, PT interface{ *T; SomeMethods }]()
</code></pre>
<p>If you have two type parameters, where one is constrained to be a pointer to the other, the constraint ensures that the relevant methods use a pointer receiver.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-constrain-to-pointer-receivers">Should you constrain to pointer receivers?</h2>
<p>At this point, you might feel pretty overwhelmed.
This is rather complicated and it seems unreasonable to expect every Go programmer to understand what is going on in this function signature.
We also had to introduce yet more names into our API.
When people cautioned against adding generics to Go in the first place, this is one of the things they were worried about.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself entangled in these problems, it is worth taking a step back.
We can often avoid this complexity by thinking about our problem in a different way.
In this example, we built a function that takes an <code>iter.Seq[E]</code> and returns an <code>iter.Seq[E]</code> with the unique elements.
But to do the deduplication, we needed to collect the unique elements into a set.
And as this requires us to allocate the space for the entire result, we do not really benefit from representing the result as a stream.</p>
<p>If we rethink this problem, we can avoid the extra type parameter altogether by using <code>Set[E]</code> as a regular interface value:</p>
<pre><code>// InsertAll adds all unique elements from seq into set.
func InsertAll[E any](set Set[E], seq iter.Seq[E]) {
    for v := range seq {
        set.Insert(v)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/woZcHodAgaa">playground</a>)</p>
<p>By using <code>Set</code> as a plain interface type, it is clear that the caller has to provide a valid value of their concrete implementation.
This is a very common pattern.
And if they need an <code>iter.Seq[E]</code>, they can simply call <code>All()</code> on the <code>set</code> to obtain one.</p>
<p>This complicates things for callers slightly, but it has another advantage over the constraint to pointer receivers:
remember that we started with a <code>map[E]bool</code> as a simple set type.
It is easy to implement the <code>Set[E]</code> interface on that basis:</p>
<pre><code>type HashSet[E comparable] map[E]bool

func (s HashSet[E]) Insert(v E)       { s[v] = true }
func (s HashSet[E]) Delete(v E)       { delete(s, v) }
func (s HashSet[E]) Has(v E) bool     { return s[v] }
func (s HashSet[E]) All() iter.Seq[E] { return maps.Keys(s) }
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="/play/p/KPPpWa7M93d">playground</a>)</p>
<p>This implementation does not use pointer receivers.
So while this is perfectly valid, it would not be usable with the complicated constraint to pointer receivers.
But it works fine with our <code>InsertAll</code> version.
As with many constraints, enforcing that methods use a pointer receiver might actually be overly restrictive for many practical use cases.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this illustrates some of the patterns and trade-offs that type parameters on interfaces enable.
It is a powerful tool, but it also comes with a cost.
The primary take-aways are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use generic interfaces to express constraints on the receiver by using them self-referentially.</li>
<li>Use them to create constrained relationships between different type parameters.</li>
<li>Use them to abstract over different implementations with different kinds of constraints.</li>
<li>When you find yourself in a situation where you need to constrain to pointer receivers, consider whether you can refactor your code to avoid the extra complexity. See <a href="#should-you-constrain-to-pointer-receivers">&ldquo;Should you constrain to pointer receivers?&rdquo;</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, do not over-engineer things: a less flexible but simpler and more readable solution may ultimately be the wiser choice.</p>

It provides access to a special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance and offers in-place write access to its content.</p> </blockquote> <p>‚Äì <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system">MDN</a></p> <p>Essentially, OPFS gives webpages a directory that only they can write to and read from. These are real files written to a real directory on your computer and you can use it for all kinds of filesystem-ey things. (Although browsers add a bunch of buffers in between you and actually writing to the file, so from the webpage&#39;s perspective all writes are atomic and are slightly slower than writing natively would be.)</p> <p>iOS and MacOS users on Developer Beta 2 of their respective platforms can now fully use this API since Apple has finally gotten around to finishing supporting it.</p> <p>Since you&#39;re in this subreddit, you may want to do this from Rust (e.g. you&#39;re writing a webapp in Dioxsus). For that, you can use my library `<a href="https://crates.io/crates/opfs">opfs</a>`. This is an announcement post for a new version of that library, which now has everything figured out for you, including working around some fun bugs recently introduced in Safari&#39;s WASM interpreter. The library also supports native platforms (using tokio instead of opfs when not compiling to wasm) and implements a virtual in-memory filesystem for tests.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Rustaceans!</p> <p>I built a transcription app with Tauri and the Rust performance benefits have been incredible. I wish all Electron apps were built with this framework.</p> <p>What impressed me most about Tauri: the final bundle is just 22MB on macOS and starts instantly. Near-zero idle CPU. Compare that to Electron apps that start at 150MB+ just to show &quot;Hello World&quot;. Slack on my machine is over 490MB, which is crazy.</p> <p>The beauty of Tauri is that many common functions (like <code>fs</code>, <code>fetch</code>, <code>shell</code>) are implemented in Rust and exposed as JavaScript APIs. It feels almost Node-like‚Äîthe functions you&#39;d rely on in server-side Node have Rust equivalents that you can call directly from JavaScript. This gives you native performance without needing to write and register your own Tauri commands and invoke them from the frontend for every basic operation. But I still had to write quite a bit of my own Rust for platform-specific features, which has been really fun. Organizing the bridge between TypeScript and Rust has been an interesting challenge.</p> <p>For example, I needed to handle macOS accessibility permissions. While Tauri provides most of what you need, some features require custom Rust code:</p> <pre><code>#[tauri::command] pub fn is_macos_accessibility_enabled(ask_if_not_allowed: bool) -&gt; Result&lt;bool, &amp;&#39;static str&gt; { let options = create_options_dictionary(ask_if_not_allowed)?; let is_allowed = unsafe { AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions(options) }; release_options_dictionary(options); Ok(is_allowed) } </code></pre> <p>The <code>#[tauri::command]</code> macro makes it seamless to call this from TypeScript. The full implementation (<a href="https://github.com/braden-w/whispering/blob/main/apps/app/src-tauri/src/accessibility.rs">accessibility.rs</a>) can be found here.</p> <p>Tauri&#39;s IPC is blazing fast‚Äîthe Rust backend handles server-side-like operations, while the frontend stays static and lightweight. We achieved 97% code sharing between desktop and web by using dependency injection at build time.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/braden-w/whispering">https://github.com/braden-w/whispering</a></p> <p>Happy to dive into implementation details or discuss Tauri patterns.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Working on some code recently I wanted to use a self-defined interface that represents <code>*slog.Logger</code> instead of directly using slog. Ignoring if that&#39;s advisable or not, I did run into something about go that is confusing to me and I hope that someone with deeper knowledge around the language design could explain the rational.</p> <p>If my terminology is slightly off, please forgive, conceptually I&#39;ll assume you understand. </p> <p>If I define an interface and a struct conforms to the interface then I can use the struct instance to populate variables of the interface type. But if the interface has a function that returns an interface (self-referential or not), it seems that the inplementing receiver function has to directly use that interface in it&#39;s signature. My expectation would be that an implementuing receiver func could return <em>anything</em> that fulfilled the interface declared in the main interface function.</p> <p>Here&#39;s some quick code made by Claude to demonstrate what I would expect to work:</p> <p>``` type Builder interface { With(key, value string) Builder Build() map[string]string }</p> <p>type ConcreteBuilder struct { data map[string]string }</p> <p>func (c ConcreteBuilder) With(key, value string) ConcreteBuilder { // NOP return c }</p> <p>func (c ConcreteBuilder) Build() map[string]string { return c.data }</p> <p>var _ Builder = ConcreteBuilder{} ```</p> <p>This, of course, does not work. My confusion is <em>why</em> is this not supported. Given the semantics around interfaces and how they apply post-hoc, I would expect that if the interface has a func (<code>With</code> in this case) returning an interface (<code>Builder</code> in this case) that any implementation that has a func returning a type that confirms to <em>that</em> interface would be valid.</p> <p>Again, I&#39;m looking for feedback about the rational for not supporting this, not a pointer to the language spec where this is clearly (?) not supported.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nashkara"> /u/nashkara </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lu0ytr/go_selfreferential_interface_confusion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lu0ytr/go_selfreferential_interface_confusion/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About 8 months ago, we were hitting a wall with the usual microservice messaging complexities. We had around a dozen services, each needing to coordinate via message passing‚Äîthings like retries, error handling, and traceability were taking up more code than the actual business logic.</p> <p>We initially started with Kafka (because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what big companies use‚Äù), we even visited some AWS native stuff (don`t get me started) but for our scale and latency needs, it was overkill‚Äîboth operationally and in terms of developer overhead. We eventually moved to RabbitMQ, which helped a bit, but managing connections, dead-letter queues, retry logic, and health checks was still repetitive and brittle.</p> <p>We needed something that:</p> <ul> <li>Removed boilerplate</li> <li>Standardized retry and DLQ handling</li> <li>Enabled stage-based workflows (Saga patterns)</li> <li>Integrated with Prometheus and tracing</li> <li>Made messaging approachable for less experienced devs</li> </ul> <p>That led me to create <a href="https://github.com/glimte/mmate-go">mmate-go</a>, a framework inspired by MATS3 in the Java ecosystem, but built natively for Go for RabbitMQ. Initially we started writing mmate in dotnet, but we`ve had several rounds of architectural decision makings before ending up with go and the published version is a refined rewritten version from that. We have some refactoring that needs to be done but eventually we are going to publish that version as well when we get the time. This is messaging with RabbitMQ made easy with enterprise functionality.</p> <p>Where mmate-go really shines is with <strong>StageFlow</strong>, our pipeline model for distributed workflows. Inspired by the saga pattern but without the orchestration overhead, it lets you define each stage of a process‚Äîand what to do if something goes wrong.</p> <p><code>pipeline := stageflow.NewPipelineBuilder().</code><br/> <code>AddStage(&quot;validate&quot;, validateOrder).</code><br/> <code>AddStage(&quot;reserve&quot;, reserveInventory).</code><br/> <code>AddStage(&quot;payment&quot;, processPayment).</code><br/> <code>AddStage(&quot;fulfill&quot;, fulfillOrder).</code><br/> <code>WithCompensation(&quot;payment&quot;, refundPayment).</code><br/> <code>WithCompensation(&quot;reserve&quot;, releaseInventory).</code><br/> <code>WithCompensation(&quot;fulfill&quot;, restoreInventory).</code><br/> <code>Build()</code><br/> <code>engine.ExecutePipeline(ctx, orderData, pipeline)</code></p> <p>Each stage runs independently, and the entire <strong>message state travels with the pipeline</strong>, so if a failure happens mid-way, the compensation logic has <strong>everything it needs</strong> to roll back:<br/> <code>func refundPayment(ctx context.Context, state *OrderState) error {</code><br/> <code>return paymentService.Refund(state.PaymentID, state.Amount</code><br/> <code>}</code></p> <p>No external state stores. No external orchestrator. The pipeline <strong>resumes after crashes</strong> using persisted RabbitMQ messages. This has drastically reduced our inconsistent-state bugs and eliminated our need for a separate saga service.</p> <p>Sometimes we need to call async services from sync contexts (like HTTP handlers). Normally you‚Äôd fire-and-forget and hope for the best. With mmate-go‚Äôs <strong>SyncAsyncBridge</strong>, you can write code like this:<br/> <code>result, err := client.Bridge().RequestReply(ctx, InventoryCheckRequest{</code><br/> <code>ProductID: &quot;123&quot;,</code><br/> <code>Quantity: 5,</code><br/> <code>}, 30*time.Second)</code></p> <p>It‚Äôs still asynchronous under the hood, but you get request persistence, guaranteed retries, crash recovery, correlated responses. It‚Äôs like having distributed transactions, but without the database lock hell.</p> <p>We are in the process of migrating most of our services to use mmate-go, and our message-related bugs and ad-hoc fixes have dropped noticeably. The learning curve for new team members is also much smoother now.</p> <p>It‚Äôs intentionally opinionated, but that‚Äôs worked in our favor by enforcing consistent patterns and reducing decision fatigue.</p> <p>Curious if others here have tried solving similar problems‚Äîespecially those still using RabbitMQ directly. Would love to hear how others approach message orchestration in Go.</p> <p>Edit: We also made an CLI tool for dev`s to inspect schema publishing and basic metrics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tek-_"> /u/tek-_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltypbf/message_mate_mmatego_for_reliable_microservices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltypbf/message_mate_mmatego_for_reliable_microservices/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, how are you? hope you are fine :)</p> <p>I have been working on this component, part of a much bigger project (an <a href="https://medium.com/@earcamone/what-about-an-open-source-bigtech-style-development-ecosystem-for-go-024263853a35">open-source BigTech style development ecosystem</a> for Go), a &quot;clone and forget&quot; full-featured CI/CD Pipeline called <a href="https://github.com/earcamone/gwy">GWY</a> (Go Workflow Yourself) for your Go APIs using GitHub Actions.</p> <p>You just clone it and out of the box, though you can easily edit the config flags to enable, disable and or customize its actions, it performs the following tasks:</p> <ul> <li>unit tests and coverage check</li> <li>hardcoded secrets scan</li> <li>vulnerabilities scan</li> <li>outdated dependencies scan</li> <li>gofmt and linting scan</li> <li>automatic generation and update of documentation badges</li> <li>release push to AWS/ECR (more platforms coming soon)</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, if you happen not to be ready to include the CI pipeline block in your development ecosystem, the CI and all its independent tasks can be run manually until you decide to integrate it in your Pull Requests cycle.</p> <p>Each Action summary includes a -hopefully- cool looking report, with clickable errors pointing to the line of code triggering the alerts (a lot of work to parse the outputs and generate the reports), markdown artifacts evidence, etc..</p> <p>Anyway, this project took some months of full-time time development, it&#39;s exhaustively tested, was wondering if anyone would like to give it a try and give me some feedback?</p> <p>At the end of the day, the idea is having a project that you can for example add in your master branch bootstrapping commit and reuse for each project you start and you know you can forget about the CI part, its all solved for you and you can easily tune it up to include / exclude actions or set parameters by changing some config flags.</p> <p>Thanks for the opportunity of sharing,<br/> Love this forum, take care, cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/earcamonearg"> /u/earcamonearg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltxx72/developed_a_fullfeatured_clone_and_forget_cicd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltxx72/developed_a_fullfeatured_clone_and_forget_cicd/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>hello, I have a webrtc + websocket backend server which purpose is like a podcast ( live audio chat), i have created a html/js frontend bare minimum to test its functionality manually, I also want to add like unit testing especially for the webrtc part. I read about writing a test client program which will open a websocket and webrtc in a test file. Is there any way or tools i can use to speed up the process? I would like to test whether audio stream are going where it need to be or not and such . Thank you in advance.</p> <p>edit 1: i think people are a bit confused on what i am asking, might be because of my english. I had already done the POC testing and already got what i want in that POC. What I want is how to test only the backend (server) without frontend. Is there any way to test like that? I already found out that I can write a another client to micmick the frontend part so I also would like to know if there are anyway I can speed that testing part.</p> <p>For more context - I use this example - <a href="https://github.com/pion/example-webrtc-applications/tree/master/sfu-ws">sfu-ws</a> (which isn&#39;t inside their <a href="http://README.md">README.md</a> for some reason) to build. The purpose of my POC is to integrate the features into my work project but I wanted to test outside before actually integrating. My work has a dedicated frontend team but I don&#39;t want and not allow to push the code without testing the functionality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Altruistic_Let_8036"> /u/Altruistic_Let_8036 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltruv1/webrtc_testing_advices_pion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltruv1/webrtc_testing_advices_pion/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is as adding chain to chain and get final result (for Gmail API is each part is adding another filter for example). I am interesting what is it feature of Go and how implement itself. For first sight it seems like simple function which get all data, modyfing part (by pointer maybe?) and return it further.</p> <p>I tried dig inside it by source code and I found out interface:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/vbauerster/mpb/blob/master/bar_filler_bar.go#L75">https://github.com/vbauerster/mpb/blob/master/bar_filler_bar.go#L75</a></p> <p><code>type BarStyleComposer interface {</code></p> <pre><code>`Lbound(string) BarStyleComposer` </code></pre> <p><code>LboundMeta(func(string) string) BarStyleComposer</code></p> <pre><code>`Rbound(string) BarStyleComposer` `Filler(string) BarStyleComposer` `Padding(string) BarStyleComposer` `PaddingMeta(func(string) string) BarStyleComposer` </code></pre> <p><code>...</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p>when for example I find out implementation:</p> <p><code>type barStyle struct {</code></p> <pre><code>`style [iLen]string` `metas [iLen]func(string) string` `tipFrames []string` `tipOnComplete bool` `rev` </code></pre> <p><code>func BarStyle() BarStyleComposer {</code></p> <pre><code>`bs := barStyle{` `style: defaultBarStyle,` `tipFrames: []string{defaultBarStyle[iTip]},` `}` `return bs` </code></pre> <p><code>}</code></p> <p><code>func (s barStyle) Lbound(bound string) BarStyleComposer {</code></p> <pre><code>`s.style[iLbound] = bound` `return s` </code></pre> <p><code>}</code></p> <p><code>func (s barStyle) LboundMeta(fn func(string) string) BarStyleComposer {</code></p> <pre><code>`s.metas[iLbound] = fn` `return s` </code></pre> <p><code>}</code></p> <p><code>...</code></p> <p>So barStyle is skeleton for handling chaining functionality. Engine is func BarStyle and Lbound meta is implementation of interface for specific type based on map passed between all function which is skeleton struct if I understand it correctly.</p> <p>I want create chain when one function chained is too another to modify something - let say image or text without specific order of functions in mind. Could anyone get me some pointers how do it and what I miss here in my reasoning?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/pepiks"> /u/pepiks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltctmo/chain_like_code_syntax_recognition/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ltctmo/chain_like_code_syntax_recognition/">[comments]</a></span></div>
