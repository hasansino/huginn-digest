It would be nice if I could generify it somehow - but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible?</p> <p>What it does mean is that now in another part of the app I can define all the business logic for validation, including a generic IsValid type API for DataPoints in my application. The goal there being to roll it up into something like this:</p> <pre><code>impl Aggregate for Contact { fn is_valid(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Vec&lt;ValidationError&gt;&gt; { ... // validate each typed field with their own is_valid() and return Ok(()) OR a Vec of specific errors. } </code></pre> <p>Does anyone else do something similar? Is this too complicated?</p> <p>The final API is what I am after here -- just wondering if this is an idiomatic way to compose it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maxinstuff"> /u/maxinstuff </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9lkaj/question_re_practices_in_regard_to_domain_object/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9lkaj/question_re_practices_in_regard_to_domain_object/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>What is it?</strong></p> <p>Mkdev is a CLI tool that I made to simplify creating new projects in languages that are boilerplate-heavy. I was playing around with a lot of different languages and frameworks last summer during my data science research, and I got tired of writing the boilerplate for Beamer in LaTeX, or writing Nix shells. I remembered being taught Makefile in class at Uni, but that didn&#39;t quite meet my needs--it was kind of the wrong tool for the job.</p> <p><strong>What does mkdev try to do?</strong></p> <p>The overall purpose of mkdev is to write boilerplate once, allowing for simple-user defined substitutions (like the date at the time of pasting the boilerplate, etc.). For rust itself, this is ironically pretty useless. The features I want are already build into cargo (`cargo new [--lib]`). But for other languages that don&#39;t have the same tooling, it has been helpful.</p> <p><strong>What do I hope to gain by sharing this?</strong></p> <p>Mkdev is not intended to appeal to a widespread need, it fills a particular niche in the particular way that I like it (think git&#39;s early development). That being said, I do want to make it as good as possible, and ideally get some feedback on my work. So this is just here to give the project a bit more visibility, and see if maybe some like-minded people are interested by it. If you have criticisms or suggestions, I&#39;m happy to hear them; just please be kind.</p> <p>If you got this far, thanks for reading this!</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/mkdev">crates.io</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/4jamesccraven/mkdev">repo</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/4jamesccraven/mkdev/wiki">documentation</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting_Name9221"> /u/Interesting_Name9221 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9l1sa/mkdev_i_rewrote_my_old_python_project_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9l1sa/mkdev_i_rewrote_my_old_python_project_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a semi-big project with a full GUI, wiki renderer, etc. However, I&#39;m wondering what if I break the UI and Backend into its own crate? Would that improve compile time using <code>--release</code>?</p> <p>I have limited knowledge about the Rust compiler&#39;s process. However, from my limited understanding, when building the final binary (i.e., not building crates), it typically recompiles the entire project and all associated <code>.rs</code> files before linking everything together. The idea is that if I divide my project into sub-crates and use workspace, then only the necessary sub-crates will be recompiled the rest will be linked, rather than the entire project compiling everything each time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EtherealPlatitude"> /u/EtherealPlatitude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9ihhn/does_breaking_a_mediumlarge_size_project_down/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9ihhn/does_breaking_a_mediumlarge_size_project_down/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks!</p> <p>Been working on Duva, our distributed key-value store powered by Rust. One of the absolute core components, especially when building something strongly consistent with Raft like we are, is the <strong>Replicated Log</strong>. It&#39;s where every operation lives, ensuring durability, enabling replication, and allowing nodes to recover.</p> <p>Writing to the log (appending) is usually straightforward. The real challenge, and where we learned a big lesson, came with <strong>reading from it efficiently</strong>, especially when you need a specific <em>range</em> of historical operations from a potentially huge log file.</p> <p><strong>The Problem &amp; The First Lesson Learned: Don&#39;t Be Naive!</strong></p> <p>Initially, we thought segmenting the log into smaller files was enough to manage size. It helps with cleanup, sure. But imagine needing operations 1000-1050 from a log that&#39;s tens of gigabytes, split into multi-megabyte segments.</p> <p>Our first thought (the naive one):</p> <ol> <li>Figure out which segments <em>might</em> contain the range.</li> <li>Read those segment files into memory.</li> <li>Filter in memory for the operations you actually need.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> This is incredibly wasteful! You&#39;re pulling potentially <em>gigabytes</em> of data off disk and into RAM, only to throw most of it away. It murders your I/O throughput and wastes CPU cycles processing irrelevant data. For a performance-critical system component, this just doesn&#39;t fly as the log grows.</p> <p><strong>The Solution &amp; The Second Lesson Learned: Index Everything Critical!</strong></p> <p>The fix? <strong>In-memory lookups (indexing) for each segment.</strong> For every segment file, we build a simple map (think <code>Log Index -&gt; Byte Offset</code>) stored in memory. This little index is tiny compared to the segment file itself.</p> <p><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> For frequent lookups or range reads on large sequential data stores, a small index that tells you <em>exactly where to start reading</em> on disk is a game-changer. It&#39;s like having a detailed page index for a massive book ‚Äì you don&#39;t skim the whole chapter; you jump straight to the page you need.</p> <p>How it works for a range read (like 1000-1050):</p> <ol> <li>Find the relevant segment(s).</li> <li>Use our in-memory lookup for that segment (it&#39;s sorted, so a fast binary search works!) to find the byte offset of the first operation <em>at or before</em> log index 1000.</li> <li>Instead of reading the whole segment file, we tell the OS: &quot;Go to <em>this exact byte position</em>&quot;.</li> <li>Read operations sequentially <em>from that point</em>, stopping once we&#39;re past index 1050.</li> </ol> <p>This dramatically reduces the amount of data we read and process.</p> <p><strong>Why Rust Was Key (Especially When Lessons Require Refactoring)</strong></p> <p>This is perhaps the biggest benefit of building something like this in Rust, especially when you&#39;re iterating on the design:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Confidence in Refactoring:</strong> We initially implemented the log reading differently. When we realized the naive approach wasn&#39;t cutting it and needed this SIGNIFICANT refactor to the indexed, seek-based method, <strong>Rust gave us immense confidence</strong>. You know the feeling of dread refactoring a complex, performance-sensitive component in other languages, worrying about introducing subtle memory bugs or race conditions? With Rust, the <em>compiler has your back</em>. If it compiles after a big refactor, it&#39;s <em>very likely</em> to be correct regarding memory safety and type correctness. This significantly lowers the pain and worry associated with evolving the design when you realize the initial implementation needs a fundamental change.</li> <li><strong>Unlocking True Algorithmic Potential:</strong> Coming from a Python background myself, I know you can design algorithmically perfect solutions, but sometimes the language itself introduces a performance floor that you just can&#39;t break through for truly demanding tasks. Python is great for many things, but for bottom-line, high-throughput system components like this log, you can hit a wall. Rust removes that limitation. It gives you the control to implement that efficient seek-and-read strategy <em>exactly</em> as the algorithm dictates, ensuring that the algorithmic efficiency translates directly into runtime performance. What you can <em>conceive</em> algorithmically, you can <em>achieve</em> performantly with Rust, with virtually no limits imposed by the language runtime overhead.</li> <li><strong>Performance &amp; Reliability:</strong> Zero-cost abstractions and no GC pauses are critical for a core component like the log, where consistent, low-latency performance is needed for Raft. Rust helps build a system that is not only fast but also reliable at runtime due to its strong guarantees.</li> </ol> <p>This optimized approach also plays much nicer with the OS page cache ‚Äì by only reading relevant bytes, we reduce cache pollution and increase the chances that the data we <em>do</em> need is already in fast memory.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Optimizing read paths for growing data structures like a replicated log is crucial but often overlooked until performance becomes an issue. Learning to leverage indexing and seeking over naive full-segment reads was a key step. But just as importantly, building it in Rust meant we could significantly refactor our approach when needed with much less risk and pain, thanks to the compiler acting as a powerful safety net.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested in distributed systems, Raft, or seeing how these kinds of low-level optimizations and safe refactoring practices play out in Rust, check out the Duva project on GitHub!</p> <p><strong>Repo Link:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Migorithm/duva">https://github.com/Migorithm/duva</a></p> <p>We&#39;re actively developing and would love any feedback, contributions, or just a star ‚≠ê if you find the project interesting!</p> <p>Happy coding!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/letmegomigo"> /u/letmegomigo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9cxjh/lesson_learned_how_we_tackled_the_pain_of_reading/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k9cxjh/lesson_learned_how_we_tackled_the_pain_of_reading/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everybody,</p> <p>I&#39;m currently writing a vim-inspired, graphical text editor in Rust. So just like neovim I want to add scripting capabilities to my editor. For the scripting language I chose <a href="https://rhai.rs/">rhai</a>, as it seems like a good option for Rust programs. The current structure of my editor looks something like this: (this is heavily simplified)</p> <pre><code>struct Buffer { filename: Option&lt;PathBuf&gt;, cursor_char: usize, cursor_line: usize, lines: Vec&lt;String&gt;, } impl Buffer { fn move_right(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ } fn delete_char(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ } /* ... */ } type BufferID = usize; struct Window { bufid: Option&lt;BufferID&gt;, } struct Editor { buffers: Vec&lt;Buffers&gt;, mode: Mode, should_quit: bool, windows: Vec&lt;Window&gt;, } </code></pre> <p>Now I want to be able to use the buffer API in the scripting language</p> <pre><code>struct Application { // the scripting engine engine: Engine, // editor is in Rc because both the engine and the Application need to have mutable access to it editor: Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Editor&gt;&gt;, } fn new() { /* ... */ // adding a function to the scripting enviroment engine.register_fn(&quot;buf_move_right&quot;, move |bufid: i64| { // get a reference to the buffer using the ID let mut editor = editor.borrow_mut(); editor .buffers .get_mut(bufid) .unwrap() .move_right(); }); /* ... */ } </code></pre> <p>First I tried just passing a reference to <code>Editor</code> into the scripting environment, which doesn&#39;t really work because of the borrowchecker. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve switched to using ID&#39;s for identifying buffers just like Vim.</p> <p>The issue is that I now need to write a bunch of boilerplate for registering functions with the scripting engine, and right now there&#39;s more than like 20 methods in the <code>Buffer</code> struct.</p> <p>That&#39;s when I thought it might be a good idea to automatically generate all of this boilerplate using procedural macros. The problem is only that a function first appears in the impl-Block of the <code>Buffer</code> struct, and must be registered in the constructor of <code>Application</code>.</p> <p>My current strategy is to create a stateful procedural macro, that keeps track of all functions using a <code>static mut</code> variable. I know this isn&#39;t optimal, so I wonder if anyone has a better idea of doing this.</p> <p>I know that Neovim solves this issue by running a Lua script that automatically generated all of this boilerplate, but I&#39;d like to do it using macros inside of the Rust language.</p> <p>TL;DR</p> <p>I need to generate some Rust boilerplate in 2 different places, using a procedural macro. What&#39;s the best way to implement a stateful procmacro? (possibly without <code>static mut</code>)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lukasx_"> /u/lukasx_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k93iat/stateful_macro_for_generating_api_bindings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k93iat/stateful_macro_for_generating_api_bindings/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Debugging Windows-targeted Rust applications on Linux can be challenging, especially when using Wine. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to set up remote debugging using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Wine, and <code>gdbserver</code>.</p> <h2>Prerequisites</h2> <p>Before proceeding, ensure the following packages are installed on your Linux system:</p> <ul> <li><strong>gdb-mingw-w64</strong>: Provides the GNU Debugger for Windows targets.</li> <li><strong>gdb-mingw-w64-target</strong>: Supplies <code>gdbserver.exe</code> and related tools for Windows debugging.</li> </ul> <p>On Debian-based systems, you can install these packages using:</p> <p><code>bash sudo apt install gdb-mingw-w64 gdb-mingw-w64-target </code></p> <p>On Arch-based systems, you can install these packages using: <code>shell sudo pacman -S mingw-w64-gdb mingw-w64-gdb-target </code></p> <p>After installation, <code>gdbserver.exe</code> will be available in <code>/usr/share/win64/</code>. In Wine, this path is accessible via the <code>Z:</code> drive, which maps to the root of your Linux filesystem. Therefore, within Wine, the path to <code>gdbserver.exe</code> is <code>Z:/usr/share/win64/gdbserver.exe</code>.</p> <h2>Setting Up VS Code for Debugging</h2> <p>To streamline the debugging process, we&#39;ll configure VS Code with the necessary tasks and launch configurations.</p> <h3>1.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! üëã</p> <p>I&#39;d like to share a Go library I&#39;ve built called <a href="https://github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree">go-lrutree</a>. It&#39;s a small, thread-safe, generic cache designed specifically for tree-structured data.</p> <p><strong>The Problem It Solves:</strong></p> <p>Popular LRU cache implementations (like hashicorp/golang-lru) work well for flat key-value pairs.</p> <p>But when you‚Äôre working with hierarchical data - think org charts, file paths, category trees, or geo-locations - flat caching can fall short.</p> <p>For example: if you cache a city, you likely want its state and country to remain cached too. But traditional LRU eviction might evict a parent while children remain, breaking the logical structure.</p> <p>go-lrutree solves this by enforcing the rule: <strong>if a node is in the cache, all its ancestors are too</strong>. When you access a node, its entire ancestry is marked as recently used - keeping the chain intact and eviction-safe.</p> <p><strong>Usage example:</strong></p> <p>```go package main</p> <p>import ( &quot;fmt&quot;</p> <pre><code>&quot;github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree&quot; </code></pre> <p>)</p> <p>func main() { cache := lrutree.NewCache[string, string](1000)</p> <pre><code>_ = cache.AddRoot(&quot;company&quot;, &quot;My Company&quot;) _ = cache.Add(&quot;engineering_department&quot;, &quot;Engineering Department&quot;, &quot;company&quot;) _ = cache.Add(&quot;frontend_team&quot;, &quot;Frontend Team&quot;, &quot;engineering_department&quot;) _ = cache.Add(&quot;backend_team&quot;, &quot;Backend Team&quot;, &quot;engineering_department&quot;) // &quot;frontend_team&quot; node and all its ancestors (&quot;engineering_department&quot; and &quot;company&quot; nodes) are marked as recently used. if cacheNode, ok := cache.Get(&quot;frontend_team&quot;); ok { fmt.Printf(&quot;Get: %s (key=%s, parent=%s)\n&quot;, cacheNode.Value, cacheNode.Key, cacheNode.ParentKey) // Output: Get: Frontend Team (key=frontend_team, parent=engineering_department) } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>Please check the <a href="https://github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree/blob/main/README.md">project&#39;s readme</a> to see the full usage example.</p> <p><strong>Looking for Feedback!</strong></p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear from the Go community:</p> <ul> <li>Does this hierarchical caching concept resonate with you? Can you envision use cases for it?</li> <li>Any feedback on the API design or the implementation approach?</li> <li>Suggestions for improvements or features?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vasayxtx"> /u/vasayxtx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k9e09d/golrutree_hierarchical_lru_caching_library_for_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k9e09d/golrutree_hierarchical_lru_caching_library_for_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

For example, with deep completion enabled, typing <code>&#39;cha&#39;</code> could suggest <code>&#39;rand.NewChaCha8()&#39;</code> as a possible completion option - but that is not the case no matter how high the completion budget is set for <code>gopls</code>.</p> <p><strong>How?</strong></p> <p>Query <code>gopls&#39;s</code> <code>workspace/symbol</code> endpoint, convert the resulting symbols into <code>completionItemKinds</code>, filter the results to only include the ones that are unimported, then finally feed them back into <code>nvim-cmp</code> / <code>blink.cmp</code></p> <p>This has been the feature that I missed the most ever since I switched to Neovim from GoLand. I tried pretty much every plugin out there, but apparently none of them support deep completions for unimported packages (except coc.nvim but &#39;don&#39;t like it much).</p> <p>Still not sure if gopls natively supports this feature, but it seemed easier to just make this plugin than navigate through the labyrinth of incomplete docs trying to enable this.</p> <p>Yes, the performance is terrible on huge codebases (e.g; kubernetes); probably why it&#39;s not enabled by default.</p> <p>Suggestions/Contributions welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nefariousIntentions7"> /u/nefariousIntentions7 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k99sqn/neovim_plugin_cmpgodeep_a_deep_completion_source/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k99sqn/neovim_plugin_cmpgodeep_a_deep_completion_source/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve created image ready to test code, so I simply copy files on the container, start it, wait for it to finish, and get the logs. The logic is the following ``` defer func() { if err != nil { StopAndRemove(ctx, cli, ctn) } }() archive, err := createTarArchive(files) // FIX: error here err = cli.CopyToContainer(ctx, ctn, &quot;/&quot;, archive, container.CopyToContainerOptions{}) startTime := time.Now() err = cli.ContainerStart(ctx, ctn, container.StartOptions{}) statusCh, errCh := cli.ContainerWait(ctx, ctn, container.WaitConditionNotRunning) logs, err := cli.ContainerLogs(ctx, ctn, container.LogsOptions{ ShowStdout: true, ShowStderr: false, Since: startTime.Format(time.RFC3339), }) defer logs.Close() var logBytes bytes.Buffer _, err = io.Copy(&amp;logBytes, logs)</p> <p>```</p> <p>I removed error management, comments and logs from the snippet to keep it short and easily understandable even if you don&#39;t know Go well. Most of the time there&#39;s no issue.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I‚Äôm trying to think through a design problem and would love some advice. I‚Äôll first explain it in Python terms because that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from, and then map it to Go.</p> <p>Let‚Äôs say I have a function that internally calls other functions that produce side effects. In Python, when I write tests for such functions, I usually do one of two things:</p> <h3>(1) Using mock.patch</h3> <p>Here‚Äôs an example where I mock the side-effect generating function at test time:</p> <p>```</p> <h1>app.py</h1> <p>def send_email(user): # Imagine this sends a real email pass</p> <p>def register_user(user): # Some logic send_email(user) return True ```</p> <p>Then to test it: </p> <p>```</p> <h1>test_app.py</h1> <p>from unittest import mock from app import register_user</p> <p>@mock.patch(&#39;app.send_email&#39;) def test_register_user(mock_send_email): result = register_user(&quot;Alice&quot;) mock_send_email.assert_called_once_with(&quot;Alice&quot;) assert result is True ```</p> <h3>(2) Using dependency injection</h3> <p>Alternatively, I can design <code>register_user</code> to accept the side-effect function as a dependency, making it easier to swap it out during testing:</p> <p>```</p> <h1>app.py</h1> <p>def send_email(user): pass</p> <p>def register_user(user, send_email_func=send_email): send_email_func(user) return True ```</p> <p>To test it:</p> <p>```</p> <h1>test_app.py</h1> <p>def test_register_user(): calls = []</p> <pre><code>def fake_send_email(user): calls.append(user) result = register_user(&quot;Alice&quot;, send_email_func=fake_send_email) assert calls == [&quot;Alice&quot;] assert result is True </code></pre> <p>```</p> <p>Now, coming to Go.</p> <p>Imagine I have a function that calls another function which produces side effects. Similar situation. In Go, one way is to simply call the function directly:</p> <p>``` // app.go package app</p> <p>func SendEmail(user string) { // Sends a real email }</p> <p>func RegisterUser(user string) bool { SendEmail(user) return true }</p> <p>```</p> <p>But for testing, I can‚Äôt ‚Äúpatch‚Äù like Python. So the idea is either:</p> <h3>(1) Use an interface</h3> <p>``` // app.go package app</p> <p>type EmailSender interface { SendEmail(user string) }</p> <p>type RealEmailSender struct{}</p> <p>func (r RealEmailSender) SendEmail(user string) { // Sends a real email }</p> <p>func RegisterUser(user string, sender EmailSender) bool { sender.SendEmail(user) return true }</p> <p>```</p> <p>To test:</p> <p>``` // app_test.go package app</p> <p>type FakeEmailSender struct { Calls []string }</p> <p>func (f *FakeEmailSender) SendEmail(user string) { f.Calls = append(f.Calls, user) }</p> <p>func TestRegisterUser(t *testing.T) { sender := &amp;FakeEmailSender{} ok := RegisterUser(&quot;Alice&quot;, sender) if !ok { t.Fatal(&quot;expected true&quot;) } if len(sender.Calls) != 1 || sender.Calls[0] != &quot;Alice&quot; { t.Fatalf(&quot;unexpected calls: %v&quot;, sender.Calls) } }</p> <p>```</p> <p>(2) Alternatively, without interfaces, I could imagine passing a struct with the function implementation, but in Go, methods are tied to types. So unlike Python where I can just pass a different function, here it‚Äôs not so straightforward.</p> <p>‚∏ª</p> <p>And here‚Äôs my actual question: If I have a lot of functions that call other side-effect-producing functions, should I always create separate interfaces just to make them testable? Won‚Äôt that cause an explosion of tiny interfaces in the codebase? What‚Äôs a better design approach here? How do experienced Go developers manage this situation without going crazy creating interfaces for every little thing?</p> <p>Would love to hear thoughts or alternative patterns that you use.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So maybe this question just a has a boring answer, but I&#39;ve been learning a bit recently about statistics and specifically probability distributions, and it made me wonder if there&#39;s much thought put into exactly how to use randomness in games.</p> <p>So for example, probably the simplest probability distribution would be a uniform distribution, where each possible value has the same chance of happening, so like rolling a fair dice or flipping a coin.</p> <p>But there&#39;s other distributions, like the gaussian, binomial, Poisson, etc. which all have their own properties.</p> <p>It made me think of some simple examples, like say you have an RPG where the player gets some EXP after defeating an enemy, but you want there to be some variation in how much they get. I wondered which kind of distribution might be the most fun or rewarding; should it be a uniform distribution between some min and max value? Should it maybe be something like a truncated gaussian, so there&#39;s a higher chance of some middle value, but occasionally they&#39;ll get a really big reward, up to some max value? If it&#39;s gaussian, should it perhaps be skewed to keep the lower values more likely, but still a non-zero chance of a big payout?</p> <p>Same thing with something like a tycoon-style game, where you might have a varying amount of people coming into your establishment over time. Maybe all you do is generate a uniformly random value at the start of the day and that&#39;s the total number of visitors you&#39;ll get. But I think from my reading the more proper distribution would be to use a Poisson distribution, and sample that over some time period, perhaps once per in-game hour or even in-game minute.</p> <p>Maybe the answer to this question is as simple as &quot;each team just tries different things and goes with what works&quot;, I guess I&#39;m just curious if any devs have some interesting thoughts on randomness or possible some kind of further reading I could do, because I find the variety of applications interesting. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BattleAnus"> /u/BattleAnus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k9f6fq/has_there_been_much_research_into_the_use_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k9f6fq/has_there_been_much_research_into_the_use_of/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Drawing is pretty essential to game development from the early prototype phase to the full release. Be it for getting a feel about your game or showcasing it to other people. </p> <p>Unfortunately, my drawing skills have pretty much stayed the same as when I was 8 years old. I&#39;ve tried using assets, but I can&#39;t seem to find ones that fit my game idea. I&#39;ve told myself that I&#39;d eventually hire someone, but I want to finish my prototype first. For now, I&#39;ve decided to draw the sprites myself, and it takes me a huge amount of time for mediocre results.</p> <p>So I was wondering: how do you guys deal with being poor artists yourselves?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Whyisjono711taken"> /u/Whyisjono711taken </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k9asgv/how_do_you_deal_with_your_own_poor_drawing_skills/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k9asgv/how_do_you_deal_with_your_own_poor_drawing_skills/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To give some context, I&#39;ve been doing Tech Art for games for 5 years, 2 of those during education and 3 years professionally and got promoted to Mid-Level just before i&#39;ve been hit with another layoff.<br/> I&#39;ve been through 3 lay-offs and 2 cancelled projects that are highly under NDA, so my portfolio is still &quot;weak&quot; (aka junior level) because I can&#39;t show any recent work, and i&#39;m just tired of constant job searching and being thrown out of projects that i&#39;ve spent most of my days on before and got nothing to show for it.</p> <p>It&#39;s also incredibly hard for me to do high quality portfolio pieces since my specialisation is so support-based, I can only really write small tools for when I actually do a full solo project myself - but solo projects take large amounts of time and planning and energy as well so I&#39;m barely getting on with anything as I try to stay up to date with the tech AND do mediocre projects just to barely show what I can actually achieve for a team.</p> <p>I am confident in my skills but cannot properly show it, nor am I confident that I even get to keep the job when i finally get one again.<br/> So I&#39;m trying to figure out what other somewhat-aligned career paths I can pursue, where I can be more confident to invest time and energy into learning and building a portfolio for because I have higher hopes to actually keep the job for more than 2 years. Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences coming from there?<br/> I can do python tools, to software extensions, to pipeline setups and optimization, and I can do pretty much all common visual disciplines of 3D CGI such as creating models, rigging, texturing, writing shaders, VFX, Compositing/Post-Processing and I can handle and write Unity C# and Godot gscripts fairely well.</p> <p>And thanks for reading my desperate musings, I&#39;m in a limbo of not wanting to leave my passion career but I just want some stable work and finally get a grip of my life and be able to move out of my parents home.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/spacemilch"> /u/spacemilch </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k95ruk/tech_artist_and_trying_to_leave_the_industry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k95ruk/tech_artist_and_trying_to_leave_the_industry/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Earlier this year a friend and I decided to work on a small game prototype together. We have both been hobbyist gamedevs for a few years now, meaning that we each have worked on a bunch of smaller projects, game jam submissions, unfinished prototypes and even 1-2 free Steam games. But neither of us has made a real commercial indie game yet.</p> <p>Our expectations were just to have fun and try working together on a small-scale game. Because we were both working on larger solo projects, we agreed to set ourselves a clear deadline to make sure that we wouldn&#39;t distract ourselves for too long from our ‚Äúmain‚Äù gigs. Originally, we wanted to participate in a game jam, but since no jam at the time seemed to have an interesting theme and matched our schedules, we just decided to do our own ‚ÄúJanuary Jam‚Äù, which meant we had about 3 weeks to make a game.</p> <p>We are both fans of modern idle games like ‚ÄúNodebuster‚Äù, ‚ÄúGnorp Apologue‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo the Core‚Äù or ‚ÄúDigseum‚Äù. So, we decided to make an idle/automation game. Our concept was to have everything revolve around flipping coins. You start with a single small coin that you can flip by clicking it. When it lands on heads, you gain a little bit of money. You can then use that money to buy more coins, upgrades, bigger/better coins or little workers to automate the flipping and so one. Essentially, the classic ‚Äúmake number go up‚Äù loop.</p> <p>We worked a lot on the game in those 3 weeks. At time of deadline, the game was essentially finished, but we didn&#39;t want to release it right away. There were a few minor details that we wanted to polish and we wanted to give it to two or three friends to playtest it first. However, development slowed down extremely at that point, we both went back to our solo projects and only did a little bit of work on our coin flipping game here and there.</p> <p>After delaying the release for like 7 weeks we decided to finally press the button and just release it on itch. At that point, we just wanted to be done with the project and move on. We basically put zero effort into the launch. The capsule art was just a cheap collage of ingame sprites on a grey background, the itch page didn&#39;t have a description text, trailer or even any screenshots. We did nothing to promote the game in any form. It&#39;s not like we didn&#39;t like the game, but to us it was just a small side-project that ended up taking longer than we originally wanted.</p> <p>On our first day we had a bit over 100 people play the game, which honestly was already decent compared to some other uploads we had done on itch before. On the second day, we quadruplet the plays to over 400. On the third, we went to 1200. At that point we realized that we might have had underestimated our little side-project. To do at least some form of last-minute promotion we quickly wrote two reddit posts on <a href="/r/incrementalgames">r/incrementalgames</a> and <a href="/r/godot">r/godot</a> which both made pretty good numbers. That day we also made it pretty high on the New&amp;Popular tab on Itch. I think the highest was top 16, but I didn&#39;t track it properly. So, we might have been even higher. Some random player also added our game to a website called <a href="http://incrementaldb.com">incrementaldb.com</a>, which is like a community website for incremental game fans. That brought a ton of extra traffic to our itch page. On day four we made it to 3300 plays. Day five had 3600 and after that the daily plays finally started to go down.</p> <p>It&#39;s been little more than a month since the release and we are at about 29.000 plays now. We still get a few hundred players per day. But more importantly, we received over 200 very engaged comments and reviews over all channels. People were sharing ideas for new coins or interactions, demanding features and were proudly posting their endgame progress. The overall feedback in terms of quantity and quality has been better (and came much easier) than anything we had ever done before in the game-dev space.</p> <p>This all sounds like a great success. However, it was at the same time a big failure on our end. We completely failed to capture all the attention that we got. We didn&#39;t have a Steam page to wishlist or any other way of taking advantage of the traffic. The lack of effort on our promotional material also leaves to wonder whether the launch could have been even better if we had put in the effort to make some decent capsules, screenshots or a trailer.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Here are the lessons we took from this:</strong></p> <p>- You cannot trust your instincts when estimating the appeal/success of your project. We both liked the game, but we didn&#39;t recognize that we were onto something that would resonate so well with players. Nothing beats releasing a prototype to the public and getting honest player feedback.</p> <p>- Niche audiences and communities can bring a lot of attention. Most players came either from the itch idle genre page, <a href="/r/incrementalgames">r/incrementalgames</a> or incrementaldb. I&#39;m attaching some visibility stats from <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> at the end of the post.</p> <p>- Always put in at least a moderate amount of work into the presentation of your game - you never know how well its going to be received. I wouldn&#39;t say that you should always make a Steam page, because that involves a significant amount of work (and 100$), but if you already have a decent key art and some marketing material at hand, its also easier to set up a steam page within a few days - just in case you end up needing it.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How did we proceed afterwards?</strong></p> <p>After the great initial reception, it was clear to us that we wanted to continue working on the game and turn the prototype into a full release. It took us about two weeks to set up a steam page and get it approved by Valve. At that time, a lot of the interest in the prototype had already died down. We felt like we would need to provide something new to regain the attention of the players who had initially played the prototype. So, we decided to put more work into the game first and nail down the vision of the final product - so that we could clearly present on the Steam page what to expect from the full version and provide a new incentive to wishlist the game. We added a ton of requested features like statistics, automation, QoL features and accessibility settings. We expanded on the core game with things like new coins, upgrades and a talent tree. We also improved the art and hired an artist to work on a proper key art for us, as well as prepared a trailer for the Steam page. The prototype is still up, but we made some minor tweaks to it and added a wishlist button.</p> <p>The Steam page just released and we combined the launch with an update to the assets on itch and incrementaldb. We also wrote a couple of reddit posts in the relevant genre subs. We will see in the next days whether or not that was enough to recapture some of the initial interest. I&#39;ll definitely post an update here in case you are interested.</p> <p>I really hope you can take something away from this little write-up of our simultaneous success and failure.</p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/1L0MHl8">Screenshot of out Itch.io statistics</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBossforge"> /u/TheBossforge </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k92de0/our_prototype_blew_up_on_itch_and_we_were_not/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k92de0/our_prototype_blew_up_on_itch_and_we_were_not/">[comments]</a></span></div>
