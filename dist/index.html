            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>[edited]</strong></p> <p>I&#39;d like to implement a function that starts a standard <code>http.Server</code>. Because &quot;running&quot; a server is implemented using a blocking call to <code>http.Server.ListenAndServer</code>, a function that starts a server should make this call in a Go routine. So a function can look like:</p> <pre><code>func Start(s *http.Server) { slog.Debug(&quot;start server&quot;, slog.String(&quot;address&quot;, s.Addr)) go func(){ err := s.ListenAndServer() if err != nil &amp;&amp; !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) { s.logger.Error(&quot;error listening and serving&quot;, slog.String(&quot;error&quot;, err.Error())) } }() } </code></pre> <p>I want the function to return <code>error</code> only if it fails to start listening and serving. I do not want to wait longer than necessary for <code>ListenAndServer</code> to return with an error. I thought to implement it using channels with the new version looking like the following:</p> <pre><code>func Start(s *http.Server) error { slog.Debug(&quot;start server&quot;, slog.String(&quot;address&quot;, s.Addr)) ch := make(chan error) go func(){ err := s.ListenAndServer() if err != nil &amp;&amp; !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) { s.logger.Error(&quot;error listening and serving&quot;, slog.String(&quot;error&quot;, err.Error())) ch &lt;- err } }() select { case err := &lt;- ch: return err } return nil } </code></pre> <p>However, this will get blocked on <code>select</code> In responses people suggested to add a timeout to the select:</p> <pre><code>case time.After(10 * time.Millisecond) </code></pre> <p>So, the call to Start function will return an error If ListenAndServe discover an error during 100ms after the call. My guess is that for reasonably loaded system 100ms is enough to fail on listening or beginning to service requests.</p> <p>If there is a better or more robust method, please let me know. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/m1nherz"> /u/m1nherz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ke42pv/what_is_a_best_way_to_receive_a_quick_return/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ke42pv/what_is_a_best_way_to_receive_a_quick_return/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I just released <a href="https://github.com/chaindead/zerocfg">zerocfg</a>, the Go config library I believe to be <em>the most ergonomic</em> you can use. When I say ‚Äúmost ergonomic,‚Äù I mean it fixes long-standing pain points in the traditional Go config workflow. Let me walk you through the problems I encountered‚Äîand how zerocfg solves them.</p> <h1>The Problems with the Standard Go Config Approach</h1> <p>Most Go projects handle configuration roughly the same way‚Äîwhether you use <a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper">viper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/caarlos0/env">env</a>, <a href="https://github.com/heetch/confita">confita</a>, or another library:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Define a</strong> <code>struct</code> for your config.</li> <li><strong>Nest structs</strong> for hierarchical settings.</li> <li><strong>Tag fields</strong> with metadata (e.g. <code>yaml:&quot;token&quot;</code>, <code>env:&quot;TOKEN&quot;</code>, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Write a</strong> <code>Parse</code> <strong>function</strong> somewhere to set defaults, read files/env/flags, and validate.</li> </ol> <p>Sound familiar? Here‚Äôs what bugs me about that:</p> <h1>1. Boilerplate &amp; Three Sources of Truth</h1> <p>Every time you add a new option, you have to:</p> <ul> <li>Add a field in a struct‚Äîplus a tag (and sometimes even a new nested struct).</li> <li>In another place, declare its default value.</li> <li>In yet another place, pass that value into your application code.</li> </ul> <p>When logically related lines of code live far apart, it‚Äôs a recipe for mistakes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Typos in tags</strong> can silently break behavior, especially if defaults cover up the mistake.</li> <li><strong>Renamed keys</strong> that aren‚Äôt updated everywhere will blow up in production.</li> <li><strong>Extra work to add an option</strong> discourages developers‚Äîso many options go unexposed or hardcoded.</li> </ul> <h1>2. Configuration Sprawl</h1> <p>Over time, your config grows unmaintained:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Unused options</strong> that nobody pruned.</li> <li><strong>Missing defaults</strong> that nobody set.</li> </ul> <p>Both should be caught <em>automatically</em> by a great config library.</p> <h1>Inspiration: The Simplicity of flag</h1> <p>The standard <code>flag</code> package in Go gets it right for CLI flags:</p> <pre><code>var dbHost = flag.String(&quot;db_host&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;database host&quot;) func main() { flag.Parse() fmt.Println(*dbHost) } </code></pre> <ul> <li><strong>One line per option</strong>: key, default value, and description all in one place.</li> <li><strong>One</strong> <code>flag.Parse()</code> call in <code>main</code>.</li> <li><strong>Zero boilerplate</strong> beyond that.</li> </ul> <p>Why can‚Äôt we have that level of simplicity for YAML, ENV, and CLI configs? It turns out no existing library nails it‚Äîso I built zerocfg.</p> <h1>Introducing zerocfg ‚Äî Config Without the Overhead</h1> <p>Zerocfg brings the <code>flag</code> package philosophy to YAML, ENV, and CLI sources, with extra sugar and flexibility.</p> <h1>Quickstart Example</h1> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; zfg &quot;github.com/chaindead/zerocfg&quot; &quot;github.com/chaindead/zerocfg/env&quot; &quot;github.com/chaindead/zerocfg/yaml&quot; ) var ( path = zfg.Str(&quot;config.path&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;path to config file&quot;, zfg.Alias(&quot;c&quot;)) host = zfg.Str(&quot;db.host&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;database host&quot;) ) func main() { if err := zfg.Parse( // environment variables env.New(), // YAML file (path comes from env or CLI) yaml.New(path), ); err != nil { panic(err) } fmt.Println(&quot;Current configuration:\n&quot;, zfg.Show()) // CMD: go run ./... -c config.yml // OUTPUT: // Current configuration: // db.host = localhost (database host) } </code></pre> <h1>What You Get Out of the Box</h1> <p><strong>Single Source of Truth</strong> Each option lives on <em>one</em> line: name, default, description, and any modifiers.</p> <p><code>var retries = zfg.Int(&quot;http.retries&quot;, 3, &quot;number of HTTP retries&quot;)</code></p> <p><strong>Pluggable &amp; Prioritized Sources</strong> Combine any number of sources, in order of priority:</p> <p>CLI flags are always included by default at highest priority.</p> <p><code>zfg.Parse(yaml.New(highPriority), yaml.New(lowPriority))</code></p> <p><strong>Early Detection of Unknown Keys</strong> <code>zfg.Parse</code> will error on unrecognized options:</p> <pre><code>err := zfg.Parse( env.New(), yaml.New(path), ) if u, ok := zfg.IsUnknown(err); !ok { panic(err) } else { // u is map &lt;source_name&gt; to slice of unknown keys fmt.Println(u) } </code></pre> <p><strong>Self-Documenting Config</strong></p> <ul> <li>Every option has a description string.</li> <li>Call <code>zfg.Show()</code> to print a formatted config with descriptions.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Option Modifiers</strong> Mark options as required, secret, give aliases, and more:</p> <p><code>password := zfg.Str(&quot;db.password&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;database password&quot;, zfg.Secret(), zfg.Required())</code></p> <p><strong>Easy Extensibility</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Custom sources</strong>: implement a simple interface to load from anything (e.g., Consul, Vault).</li> <li><strong>Custom option types</strong>: define your own <code>zfg.Value</code> to parse special values.</li> </ul> <h1>Why Bother?</h1> <p>I know plenty of us are happy with <a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper">viper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/caarlos0/env">env</a>‚Äîbut every project I‚Äôve touched suffered from boilerplate, sneaky typos, and config debt. <a href="https://github.com/chaindead/zerocfg">Zerocfg</a> is my attempt to bring clarity and simplicity back to configuration.</p> <p><strong>Give it a try</strong>, critique it, suggest features, or even contribute!

That said, I work with gRPC services in a highly distributed system that&#39;s abstracted to the teeth (common practice in huge companies).</p> <p>We use Datadog for everything and have the pocket to not think about anything else. So my observability game is a little behind.</p> <hr/> <p>I was wondering, if you were to bootstrap a simple gRPC/HTTP service that could be part of a fleet of services, how would you add observability so it could scale across all of them? I know people usually use Prometheus for metrics and stream data to Grafana dashboards. But I&#39;m looking for a more complete stack I can play around with to get familiar with how the community does this in general.</p> <ul> <li>How do you collect metrics, logs, and traces? </li> <li>How do you monitor errors? Still Sentry? Or is there any OSS thing you like for that?</li> <li>How do you do alerting when things start to fail or metrics start violating some threshold? As the number of service instances grows, how do you keep the alerts coherent and not overwhelming?</li> <li>What about DB operations? Do you use anything to record the rich queries? Kind of like the way Honeycomb does, with what?</li> <li>Can you correlate events from logs and trace them back to metrics and traces? How?</li> <li>Do you use wide-structured <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/canonical-log-lines">canonical logs</a>? How do you approach that? Do you use <code>slog</code>, <code>zap</code>, <code>zerolog</code>, or something else? Why?</li> <li>How do you query logs and actually find things when shit hit the fan?</li> </ul> <p><em>P.S.

If there&#39;s anything missing from my implementation that you think you&#39;d find useful, let me know and I&#39;ll think about adding it!</p> <p>Everything&#39;s fully documented with plenty of examples and test cases, so if anything&#39;s left unclear, let me know and I&#39;d love to remedy it immediately.</p> <p>Thank you and I hope you enjoy my crate! üíú</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DynaBeast"> /u/DynaBeast </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdzo8c/i_just_made_a_new_crate_threadpools_im_very_proud/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdzo8c/i_just_made_a_new_crate_threadpools_im_very_proud/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, I am an embedded C/C++ developer having used a GCC / OpenOCD / Cortex-Debug / VSCode-based workflow for the last couple of years mostly on STM32 targets.</p> <p>Recently I have started to get into embedded Rust and I am mostly very impressed. I have one issue however: The debugging experience on embedded seems quite bad to me and I am wondering if I am missing something, or if this is just the way it is.</p> <p>My main problem: From C/C++ projects I am used to a debugging workflow where, if something goes wrong, I will set a breakpoint and step through the code, inspecting variables etc. I find this much more efficient than relying solely on log messages. Of course this requires toning down compiler optimizations somewhat, but I found that on GCC <code>Og</code> optimization gives me a reasonable tradeoff between binary size, speed and debugging experience.</p> <p>On Rust, even on <code>opt-level=1</code>, this approach seems almost impossible. For most code lines, you can&#39;t set a breakpoint, stepping is very unpredictable and most variables appear as &#39;optimized out&#39;, just as it would be on higher optimization levels on GCC.</p> <p>On <code>opt-level=0</code>, debugging seems to work fine; but unfortunately this does not help all too much, as <code>opt-level=0</code> results in HUGE binaries, probably much more so than unoptimized GCC. For example, on a project I was tinkering with I get these binary sizes:</p> <p><code>opt-level=0</code>: 140kB<br/> <code>opt-level=1</code>: 20kB<br/> <code>opt-level=s</code>: 11kB</p> <p>In any case, as I only have 128kB of Flash available on that particular microcontroller, I physically can not debug with <code>opt-level=0.</code> There does not seem to be an equivalent to GCC&#39;s <code>Og</code> which allows for some optimization while maintaining debuggability.</p> <p>It also does not seem possible to disable optimization on a per-function level, so this is also no way out.</p> <p>How do embedded Rust developers deal with this? Do you just not debug using breakpoints and stepping? Or is there a way to deal with this?</p> <p>In case it is relevant: I use probe-rs + VSCode. I also tried OpenOCD, which did seem to fare a bit better with <code>opt-level=1</code> binaries, but not enough to be a viable option.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonarwe"> /u/Jonarwe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdx0rl/is_it_possible_to_improve_the_debugging/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdx0rl/is_it_possible_to_improve_the_debugging/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been interested in learning assembly, but I really didn&#39;t like working with the syntax and opaque abbreviations. I decided that the only reasonable solution was to write my own which worked the way I wanted to it to - and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for the past couple weeks. I legitimately believe that beginners to programming could easily learn assembly if it were more accessible.</p> <p>Here is the link to the project: <a href="https://github.com/abgros/awsm">https://github.com/abgros/awsm</a>. Currently, it only supports Linux but if there&#39;s enough demand I will try to add Windows support too.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the Hello World program:</p> <pre><code>static msg = &quot;Hello, World!\n&quot; @syscall(eax = 1, edi = 1, rsi = msg, edx = @len(msg)) @syscall(eax = 60, edi ^= edi) </code></pre> <p>Going through it line by line: - We create a string that&#39;s stored in the binary - Use the <code>write</code> syscall (1) to print it to stdout - Use the <code>exit</code> syscall (60) to terminate the program with exit code 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)</p> <p>The entire assembled program is only 167 bytes long!</p> <p>Currently, a pretty decent subset of x86-64 is supported. Here&#39;s a more sophisticated function that multiplies a number using atomic operations (thread-safely):</p> <pre><code>// rdi: pointer to u64, rsi: multiplier function atomic_multiply_u64() { { rax = *rdi rcx = rax rcx *= rsi @try_replace(*rdi, rcx, rax) atomically break if /zero pause continue } return } </code></pre> <p>Here&#39;s how it works: - <code>//</code> starts a comment, just like in C-like languages - define the function - this doesn&#39;t emit any instructions but rather creats a &quot;label&quot; you can call from other parts of the program - <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> create a &quot;block&quot;, which doesn&#39;t do anything on its own but lets you use <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> - the first three lines in the block access rdi and speculatively calculate rdi * rax. - we want to write our answer back to rdi only if it hasn&#39;t been modified by another thread, so use <code>try_replace</code> (traditionally known as <code>cmpxchg</code>) which will write rcx to *rdi <em>only</em> if rax == *rdi. To be thread-safe, we have to use the <code>atomically</code> keyword. - if the write is successful, the zero flag gets set, so immediately break from the loop. - otherwise, pause and then try again - finally, return from the function</p> <p>Here&#39;s how that looks after being assembled and disassembled:</p> <pre><code>0x1000: mov rax, qword ptr [rdi] 0x1003: mov rcx, rax 0x1006: imul rcx, rsi 0x100a: lock cmpxchg qword ptr [rdi], rcx 0x100f: je 0x1019 0x1015: pause 0x1017: jmp 0x1000 0x1019: ret </code></pre> <p>The project is still in an early stage and I welcome all contributions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abgros"> /u/abgros </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdv1w1/im_creating_an_assembler_to_make_writing_x8664/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kdv1w1/im_creating_an_assembler_to_make_writing_x8664/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is the recommendation I got from <code>wild</code>s readme. This is a huge improvement, I wonder if there are any downsides to this?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say you have a type, and you have some code that serializes/deserializes this type to a JSON file (or any type of storage).</p> <pre><code>use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}; use std::{fs::File, path::Path}; #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] struct FooBar { foo: usize, } impl FooBar { fn new() -&gt; Self { Self { foo: 0 } } } fn main() { let path = Path::new(&quot;tmp/transform.json&quot;); // Read data from a JSON file, or create a new object // if either of these happens: // - File does not exist. // - Deserialization fails. let mut value = if path.exists() { let json_file = File::open(path).unwrap(); serde_json::from_reader(json_file).ok() } else { None } .unwrap_or(FooBar::new()); // Do logic with object, potentially modifying it. value.foo += 1; // value.bar -= 1; // Save the object back to file. Create a file if it // does not exist. let json_file = File::create(path).unwrap(); if let Err(error) = serde_json::to_writer_pretty(json_file, &amp;value) { eprintln!(&quot;Unable to serialize: {error}&quot;); } } </code></pre> <p>You keep running this program, and it works. But years later you realize that you need to modify the data type:</p> <pre><code>struct FooBar { foo: usize, bar: isize, // Just added this! } </code></pre> <p>Now the problem is, old data that we saved would not deserialize, because now the type does not match. Of course you could use <a href="https://serde.rs/attr-default.html"><code>#[serde(default)]</code></a> for the new field, but that works only when a <em>new</em> field is introduced. This could be problematic when a transformation is necessary to convert old data to new format.</p> <p>For example, let&#39;s say in your old type definition, you foolishly saved the year as a <code>usize</code> (e.g., <code>value.year = 2025</code>). But now you have deleted the <code>year</code> member from the struct, and introduced a <code>timestamp: usize</code> which must be a Unix timestamp (another foolish choice of a datatype, but bear with me on this).</p> <p>What you ideally want is to read the old data to a type that&#39;s similar to old format, and then transform the <code>year</code>s to <code>timestamp</code>s.</p> <p>Is there any library that can do something like this?</p> <h1>Edit:</h1> <p>If this is a real problem that everyone has, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a solution to it. However, what I have in mind is ideally something like this:</p> <p>When the data gets serialized, a schema version is saved alongside it. E.g.:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;schema_version&quot;: 1, &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;foo&quot;: 2, &quot;year&quot;: 2025 } } { &quot;schema_version&quot;: 2, &quot;data&quot;: { &quot;foo&quot;: 2, &quot;bar&quot;: -1, &quot;timestamp&quot;: 1735669800 } } </code></pre> <p>And there is some way to transform the data:</p> <pre><code>// Let&#39;s imagine that versioned versions of Serialize/Deserialize // derives versioned data types under the hood. E.g.: // // #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] // struct FooBar_V1 { ... } // // #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)] // struct FooBar_V2 { ... } #[derive(VersionedSerialize, VersionedDeserialize)] struct FooBar { #[schema(version=1)] foo: usize, #[schema(version=1, obsolete_on_version=2)] year: usize, #[schema( version=2, transform( from_version=1, transformer=transform_v1_year_to_v2_timestamp ) )] bar: isize, } fn transform_v1_year_to_v2_timestamp(year: usize) -&gt; usize { // transformation logic } </code></pre> <p>This is of course very complicated and might not be the way to handle versioned data transformations.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent the past 100-ish days working on a roguelike deckbuilder which I released on Steam. It&#39;s been almost a week since release and I want to bring up the many issues I experienced with Godot that has never been a problem beforehand and how my launch has gone.</p> <p><strong>For context, I&#39;ve been learning gamedev for about 5 and a half years now, originally starting with Unity, then switched to Godot after the fee drama happened.</strong></p> <p>So my game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3499540/COMBOLITE/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3499540/COMBOLITE/">Combolite</a> released with about 1400 wishlists and sold about 160 copies in 5 days, which is what I was expecting when going in with such low numbers. Just to clarify early on, I&#39;m not blaming the game engine for it&#39;s success/dissapointment, since that&#39;s 100% up to the product I make, and the marketing surrounding it, something that I could definitely have done better.</p> <p>Now, I have no problem with my first release not being successful, I made this game purely to gain experience on Steam, to earn more gamedev skills, and to figure out local taxes for the future.</p> <p>What I DO have a problem with is the refund rate, and why the majority of refunds are happening.</p> <p><strong>My game has a really high 11% refund rate, out of which 75% are CRASHES AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES.</strong> </p> <p>One of the players experiencing such issues (thankfully) joined my discord server, and as it turns out, the forward+ renderer (vulkan) was completely bugged on modern AMD graphics cards (rx 6000, 7000 etc.).</p> <p>In fact, it was so bad, that my game&#39;s colors were completely inverted???</p> <p>I had no access to an AMD GPU, so I had to try figuring out what was happening with that guy on discord who had no gamedev experience.<br/> My solution was to downgrade the project back to the OpenGL 3 compatibility renderer, and that was only possible since I wasn&#39;t using many of the unique features to Forward+...</p> <p>This however, still didn&#39;t fix the performance issues, though it was definitely better on lower end devices now <em>(for some reason? my shitty laptop with a 12th gen intel igpu went from 15fps to about 50fps)</em>, but higher end devices ran slower now, since Vulkan is just a more modern and better scaling API.<br/> I also tried DirectX 12 since the Forward+ renderer has support for that as well, and it did actually solve the graphical issues Vulkan had, but it had insanely long loading times, leading to more crashes than ever before.</p> <p><strong>The real issue comes from the stutters caused by SHADER COMPILATION, something pretty much all Godot games have to suffer with.</strong><br/> I&#39;ve tried literally EVERY solution to fix or even mitigate it, but not even Godot 4.4&#39;s ubershaders could help completely eliminating it. The current game has attempts to precompile stuff with a loading screen at the start of the game, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work as well as it should.</p> <p>The fact that I have to go so out of my way just to eliminate stutters that aren&#39;t even caused by bad coding on my part is just something I don&#39;t want to deal with anymore. Now this was a pretty low-stakes project, 3 months of work isn&#39;t too bad, <strong>but what would happen if this was a 6 month, a 9 month or a full year long project?</strong> </p> <p>What would happen if I realized near the end of the project, that my players would be running a russian roulette with a 1/10 chance to not be able to play the game properly? This is something I don&#39;t want to risk for my next project, which is one of the main reasons I will be leaving Godot for a while.</p> <p><strong>Does this mean Godot is a bad engine? Absolutely NOT.</strong><br/> I think for game jams and prototypes it&#39;s 100% a capable engine. I would also say that the 2D side of Godot is really good, and I would definitely consider using it for a commercial release, since only the 3D part seems to be so unstable. But for large or complex 3D projects with a decent amount of visual variety, I would definitely not recommend it.<br/> A large part of the gamedev community seems to have this same opinion, but the majority of them has not had the experience with what it&#39;s really is like to push the engine to its limits (which is what I&#39;ve done here).</p> <p>A personal issue that I have with Godot is that stencils have still not been added to the engine, despite them being technically supported for a while now. They are just not exposed to the users for seemingly no reason. The github issue surrounding this shows that it&#39;s ready to be merged to the main branch, but it&#39;s most likely being delayed until 4.5, which is already too late for my next project. Stencils are such an important feature for stylized rendering, and I&#39;ve been missing them ever since I stopped using Unity.<br/> And yes, you can technically emulate stencils by creating sub-viewports (render texture equivalent in Unity) but that&#39;s a really inefficient workaround that&#39;s very annoying to set up and scale.</p> <p><strong>So what engine am I going to use now?</strong><br/> As I said, I&#39;ve used <strong>Unity</strong> for the majority of my gamedev experience, so I will be moving back to it again. The fee drama has since been reverted and they even increased the treshold for the free version (not that I would reach it anytime soon lol). </p> <p>My main issue with Unity (the game engine) in the past was that it was just very clunky and slow, but according to my friends who still use Unity, the newest Unity 6 versions fixed the slowness and stability issues that the engine had for multiple years.</p> <p>I have way more trust in Unity&#39;s 3D capabilities than Godot&#39;s since Unity has been doing 3D for the past ~20 years. They have support for the latest graphics tech and should be miles more stable than what Godot is currently.</p> <p>I also looked into their UI toolkit (something I hadn&#39;t used before), and the webdev-like approach to UI really resonates with me since I study webdev in school anyway. It&#39;s something I wanted to recreate in Godot as well, but it just sounds like a huge project trying to figure out how to do that in an optimized way.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have an issue with C# either since I&#39;m forced to use Java in school, and the two languages are not that far away from eachother.</p> <p>Browser builds are also better on Unity, since they now support WebGPU, which Godot doesn&#39;t, and this would allow me to do a lot more shader magic during game jams.</p> <p><strong>The only downside to Unity is that code based shaders are a pain in the ass to write.</strong> They focus mainly on improving Shader Graph, which is a feature I really liked, but I much prefer Godot&#39;s shader code now.</p> <p><strong>Why not Unreal Engine?</strong><br/> I don&#39;t need the visual fidelity of UE5 and the lack of browser builds (pixel streaming doesn&#39;t count) is a deal breaker for someone who does a bunch of game jams for fun (like me). I also don&#39;t like visual coding or C++, so it just doesn&#39;t make any sense to even consider it, and it&#39;s even bigger and bulkier than older Unity versions.</p> <p>So yeah, that was the clusterfuck of a launch my first Steam release had. In the first 4 days I updated the game 9 times, switched renderers, attempted to optimize the game multiple times and tried fixing stutters. </p> <p>And yes, this game was playtested with a small group of people with different hardware and OS configurations. It just turns out that nobody had an AMD graphics card...</p> <p>Also, I&#39;m not looking for help with this post for figuring out the issues of my game. This is just a postmortem I wanted to write so we can all maybe learn something from it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kristoff_Red"> /u/Kristoff_Red </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdozd9/my_first_steam_release_after_55_years_of_gamedev/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdozd9/my_first_steam_release_after_55_years_of_gamedev/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ideas are definitely cheap. That&#39;s because everyone comes up with ideas, and most ideas have at least some merit. The real value comes from the execution. I think most reasonable people will agree with this.</p> <p>Most ideas can turn into great or bad games depending on the execution.</p> <p>But sometimes you have an idea for a game and you can envision the game in your mind and you <em>know</em> that that game would be awesome to play. And you are right about that, but that is because, of course, what&#39;s in your mind is the idealistically perfect execution of your idea. That being said, no game <em>ever</em> is perfectly executed. Even the most polished AAA games need to take shortcuts, compromise, hack things together sometimes. And you will never have the resources to make a game half as polished and well-executed as you imagine it.</p> <p>So, <strong>why do I say that you shouldn&#39;t be disillusioned by this?</strong></p> <p>Because that idea is still very powerful <em>to you</em>. An idea can motivate you to learn the ins and outs of game development. An idea can help you push through the hard parts of making a game.</p> <p>Take that idea and make the best out of it. The idea will begin taking form. It will deviate, change. But as long as it still inspires you to make your game, it is still valuable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArcaneThoughts"> /u/ArcaneThoughts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdkvqf/if_you_are_excited_by_a_game_idea_dont_let_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdkvqf/if_you_are_excited_by_a_game_idea_dont_let_the/">[comments]</a></span></div>
