Clearly, you have to have a unique idea, in my case, I didn&#39;t copy this game idea from anyone. Prototyped it with my kids for 7 years, started developing in VR 3 years ago. Overall, it will probably be a failure from a financial perspective, but I&#39;m still proud of it. </p> <p>My point of this post, don&#39;t bother paying for advertising unless it&#39;s highly targeted. Just putting your game in front of random people that are not interested in that sort of thing is just a waste of time and money. </p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523690/King_Crab/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523690/King_Crab/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot_Masterpiece_3668"> /u/Hot_Masterpiece_3668 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qvacn7/i_have_229k_youtube_subscribers_but_having_a_hard/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qvacn7/i_have_229k_youtube_subscribers_but_having_a_hard/">[comments]</a></span></div>

While my current job pays the bills and allows me to save some money, I don&#39;t think it will be enough to cover those expenses.</p> <p>I love programming, I&#39;m not particularly good or talented at it, but I find most of the web development tech stack and related fields uninteresting. Videogames are the only field I have felt motivated to study up until this point.</p> <p>This begs the question of whether it would be a better investment for my future to try to keep up with technologies I care very little about for possibly the rest of my life, or try to change into an industry that is notoriously much harder and competitive, in the hope that being something I actually care about, I will be able to achieve better results in it.</p> <p>I do not have any professional experience in the field, nor connections, but I have a few simple unity projects including a couple of game jams where I have worked remotely with designers and artists. </p> <p>I know a lot of the questions I have would have to be answered with &quot;it depends&quot;, but leaving the realm of personal values aside, these are the most practical ones i could come up with: </p> <p>- how long would it realistically take me to be in a position where i can get a decently paying and/or remote job in the industry?<br/> - should I aim for AAA or Indie studios? (i suppose the former are better paying while the latter offer more remote opportunities)<br/> - Is it worth aiming for a relevant master&#39;s degree and an intership, or should I just work on a portfolio and then start applying to positions?<br/> - Is my age a limiting factor for the job search?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cursed_beluga"> /u/cursed_beluga </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qv7ims/rambling_about_career_choices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qv7ims/rambling_about_career_choices/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>Happy to answer ANY question related with steam!</em> </p> <p>Releasing your game? Here is things you should double check.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Your game Build</strong><br/> Uploaded and set to default branch. Set your launch settings and publish. Log out of your steam account and log back in (clears cache) to see if it&#39;s the correct version is live.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Pricing</strong><br/> Double check your pricing and discount amount and duration. Discounts can be between 10%-40% and i recommend doing 14 days discount duration.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Store page</strong><br/> Update &quot;Wishlist now&quot; -&gt; &quot;Live now&quot; and make sure everything is up to date. Check the languages support, cloud save support, achievements, your descriptions, screenshots &amp; trailer.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Launch post</strong><br/> Prepare launch post on the steam backend. Title should say &quot;Game is now released!&quot; make sure it&#39;s a clear release post. Have 2-3 lines of text, release trailer link(optional), Widget to buy the game. (Look at steam docs on how to make a widget)</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Approved for release + release button</strong><br/> Make sure you passed steam review for storepage &amp; build. This unlocks the release button. Once you click it, you need to confirm by typing release my app, then you click an other button. This will load for a bit or nearly instant, and your app is now released.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Steam Discussions</strong><br/> Make sure people feel heard in discussions so people report bugs here. Otherwise they will flood your reviews instead. Typically it&#39;s good practice to pin a post with social links &amp; one for bugs. Make sure you pay close attention to discussions and don&#39;t be afraid to reply. Do avoid drama or confronting people, you just need to be HELPFUL.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Reviews</strong><br/> Best way to get more reviews, is to simply highlight existing reviews with your community. Making your community feel seen will encourage them to drop more reviews.</p> <p><strong>-&gt; Patching</strong><br/> Crazy breakable bug? The solution is NOT to fix it. During launch you need to be on top of your community and make them feel heard. Take your time with the fix, rushing hotfixes typically only leads to new issues. Please never panic patch, the solution to a terrible bug is community management. Remember, players are used to DAYS of waiting for AAA games, a couple more hours is worth waiting. Test your patches well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZeroPercentStrategy"> /u/ZeroPercentStrategy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qv17b2/steam_cheat_sheet_release_checklist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qv17b2/steam_cheat_sheet_release_checklist/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to share my experience selling pixel art asset packs on itch Io, partly as a reflection and partly in case it helps anyone else on a similar path as there doesnt seem to be many write ups like this.</p> <p>I started out as a <strong>hobby game dev</strong>, dabbled in Game Maker, and ultimatly settled in Godot. i made a few very small free games. Over time it became clear that passion was in the art, I enjoyed learning programming, but laying sprites on the page and is where I had the most fun.<br/> When I was experimenting with ideas or building small games, I would often buy asset packs if my own style didn’t fit or if I was short on time.</p> <p>In January 2025 I decided to produce my own asset pack, that i would sell on Itch, that i hoped would make a little bit of money, that could remain in my Itch io account, for me to then buy other peoples assets with.</p> <p>So i decided on a Platformer asset pack, as i thought it would be easiest to do, and i chose a realy limited but cool midnight looking colour pallet, to give it a unique vibe, and thats when I released <a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/moonlit-dungeon-dark-fantasy-pixel-platformer-tileset">Moonlit Dungeon</a> and an an accompanying UI pack to the market.<br/> I put them up and then basically left them alone.</p> <p>Throughout 2025, they made about $80. With very minimal marketing and barley any updates.</p> <p>I figured this wasnt to bad, and so about three months ago, I came back with more focus and decided to give it a real shot. i figured if one asset pack (excluding the UI) could do $80, then several, over the year, would be some nice passive income. </p> <p>So I built and released <a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/moonlitforest">Moonlit Forest</a> and a playable character pack. the feedback i had on these from the little bit of marketing I did was genuinley amazing and I sold a few bundle packs. It has maybe made an additional $30 -$40 since I released Moonlit Forest. </p> <p>One thing that was clear is that after the initial release, the packs would fade pretty quickly into obscurity. This is probibly something we can all releate to as developers, so I did some research and noticed people really seem to like cute, top-down, simple assets.</p> <p>So I got to work on my next pack, and 55 days ago, I released <a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/pocket-dungeon">Pocket Dungeon</a>, followed by:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/pocket-forest">Pocket Forest</a></li> <li><a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/pocket-village">Pocket Village</a></li> <li><a href="https://sebbyspoons.itch.io/pocket-cemetery">Pocket Cemetery</a></li> </ul> <p>One thing I experimented with early on was offering both a free version and a paid version of some packs.<br/> I assumed that the free version would act as a funnel, people could try it, like it, and then upgrade but in practice that didn’t really seem to happen.</p> <p>The free versions got downloaded, but conversion to paid was very low. I have since moved away from that approach and so far, i think its better for sales, but time will tell.</p> <p>As i mentioned before, every release gets a strong initial boost in views, downloads, or gets added to a personal collection, and then there’s a sharp visible drop-off in the analytics over the following few days. After that, the page feels almost invisible unless you actively drive traffic to it.</p> <p>Despite that, each pack has 5-star ratings, which is awesome, since I think that this is what boosts visibility in the algorithm, but ratings are so hard to get.</p> <p>I’ve also had a several super nice comments.</p> <p>In total, across everything, I’ve made just over $230</p> <p>knowing this is niche, optional content, I can say that I am quite proud, but i do hope to gain more momentum as I release more packs in the future. (Another Moonlit pack next, then I think Pocket Farm)</p> <p>The post-launch drop-off is demotivating. I’m not a great marketer, and long-term discovery on itch feels tough. but I will keep at it and see what happens.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure anyone who’s shipped a game or asset pack knows that feeling of the launch spik and then the quiet afterwards. How do you stay motivated or keep up the visibility?</p> <p>I hope this post was interesting/helpful for some.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qurepe/ive_been_working_on_different_game_engines_for_6/" target="_blank">I've been working on different game engines for 6 years. here's my take</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve started making games in 2018 with Unity as that was the most used engine at the time. But my curiosity got me to try new engines. Throughout my gamedev journey I&#39;ve used the 3 engines; Godot, Unreal, Unity.</p> <p>Unity: Unity is a very general purpose engine. You could use it to make games or for making web apps with 3d interactions. It&#39;s a very open ended engine where it lets you implement the stuff you want but sometimes that becomes a downside aswell. In a project for a client We were using HDRP, one of Unity&#39;s render pipelines, to make the project and we had come across an issue; for some reason in Unity 2020 (or 2019 don&#39;t really remember) they had gotten rid of painting grass on terrain for some unknown reason. And we&#39;ve found some workarounds like using the tree painting method for painting grass but that wasn&#39;t intuitive and we decided to buy a terrain asset instead of using Unity terrain or its components. That was the same for IK system in Unity we also bought a plugin for that but if you&#39;re just gonna buy plugins for everything, that doesn&#39;t make it that easy to use this engine does it ? But in all honesty Unity is a great engine because it simply gets stuff working. But it&#39;d be an even more amazing engine if they could stop getting things half done. One upside to it is that it&#39;s really fast to iterate using Unity.</p> <p>Godot: Godot is kinda controversial. Godot has no &#39;right&#39; way to do things because it hasn&#39;t been widely adopted by the industry. lots of people use different approaches to everything. One thing missing for godot is a paid asset store. Yes godot is an open source and free engine which is cool and all but I don&#39;t think everyone wants to put their things as free. Some might want to sell these assets or plugins but godot has a free asset library. it&#39;s open source and if you end up making a plugin for it there is no market to sell it to. There are 3rd party asset stores that you can sell stuff at but that&#39;s not the same as having an asset store for the engine with customer support. That being said I think godot is a beautiful engine. Some people think godot looks terrible or it looks like a kid&#39;s game engine but if you know how yo use / make ORM materials and some mid lighting you can get it looking fine. Also there&#39;s no Terrain solution for 3d in Godot but that is solved by one of the plugins I forgot the name for. And it does have some bugs and issues with the editor but that happens to all of the engines. One of the downsides is no job market for godot so if you&#39;re looking for that then I&#39;d not recommend godot for now.</p> <p>Unreal: Unreal is one of those software that feels like it&#39;s made for one purpose only and it&#39;s really equipped for that. Unreal provides a more professional workflow and it expects you to learn that. unlike other engines like godot or Unity, you don&#39;t get to place everything everywhere you want. you want a static instance of something ? you don&#39;t get to create that you need to use GameInstance or GameState based on your needs. When you use Unreal for the first time this workflow looks like something you can&#39;t understand or is really hard to get used to but once you do it&#39;s very rewarding. Asset store for unreal (now called FAB) has amazing assets that you can use to create great games but that&#39;s also kinda misleading for some people. Most people open up unreal to make a game thinking &quot;it&#39;s the best looking engine out there&quot; and make a game with that terrible &quot;unreal engine look&quot; No unreal is not like that. If you really want good results you need to work on Lighting and materials. You just don&#39;t get to make a AAA looking game with no effort. Unreal also has most of the tools you need in the engine where you probably don&#39;t need any plugins. Just use what unreal has and publish a game. I think if you&#39;re only making 3d games Unreal engine is a go to. now Unreal also has big downsides the UI and how cluttered it is. For the life of me I find it really hard to navigate through. Unreal is objectively slower to iterate in than Unity or Godot for most workflows. It does have a good workflow but it&#39;s slow. Engine is really heavy, consumes your pc&#39;s resources. and if you want to do something deeper that blueprints can&#39;t do you need to use C++. it does have garbage collection but only cover UObjects so you need to handle memory and dangling pointers.</p> <p>If I had to choose one engine to use forever as a Solo developer it&#39;d be Unity because it has tools for both 3d and 2d. Even tho Unity does lack many features or has the features as half implemented it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t make a game with it. You just need to find the workaround it&#39;s not the best for everything but it&#39;s enough for everything</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/QuietTR55"> /u/QuietTR55 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qurepe/ive_been_working_on_different_game_engines_for_6/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qurepe/ive_been_working_on_different_game_engines_for_6/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about this lately but I feel like the newer generation needs more hand-holding in games?

What do you guys think or am I just totally off the roads here?</p> <p>I think games shouldn&#39;t be just babysitting the player, what&#39;s the fun in that? I do understand that people are different but then again, a game is not for everyone. I remember that most of the games I&#39;ve played, I spend the time exploring and learning the game.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a fun experiment, I wanted to create a stack-based futures collector which uses little or no heap memory. Think of <code>FuturesUnordered</code> from the futures-core crate, except that the futures can be stack allocated as if by <code>pin!</code>, and the number of concurrent futures is capped at a constant amount.</p> <p>My efforts evolved into this crate, which turns out to perform very well! Better than other crates in this space. So that&#39;s great. I adapted <a href="https://github.com/zetanumbers/futures-concurrency-benchmark">this benchmark</a> from notgull and zetanumbers in addition to creating my own benchmarks.</p> <p>I am now releasing it as <strong><em>slotpoller</em></strong>. By design, slotpoller is bounded; it uses a fixed number of slots to store the futures. The user can add more futures onto the poller when space is available.</p> <p>Some cool facts:</p> <ul> <li>The slots are invisible to the user, which is a neat API trick that some people may find useful.</li> <li>The compiler de-duplicates monomorphized code if the generic parameter doesn&#39;t affect the actual function. The library leverages this by relying on &amp;mut [T] instead of [T; N], so the N constant is turned into a runtime value.</li> </ul> <p>.</p> <p>Enjoy.
