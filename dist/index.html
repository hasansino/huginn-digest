Even with AI becoming more common, it still feels like we‚Äôre living in an API-driven world. What&#39;s so hard or fun about software engineering these days? Sure, algorithms play a role, but more often than not, it‚Äôs about idempotency, timeouts, transactions, retries, observability and gracefully handling partial failures.</p> <p>So what‚Äôs the big deal with system design now? Is it really just those things? Sorry if this sounds a bit rant-y ‚Äî I‚Äôm feeling a mix of frustration and boredom with this topic lately.</p> <p>How do you write your handlers these days? Is event-driven architecture really our endgame for handling complex logic?</p> <p>Personally, I always start simple ‚Äî but simplicity never lasts. I try to add just enough complexity to handle the failure modes that actually matter. I stay paranoid about what could go wrong, and methodical about how to prevent it.</p> <p>P.S.: Sorry I published the same content in the Go channel, and I want to publish here too, I know Rust devs think different, and these two channels are the only ones I trust most.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to avoid an intermediate allocation in between downloading a file, and decoding the file data. The decoder is generic for any Read. The problem is that the data might be gzip compressed.</p> <p>Here is my previous solution:<br/> <code>rust pub(crate) fn maybe_gzip_decode(data:bytes::Bytes)-&gt;std::io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;{ match data.get(0..2){ Some(b&quot;\x1f\x8b&quot;)=&gt;{ use std::io::Read; let mut buf=Vec::new(); flate2::read::GzDecoder::new(std::io::Cursor::new(data)).read_to_end(&amp;mut buf)?; Ok(buf) }, _=&gt;Ok(data.to_vec()), } } </code></p> <p>The Vec&lt;u8&gt; is then wrapped in std::io::Cursor and fed to the file decoder. My idea is to pass the decoder in a closure that is generic over Read.</p> <p>To be used something like this: ```rust fn decode_file&lt;R:Read&gt;(read:R)-&gt;MyFile{ // decoder implementation }</p> <p>...</p> <p>let maybe_gzip:MaybeGzippedBytes=download_file(); let final_decoded=maybe_gzip.read_with(|read|decode_file(read)); ```</p> <p>A problem I forsaw is that it would expect the read type to be the same for every callsite in read_with, so I wrote the function to accept two distinct closures with the plan to pass the same closure to both arguments. Here is my prototype:</p> <p><code>rust pub struct MaybeGzippedBytes{ bytes:bytes::Bytes, } impl MaybeGzippedBytes{ pub fn read_maybe_gzip_with&lt;R1,R2,F1,F2,T&gt;(&amp;self,f1:F1,f2:F2)-&gt;T where R1:std::io::Read, F1:Fn(R1)-&gt;T, R2:std::io::Read, F2:Fn(R2)-&gt;T, { match self.bytes.get(0..2){ Some(b&quot;\x1f\x8b&quot;)=&gt;f1(flate2::read::GzDecoder::new(std::io::Cursor::new(&amp;self.bytes))), _=&gt;f2(std::io::Cursor::new(&amp;self.bytes)) } } } </code></p> <p>The rust compiler hates this, stating &quot;expected type parameter <code>R1</code> found struct <code>flate2::read::GzDecoder&lt;std::io::Cursor&lt;&amp;bytes::Bytes&gt;&gt;</code>&quot; and similar for R2.</p> <p>Do I completely misunderstand trait bounds or is there some sort of limitation I don&#39;t know about when using them with Fn? Why doesn&#39;t this work? I know I could successsfully write the conditional gzip logic outside the library, but that would be irritating to duplicate the logic everywhere I use the library.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/krakow10"> /u/krakow10 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jw9v6m/trait_bounds_confusion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jw9v6m/trait_bounds_confusion/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Even with AI becoming more common, it still feels like we‚Äôre living in an API-driven world. What&#39;s so hard or fun about software engineering these days? Sure, algorithms play a role, but more often than not, it‚Äôs about idempotency, timeout, transactions, retries, observability and gracefully handling partial failures.</p> <p>So what‚Äôs the big deal with system design now? Is it really just those things? Sorry if this sounds a bit rant-y ‚Äî I‚Äôm feeling a mix of frustration and boredom with this topic lately.</p> <p>How do you write your handlers these days? Is event-driven architecture really our endgame for handling complex logic?</p> <p>Personally, I always start simple ‚Äî but simplicity never lasts. I try to add just enough complexity to handle the failure modes that actually matter.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Today we have the release of the indie Metroidvania game on consoles. The release was supported by Sony&#39;s official YouTube channel, which is, of course, very pleasant. But as soon as it was published, the same ‚ÄúThis is AI generated!‚Äù comments started pouring in under the video.</p> <p>As a developer in a small indie studio, I was ready for different reactions. But it&#39;s still strange that the only thing the public focused on was the cover art. Almost all the comments boiled down to one thing: ‚ÄúAI art.‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI Generated thumbnail‚Äù, ‚ÄúSad part is this game looks decent but the a.i thumbnail ruins it‚Äù.</p> <p>You can read it all here: <a href="https://youtu.be/dfN5FxIs39w">https://youtu.be/dfN5FxIs39w</a></p> <p>Actually the cover was drawn by my friend and professional artist Olga Kochetkova. She has been working in the industry for many years and has a portfolio on ArtStation. But apparently because of the chosen colors and composition, almost all commentators thought that it was done not by a human, but by a machine.</p> <p>We decided not to be silent and quickly made a video with intermediate stages and .psd file with all layers:</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/QZFZOYTxJEk">https://youtu.be/QZFZOYTxJEk</a> </p> <p>The reaction was different: some of them supported us in the end, some of them still continued with their arguments ‚ÄúAI was used in the process‚Äù or ‚Äúyou are still hiding something‚Äù. And now, apparently, we will have to record the whole process of art creation from the beginning to the end in order to somehow protect ourselves in the future.</p> <p>Why is there such a hunt for AI in the first place? I think we&#39;re in a new period, because if we had posted art a couple years ago nobody would have said a word. AI is developing very fast, artists are afraid that their work is no longer needed, and players are afraid that they are being cheated by a beautiful wrapper made in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>The question arises: does the way an illustration is made matter, or is it the result that counts? And where is the line drawn as to what is considered ‚Äúreal‚Äù? Right now, the people who work with their hands and spend years learning to draw are the ones who are being crushed.</p> <p>AI learns from people&#39;s work. And even if we draw ‚Äúnot like the AI‚Äù, it will still learn to repeat. Soon it will be able to mimic any style. And then how do you even prove you&#39;re real?</p> <p>We make games, we want them to be beautiful, interesting, to be noticed. And instead we spend our energy trying to prove we&#39;re human. It&#39;s all a bit absurd.</p> <p>I&#39;m not against AI. It&#39;s a tool. But I&#39;d like to find some kind of balance. So that those who don&#39;t use it don&#39;t suffer from the attacks of those who see traces of AI everywhere.</p> <p>It&#39;s interesting to hear what you think about that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lana__ro"> /u/lana__ro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jwbe09/its_definitely_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jwbe09/its_definitely_ai/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are a few things in game dev that seems okay to delay or not important‚Ä¶until you&#39;re deep in development and realize that adding them &quot;now&quot; is an absolute nightmare!! I wanted to share four things (and one optional one) to think about when starting your new project! This is based on my experience using <strong>Unity</strong> and app development, but it should be applicable to most engines.</p> <p>Now, something to keep in mind (specially for new devs): You should not worry about this in your prototype / testing ideas phase. That phase should be focused on testing ideas fast! This is something that you do in pre-production / production.</p> <h1>1. Localization</h1> <p>Even if you&#39;re only using one language for now, make your strings localization-ready. Choose your approach early: Unity Localization package, I2, a custom CSV/Google Sheets-based solution</p> <p>Why it matters:</p> <ul> <li>Hunting down hardcoded strings later is tedious and can be complicated</li> <li>UI spacing issues (some languages are way longer)</li> <li>You might end up with duplicated variables, broken references, missing translations</li> </ul> <p>‚úÖ <strong>Tip</strong>: Use your main language for now, but store all UI strings through your localization system from the start. Unity Localization (and other systems might too) have something called Pseudo Localization. It test whether strings are localized and also checks the UI responsiveness for longer words.</p> <h1>2. Saving</h1> <p>Decide if, how, and what you&#39;re saving. This will shape how you organize your save data (dictionaries, objects, strings, etc). Options are pre-made assets (i.e.: ES3) or custom systems.</p> <p>Why it matters:</p> <ul> <li>You‚Äôll need to think about what data to save and when. Different approaches are autosaves, manual saves, checkpoints, session data, etc.</li> <li>Retrofitting save logic later means very painfully refactoring core systems!</li> </ul> <p>‚úÖ <strong>Tip</strong>: Treat saving like a game design/UX mechanic. When should progress save? How often? How recoverable should it be?</p> <h1>3. UI Responsiveness</h1> <p>Your game will be played on different screens‚Äîdon‚Äôt just test one single resolution. This is specially true if you are using the (older) Unity UI system (I have not used UI Toolkit). So from the beginning:</p> <ul> <li>Pick a target resolution</li> <li>Add common aspect ratios/resolutions to the Game view (even wide and ultra-wide!)</li> <li>Set up rect transform anchors properly</li> <li>Use layout groups when you need (wider screens will increase the size and spacing quite a bit. Smaller spaces will shorten the available spaces).</li> <li>Keep testing the UI across the different aspect ratios/resolutions that you added as soon as you add it</li> </ul> <p>Why it matters:</p> <ul> <li>Retrofitting anchors and layouts can be very time-consuming and its easy to miss screens. This is specially true with localization</li> <li>You might have to redo entire UI screens</li> </ul> <p>‚úÖ <strong>Tip</strong>: Pixel art, HD 2D, and vector-based UIs all behave differently when scaled.</p> <h1>4. Controller Support</h1> <p>Unless you&#39;re developing exclusively for mobile, it&#39;s <em>very</em> likely you&#39;ll need to support both <strong>keyboard &amp; mouse</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>gamepad</strong>. Choose your input system like Unity Input System (new or legacy), Rewired, or other third-party tools.</p> <p>Why it matters:</p> <ul> <li>Input impacts UI layout, navigation flow, button prompts, and overall UX</li> <li>Adding controller support late often means full UI rewrites or clunky workarounds that makes one of the inputs pretty lackluster</li> </ul> <p>‚úÖ <strong>Tip</strong>: Design your UI from the start with both input types in mind‚Äîeven if you prototype with just one. You can always also suggest one as the preferred one.</p> <h1>5. Analytics (Optional)</h1> <p>Data will be very useful to inform decisions when you have a beta, demo, and even when the game is released. You can act based on data and qualitative research. Things to do:</p> <ul> <li>Choose a platform (Unity Analytics, Firebase, GameAnalytics, etc.)</li> <li>Check event limitations (cardinality, max params, rate limits) and API format. This will decide how to organize your data and what can you gather.</li> <li>Define <em>what</em> questions you want answered that can help you take decisions.</li> <li>Use a wrapper so you can switch platforms if needed</li> </ul> <p>Why it matters:</p> <ul> <li>Retrofitting analytics can be as messy as the saving retrofitting (okay, maybe not as bad, but lots of parsing around the code).</li> <li>You miss out on useful insights if you add it late</li> </ul> <p>‚úÖ <strong>Tip</strong>: Remember that this is aggregated data, so think of it as what data from 1000 users would give me valuable information (instead of what did this one player did).</p> <p>Hope this helps someone avoid the mistakes I‚Äôve made in the past üòÖ</p> <p>edit: I had blanked out about Controller support. Very important! Thanks <a href="/u/artoonu">u/artoonu</a> for the reminder.</p> <p>edit #2: Added a note highlighting that you should not worry about this in the prototyping phase.
