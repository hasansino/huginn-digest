This makes the code much simpler - we don&#39;t have to juggle 3D tensors in our heads. And besides, batch dimension is not inherent to Transformers architecture.</p> <p>I was able to get this kind of generation on my MacBook Air:</p> <pre><code>Mysterious Island. Well.

This seems like it should be really simple, but I&#39;m losing my mind here.</p> <p>For example, I would expect the following code to do the trick:</p> <pre><code>use serde_json::json; use tracing::{event, Level}; fn main() { // Set up the subscriber with JSON output tracing_subscriber::fmt().json().init(); // Create a serde_json::Value payload. Could be any json serializable struct. let payload = json!({ &quot;user&quot;: &quot;alice&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;login&quot;, &quot;success&quot;: true }); // Emit an event with the JSON payload as a field event!(Level::INFO, payload = %payload, &quot;User event&quot;); } </code></pre> <p>However, I get:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2025-04-24T22:35:29.445249Z&quot;, &quot;level&quot;: &quot;INFO&quot;, &quot;fields&quot;: { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;User event&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;{\&quot;action\&quot;:\&quot;login\&quot;,\&quot;success\&quot;:true,\&quot;user\&quot;:\&quot;alice\&quot;}&quot; }, &quot;target&quot;: &quot;tracing_json_example&quot; } </code></pre> <p>Instead of:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2025-04-24T22:35:29.445249Z&quot;, &quot;level&quot;: &quot;INFO&quot;, &quot;fields&quot;: { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;User event&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;: { &quot;action&quot;: &quot;login&quot;, &quot;success&quot;: true, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;alice&quot; } }, &quot;target&quot;: &quot;tracing_json_example&quot; } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yxaepnm"> /u/yxaepnm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k75jvc/how_can_i_emit_a_tracing_event_with_an_unescaped/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k75jvc/how_can_i_emit_a_tracing_event_with_an_unescaped/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey fellow Rustaceans and distributed systems enthusiasts!</p> <p>Super excited to share a recent improvement in Duva, the Rust-powered distributed key-value store: I&#39;ve implemented <strong>gossip-based reconnection logic!</strong></p> <p>Dealing with node disconnections and getting them back into the cluster smoothly is a classic distributed systems challenge. Traditional methods can be slow or brittle, leading to temporary inconsistencies or nodes being out of sync.</p> <p>By baking in a gossip protocol for handling reconnections, Duva nodes now constantly and efficiently share lightweight information about who&#39;s alive and part of the cluster.</p> <p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Faster Healing:</strong> Nodes rejoin the cluster much quicker after an outage.</li> <li><strong>More Resilient:</strong> No central point of failure for knowing the cluster state. Gossip spreads the word!</li> <li><strong>Always Fresh View:</strong> Nodes have a more accurate, up-to-date picture of the active cluster members.</li> </ul> <p>This builds on Duva&#39;s existing gossip-based failure detection and RAFT consensus, making it even more solid.</p> <p>If you&#39;re into Rust, distributed systems, or just appreciate robust infrastructure, check out Duva! This reconnection work is a key piece in making it more production-ready.</p> <p><strong>Find Duva on GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Migorithm/duva">https://github.com/Migorithm/duva</a></p> <p>A star on the repo goes a long way and helps boost visibility for the project! ‚ú®</p> <p>Happy to chat about the implementation details in the comments!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/letmegomigo"> /u/letmegomigo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k6yrrf/made_duvas_cluster_reconnections_way_more_robust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k6yrrf/made_duvas_cluster_reconnections_way_more_robust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k70c30/applied_statistical_methods_to_our_analytics_data/" target="_blank">Applied statistical methods to our analytics data for the first time the other day. Results were amazing!</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>TLDR: Our six-man indie studio is experimenting with combining analytics with statistical methods for the first time, and after solving some problems, the results are a gold mine.</em></p> <p>I‚Äôm the design lead for NIMRODS, a horde shooter/bullet heaven/survivor-like/whatever you want to call the genre. We were gun-shy about trying to incorporate advanced analytics into our game to monitor game balance because we&#39;re a tiny studio, but when we tried it, it was <em>absolutely</em> worth it. I thought I&#39;d share our experience in case anybody else is on the fence about spending this sort of time and effort.</p> <p>Our Game&#39;s USP is that we have an elaborate weapon-building system: Your weapon‚Äôs got seven slots. Each slot had 4-5 different unique augments that can go in that slot, each of which ‚Äútiers‚Äù up independently from the ones in other slots, and each of which has a branching path partway through its progression. If you picture each tier of these augments as being as complex as your average uncommon Magic the Gathering card you won‚Äôt be far off: each time you tier up an augment has the possibility to drastically change the nature of your gun, and finding ‚Äúcombos‚Äù between different parts as you draft them is part of the fun.</p> <p>Trying to balance all of these against each other is a nightmare given that we‚Äôre up to 125 billion possible combinations of augments (if you count each tier of each augment as distinct from each other, as we do internally.) Manual testing‚Äôs not going to cut it. Beta tests worked well for a while, but after we released our EA, beta testers became scarce for new patches as the hype died down. Using the Unity ML-Agents package to train an AI to play and balance-test our game would have been a huge sink of time and computing resources. In the end, I decided to just make a formula that would estimate how much each augment (and each tier of augment) would perform in a best case and average case situation, defining performance as ‚ÄúThe amount the player‚Äôs DPS would be hypothetically multiplied by if they chose it.‚Äù Then, to balance an augment, I could frob the input numbers until I got an output DPS that matched the power level we were aiming for for that augment.</p> <p>The formula got complicated. Some inputs were easy. The Cryo Magazine multiplies a player‚Äôs Bullet Damage by √ó1.4. So when a player takes it, their DPS will go up by about 1.4. I say ‚Äúabout‚Äù because any damage in excess of a monster‚Äôs HP is lost, so extremely high damage builds won‚Äôt deal as much DPS when shooting weaker monsters. But what‚Äôs the extent of the ‚Äúlost‚Äù DPS? There was really no way to tell besides costly testing, which we ended up not doing due to time and budget constraints.</p> <p>When your easiest stat is already requiring you to use guesswork, that‚Äôs not a good sign, but we kept going. Sometimes we‚Äôd do short tests to try and find especially important constants, especially when things looked like they were going wrong. (For instance, AoE effects ended up affecting about 1.4 enemies times the AoE‚Äôs radius squared on average. This was half as many as I‚Äôd guessed it would, and the new info prompted a <em>huge</em> buff to the ‚ÄúExploding Bullets‚Äù augment.) Often, various augments would require their own bespoke formulas to estimate their DPS. (A gun stock that causes you to deal extra damage based on your HP, for instance, required us to calculate the player‚Äôs likely HP at that point in the game and plug it in to the formula.) Eventually, we had an absolutely massive, poorly maintained spreadsheet riddled with tribal knowledge. Completely unsustainable.</p> <p>Things reached a breaking point in a recent update when we added a new kind of ammo that reduced your reload speed in favor of increasing your bullet penetrations (ie, your bullet would go through the first target it hit and hit more behind it.) Naively, you&#39;d think that doubling a player‚Äôs penetrations would double their DPS, but that‚Äôs only the case when more enemies are lined up behind the first enemy, which isn‚Äôt always true, even with skilled players picking their shots carefully.</p> <p>Previously, I&#39;d been estimating the DPS of augments assuming what I call an &quot;arbitrarily target-rich environment,&quot; meaning the player is constantly surrounded by infinitely thick enemies. Why? Because we just didn&#39;t have any good data to show what we should use as an &quot;average case&quot; scenario for the player, and near the end of the game when the player was a ball of death and enemies came in from every side, this ‚Äútarget-rich environment‚Äù assumption was more or less true. But this piercing ammo could be taken as early as 15 seconds into the game, when there were rarely enough enemies to line up like that. Thus, reports came back from beta testing that the Piercing Ammo felt incredibly weak and not fun to play with because the Penetrations weren&#39;t compensating for the Reload Speed drawback. This frustrated me because I could see it was true, but I had no way to model it. The numbers on the augment would have worked for an arbitrarily target-rich environment, but with fewer monsters, the DPS dropped through the floor. Eventually I threw my formulas to the side and just arbitrarily cut the reload penalty to less than half of what it was initially. It felt bad to depart from my DPS calculations and just <em>guess</em> what the right answer was, But we lacked the data for a more sophisticated answer.</p> <p>In other words, we were past due for analytics.</p> <p>My first thought was to add analytics to keep track of how many enemies, on average, a player was hitting with any given number of penetrations, but the more I thought about that approach, the more I realized what a rabbit hole that was. Maybe we could have gotten that data, but there were literally dozens of other stats, some of which were unique to particular augments, that we‚Äôd need similar data for, and it was unreasonably costly to ask for analytics for every single such case.</p> <p>In the shower (it always happens in the shower, lol) I realized we were coming at it from the wrong direction. Instead of using analytics to build ever-more-complicated models of player behavior to estimate the DPS of an augment, what if we used analytics to measure player DPS directly? It stood to reason that if we had enough samples of the DPS players were dealing with certain builds, then it should be possible to use statistical methods to separate out what each augment&#39;s contribution to the total damage was. Then we could just buff the ones that were underperforming and nerf the ones overperforming. Reaching back to my ancient college stats class, I thought that perhaps multiple linear least squares regression would give us the number we needed, but that setup assumes that your dependent variable is a linear combination of your input variables. Our game has a multiplicative damage system that results in exponentially increasing damage instead of a typical additive system with a linear damage curve, so it seemed like the method wouldn‚Äôt fit. In despair, I brought the problem to my old stats professor‚Äôs office, and he didn‚Äôt even let me finish the question before asking why I wasn‚Äôt log transforming it.</p> <p>And that was the answer. Once we had a plan, a programmer spent about a day adding analytics in a clever way; We needed to get about 50-70 samples per run (one for each permutation of the player‚Äôs build over the course of that run) and how much DPS they did with that combination. Obviously, we couldn‚Äôt spare 50+ unity events per run, so instead we concatenated all the data into a string that we sent in a single unity event at the end of the run, which we‚Äôd pull and decode on our end. Our decoder program put all the samples into a giant csv that we could run through the free trial of MatLab, which gives you 30 hours a month or so of compute time. The primary payload was a ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs Hot‚Äù (ie boolean) representation of whether or not the player was in possession of each possible augment. One wrench in our model was that there was some contributors to damage that were linear instead of exponential. (ie, our metagame upgrades, certain ‚Äúfiller‚Äù levels between tiering up augments, etc.) We eventually decided to handle those with a ones-hot representation that was rounded to the nearest ‚Äúbucket‚Äù. (ie, were you adding +10% to your rate of fire? Yes/no? How about +20%? Yes/no? How about 30%‚Ä¶)</p> <p>An internal test with a handful of runs gave dismally nonsensical results. Extending the test to around 30k samples (500ish runs) actually gave surprisingly good results, with an R-Squared value of 0.170. We got excited, and then ran it on 800k samples, and we got results that looked decent, but our R-Squared was down to 0.006, which wouldn‚Äôt fly. We were left scratching our heads, trying to figure out what we did wrong. ChatGPT was full of ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù advice, suggesting that we apply all sorts of complicated statistical methods I‚Äôd never heard of, or that perhaps our underlying data just couldn‚Äôt be represented with this model, but I designed this thing to be multiplicatively balanced, and it just made no sense that it wasn‚Äôt working correctly in a log-transformed multiple linear regression, so we looked a little closer, pulling out some of the top and bottom damage dealers to see if we could figure something out‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚Ä¶well, it turns out that the top damage dealer was dealing around 100 duodecillion damage per second. For context, our community considers a ‚Äúgood‚Äù damage per second near the end of the game to be a few million. Even more curiously, upon further inspection, this fine chap seemed to be doing this damage with nothing equipped but an unaugmented pistol.</p> <p>So our next step, obviously, was to try and identify and eliminate people who were using cheat engines to modify the game‚Äôs data or memory. We knew there were such people; sometimes after an update they‚Äôd come into our discord and ask if anybody knew of updated config files for popular cheat engines so they could get back to their shenanigans as quickly as possible. We picked a threshold that we considered ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù (x20,000 damage more than they should have been doing), removed any data points with a residual over the given amount, then re-ran the data, and Hallelujah, wouldn‚Äôt you know it, our R-Squared was up to 0.92!</p> <p>So on my end, I created a google sheet where you could copy the output of the regression directly from python (we‚Äôd given up on Matlab; the free version just wouldn‚Äôt let us crunch through our entire 1.8M samples we‚Äôd collected up to that point) and paste it into one given input cell, hit ‚Äúsplit text to columns,‚Äù and then switch to the ‚Äúoutput‚Äù tab, where it would give a nice report showing what the damage multipliers were for each of our augments and tiers of augments. We were so excited by the results we took a simplified version and sent it out to players to geek out over in our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2086430/announcements/detail/506200990068768785?snr=2___">most recent devlog</a>, and the reception has been really good. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xs9nTT2niOW5fEoJoxNN2vPV8K52B9PYrZUV7Usoit4">You can see the spreadsheet here.</a>)</p> <p>This data is a gold mine. It is so relieving to have solid data on the performance of our augments. We‚Äôre immediately planning a host of balance changes based on what we‚Äôve found, mostly centered around undoing the damage caused by our ‚ÄúArbitrarily Target-Rich Environment‚Äù assumption. But even though there are some really clear winners and losers, I was immensely pleased by how close a lot of the augments were to our target values. We‚Äôre still going to keep the formulas around, but only use them to estimate good numbers for our new augments we add during content updates. Then, we‚Äôll ask beta-testers to play them specifically, concatenate their samples onto the samples for the most recent patch (so we‚Äôve got a lot of data on what our current aug situation is like) and use that to determine how well our new augments are performing, and adjust them from there before releasing them to the public. This is going to be both far easier, far more sustainable, and far more more accurate than the way we were doing it before. This is a huge level up for our design, and I want to see if in our future titles, we can bake analytics in at the outset instead of seeing how far we can hobble without them.</p> <p>If anybody else from a small studio is nervous about spending the time and effort required to build out an analytics system for game balance and run statistical methods on the output, I&#39;d highly recommend it. In our experience:</p> <ul> <li>The right statistical methods can pull meaningful data out of even highly multivariate systems with many independent variables.</li> <li>You might not see sensical results immediately, but more samples and/or cleaner samples can make your output much more cohesive.</li> <li>Measuring outcomes and adjusting accordingly is easier to implement, easier to use, and more sustainable than trying to build models to predict the outcomes.</li> </ul> <p>So that&#39;s our takeaways.</p> <p>What&#39;s been your experience collecting analytics to assist with game balance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Talonos"> /u/Talonos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k70c30/applied_statistical_methods_to_our_analytics_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k70c30/applied_statistical_methods_to_our_analytics_data/">[comments]</a></span></div>
