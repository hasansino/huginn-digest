Do you only update fields that actually changed (how would I track it?), or is updating all fields acceptable in most cases? I‚Äôve read that updating only changed fields helps reduce concurrency conflicts, but I‚Äôm unsure if the complexity is worth it.</p></li> <li><p>For aggregates like Order that depend on others (e.g., Customer) which are versioned, is it common to query those dependencies by ID and version to ensure consistency? Do you usually embed something like {CustomerID, Version} inside the Order aggregate, or is there a more efficient way to handle this without incurring too many extra queries?</p></li> </ol> <p>I&#39;m using the repository pattern for persistence, + I like the idea of repositories having a very small interface.</p> <p>Thanks for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pristine-One8765"> /u/Pristine-One8765 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mmiqr8/how_do_you_handle_aggregate_persistence_cleanly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mmiqr8/how_do_you_handle_aggregate_persistence_cleanly/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not very intelligent, but every crate I&#39;m using has very good and easy-to-understand documentation, except <code>clap</code>. The documentation is confusing and not easy to understand at all. I&#39;ve been trying to get something up and running all day, but I&#39;m getting nowhere. It appears there are two different ways to work with <code>clap</code>: using the <code>Parser</code> through <code>#[derive(Parser)]</code> and using a command builder. I found the former to be much more intuitive, but research suggests it&#39;s rather limited in its abilities. For instance, I was trying to create a directory in the current working directory using <code>my-app new</code>. The <code>new</code> argument is not supposed to take a subcommand as an argument (e.g., a path). It appears as if the <code>Parser</code> implementation doesn&#39;t support standalone commands. The documentation didn&#39;t help, unfortunately. I had to purely rely on articles I found online because, again, the documentation is more confusing than it is helpful. At least the automatic help menu generation worked.</p> <p>Then came the command builder, and that is where I lost all hope. The documentation on the command builder feels like it&#39;s non-existent. It covers a lot of niche use cases but doesn&#39;t cover even the most basic stuff. For the love of God, I tried writing a simple &quot;Hello, &lt;Name&gt;!&quot; program for a solid two hours before giving up. I couldn&#39;t even get the automatic help menu to show up.</p> <p>I mean, <code>clap</code> <strong>has</strong> to work, right? So many people swear by it, and even cargo uses it, and it works great.</p> <p>Then again, I am the most brainless person you&#39;ll ever meet. All I&#39;m really looking for is a logical way to parse arguments easily. Situations like this make me want to be a senior Rust-Dev so I can just write my own parsing library that even a baby can use.</p> <p>I&#39;d appreciate it if some of you could point me in the right direction.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I understand that implicit type conversions can be a dangerous thing, but in cases when it&#39;s obviously safe, why can&#39;t rust just do it?</p> <p>Can I tell the compiler that my program will only run on 32 or 64 bit processors, so it can implicitly (and safely) convert my u32 into usize without me having to do &quot;as usize&quot; every damn time I want to index my Vec? Or am I doing something wrong?</p> <p>How do you guys manage this? Still a beginner in Rust, and I really like working with the language, but these type conversions driving me nuts.</p> <p>Example code:</p> <pre><code>// self.pixels is a Vec&lt;Color&gt; type // w is u32, h is u32, thus i is u32 too for i in 0..(w * h) { self.pixels[i as usize] = Color::white(); } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/g0atdude"> /u/g0atdude </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mmjw55/implicit_type_conversion_when_its_safe/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mmjw55/implicit_type_conversion_when_its_safe/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve reached a significant milestone with our Rust implementation of the App Store Server Library. The latest release brings us to full feature parity with Apple&#39;s official Swift, Python, Java, and Node.js libraries - all tests and functionality are implemented.</p> <p>Key highlights of this release:</p> <ul> <li>OCSP validation support - Certificate revocation checking is now available as an optional feature flag</li> <li>100% API coverage - Every endpoint, notification type, and validation mechanism from the latest App Store Server API is fully implemented</li> <li>Receipt verification utilities - Complete support for both modern StoreKit 2 transactions and legacy receipt validation</li> <li>Flexible TLS backend - rustls (default) or native-tls based on your deployment requirements</li> </ul> <p>The library has been tested in production environments. We&#39;ve focused on providing a clean, idiomatic Rust API while maintaining compatibility with Apple&#39;s exact specification requirements.</p> <p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/app-store-server-library">Apple App Store Server Rust Library on crates.io </a></p> <p>Feedback and contributions welcome. </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tikhop"> /u/tikhop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/namecare/app-store-server-library-rust">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mmiwjc/announcing_apple_app_store_server_rust_library/">[comments]</a></span></div>
