I have a background of Mobile development and currently I&#39;m having a hard time understanding a need for domain layer.</p> <p>In our codebases we have a handler for REST/Grpc(Presentation layer), Services/Managers(App layer) and infrastructure layer which has clients for other microservices, kafka, sqs clients etc.</p> <p>I don&#39;t understand where would domain layer fit? Everywhere I read domain layer is what contains the core logic but isn&#39;t that Application layer? What&#39;s the difference in business logic and core logic.</p> <p>For all I care, I can write all the logic in App layer which is dependent on infra layer for different clients. So when do we really use a domain layer? </p> <p>To make matters worse, one of our repository written by a senior dev has Presentation layer, Domain layer and infra layer. So it seems that App layer and domain layer names are being used interchangeably.</p> <p>Before I ask people in my org dumb questions I wish to know more.

Which Rust-specific habits do you always apply?</p> <p>Like so many others, I decided to write a Chess engine. And it&#39;s going SLOWLY.</p> <p>Background: I&#39;ve been programming since punch cards, and I&#39;ve been using Rust for about five years. My biggest Rust project so far was only a handful of files, so I&#39;m tackling something larger to learn the dragons of idiomatic Rust:<br/> Goals:<br/> 1. Big enough project to stress the architecture<br/> 2. 100% idiomatic, embracing traits, ownership, and zero-cost abstractions<br/> 3. No UI logic, UCI command line only.<br/> 4. Fun, because why else?</p> <p>Pain Point example: In the process of iterating on a bitboard engine, I:<br/> * Started with u64 masks and indices, swapped to enums for squares and colors<br/> * Wrapped masks in a type and generated code in <a href="http://build.rs">build.rs</a> to speed the build up.<br/> * Tried to write integration tests and unit tests<br/> * Then split everything into its own crate (working on that now)<br/> *** Lesson learned: defining crate boundaries early saves dozens of hours of refactoring.</p> <p>My Current Workflow:<br/> 1. Spike the feature without obsessing over structure<br/> 2. Prove it works with quick manual tests<br/> 3. Refactor: clean code, reorganize modules, remove dead code, if bug found, fix and loop back to Step 1<br/> 4. Write tests to isolate bugs, fix, then loop back to Step 1</p> <p>Questions for you:<br/> <strong>Which bad habits did you shed when switching to Rust, and which new ones did you adopt?</strong><br/> What&#39;s your end-to-end Rust workflow, from prototype to production crate?<br/> Which Rust-specific tools (Clippy, Rustfmt, cargo-audit) and patterns (error handling with thiserror, anyhow, or custom enums; leveraging try_from/try_into; module crate mapping) do you swear by?<br/> How and when do you decide to extract a new crate?<br/> What testing strategies (unit, integration, property testing) keep you confident?<br/> When do you add &#39;bench&#39; tests?</p> <p>I&#39;m eager to learn from your real-world workflows and build better Rust habits.

Here are the <a href="https://github.com/alexheretic/rust-string-bench?tab=readme-ov-file#results">results</a>.</p> <p>A surprise (to me) is that my results seem to suggest that small string inlining libraries don&#39;t provide much advantage over std heaptastic <code>String</code>. Indeed the other libraries only beat len=12 <code>String</code> at cloning (plus constructing from <code>&amp;&#39;static str</code>). I was expecting the inline libs to rule at this length. Any ideas why short <code>String</code> allocation seems so cheap?</p> <p>I&#39;m personally most interested in create, clone and read perf of small &amp; medium length strings.</p> <p><code>Utf8Bytes</code> (a stringy wrapper of <code>bytes::Bytes</code>) shows kinda solid performance here, not bad at anything and fixes <code>String</code>&#39;s 2 main issues (cloning &amp; &amp;&#39;static str support). This isn&#39;t even a proper general purpose lib aimed at this I just used <em>tungstenite</em>&#39;s one. This kinda suggests a nice <code>Bytes</code> wrapper could a great option for immutable strings. </p> <p>I&#39;d be interested to hear any expert thoughts on this and comments on improving the benches (or pointing me to already existing better benches :)).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alexheretic"> /u/alexheretic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ng54ht/benchmarking_rust_string_crates_are_small_string/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ng54ht/benchmarking_rust_string_crates_are_small_string/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! One more such post, sorry in advance..</p> <p>Before this post, I did couple prototypes in each engine... aaand I still stuck to choose. I will try to be as short as possible.</p> <p><strong>Shut up already, I won&#39;t read it:</strong> What made you switch Unreal to Godot, or from Godot to Unreal?</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I want to make First Person 3D games, as hobbyist solo dev at first. I know a bit of Blender and Substance Painter. My goal to achieve is games with style like CS:GO, Half Life (not fully realistic). Gameplay - some sort of simulation, interaction games, walking simulator, I don&#39;t know yet. As for me both engines have ups and downs. But I literally cannot choose, and I don&#39;t know how to choose. I value simplicity and lightweight of Godot, and powerful graphics of Unreal. I dislike dynamic typing in Godot, and C++ workflow of Unreal.</p> <p>Now longer list:</p> <p><strong>Godot:</strong></p> <p>Pros: * Node system, it is flexible, any node could be attached to any other node, which leaves you with open choice * Every resource is human-readable, makes bugfixing much easier * The fastest iterate cycle (even with C#) * It is just simple - for simple games with no advanced gameplay or visuals, I believe Godot is good enough * Editor UI, I think, it is very clean and straightforward. I love it.</p> <p>Cons: * GDScript - apologies to fans, but professionally, I&#39;m using Kotlin, which is strongly statically typed language with curly brackets. Complete opposite to GDScript (however syntax is very similar). I already found very weird cases with GDScript, even with static typing - for example, if you define property with only getter, you still can assign new value to this property. Nothing will happen, compiler doesn&#39;t scream, value won&#39;t be changed. That&#39;s why I think GDScript doesn&#39;t scale well. * C# support is second-citizen yet - let&#39;s look at console porting, using C# it will provide even more complexity to already complex work. Even though it isn&#39;t relevant to me right now, I want to be future-proof. Unity has IL2CPP, that&#39;s why you can tell C# is first-class citizen (well, it is only lang you can use in Unity xD). But Godot provides nothing today. * 3D support is still maturing. Yeah, it supports PBR textures (which I would like to use), but I just afraid to have put much models into Godot, I literally got feeling it will explode, I don&#39;t know why. * Less games -&gt; Less players -&gt; Less support from Nvidia, AMD, Intel etc. If you&#39;re interested in this topic, I did <a href="https://forum.godotengine.org/t/frame-time-increased-without-a-reason-inconsistently/120164/1">post on Godot Forum</a> * Stability of Editor - bugs, bugs, bugs. For example, sometimes material icon in the inspector just doesn&#39;t represent what it actually have. It is constant discomfort.</p> <p><strong>Unreal:</strong></p> <p>Pros: * I doubt I will ever reach limits of visual capabilities, put cube - it will look great :D * Overall game performance is just probably best(?). Put anything to it, it will just run it. I have no fear to work with it, unlike with Godot. * Asset workflow - awesome. Very configurable, no issues with it. Well, I got feeling this engine is build for designers at first place * Built-in tools for First Person games and not only, is just huge. Yes, it is very rigid, you need to &quot;obey&quot; the engine, but it provides thousands hours of work.</p> <p>Cons: * C++ - I already dropped engine couple times because how irritating it is to work with Unreal&#39;s C++: constant restarting of editor, if you make mistake in the code, editor will be crashed. I still try to get used to C++, but having headers and cpp divided into two files it&#39;s just hard to admit personally (again, coming from Kotlin/Java/C# etc). Also, it is fragile - any wrong rename/move of C++ file, BP could be broken. And that&#39;s with the fact I&#39;m using Rider. * Unreal is huge - starts slower, more disk space (it is irrelevant for me), probably, more demanding from hardware for the same game in comparison with Godot, more features included (even though, I will use probably 10% at max of it). * Documentation for C++ almost non-existent - yep, you have source code. Good luck reading all of it. I still cannot believe that such mainstream engine doesn&#39;t have proper documentation. * It is rigid, too rigid. You need to follow those damn guidelines that engine built for you. For example, I like usage of Timeline, but you cannot put it into your custom Static Mesh Component. I know it is wrong approach, you really rarely need to extend SMC, but that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say. You can spend hours of time if you go a little bit outside of what it is built for. * Too much of features, like really too much. I believe, Unreal could be built with just plain plugins (probably it is actually), out of the box you&#39;ve got already a lot setup for you. It isn&#39;t simple engine after all.</p> <p>I can&#39;t really tell that I comfortable with both of them. Probably, Godot is much better for newbies (as me), so it is much easier to tackle with. But also, not really, sometimes in Unreal it could be setting, when in Godot you need to build from scratch.</p> <p>What about Unity? With this one, I can tell, I just don&#39;t like it. Easy. With Godot and Unreal, I&#39;m stuck.</p> <p>Thank you if you read it to the end. I will be grateful for any advices.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_DefaultXYZ"> /u/_DefaultXYZ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ng97rv/unreal_vs_godot_for_3d_solo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ng97rv/unreal_vs_godot_for_3d_solo/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys,</p> <p>I just released the demo for my first indie game, <em>Dice Dice Baby</em> on steam. I chose to use the relatively new feature of steamworks which allows you to create your demo as a separate app id and have its own page. </p> <p>As I understood it back then, it was supposed to let players leave reviews on the demo, get me feedback, and avoid ruining the main game page in case the reviews were bad. These were the main pros I got from choosing this way of publishing the demo. It was a lot of additional work, I had to juggle between two app ids, make every change to the store of library pages twice, manage all versions...</p> <p>In reality there are a few issues with this system:</p> <p>- Very few players seem to realize you can review demos. I have had more people commenting the game via reddit, social networks, or even the game community page than people leaving reviews for the game. I think players are just used to not being able to do this, you still can&#39;t review half the demos that are released today, and nothing really indicates on which demos you can or cannot.</p> <p>- The steam flow for reviews is very unclear even if you know you can leave a review. Everything points back to the main game&#39;s page, which is a good thing of course, but the issue is that you have to go to the store page <em>of the demo</em> to even see that you can leave a review. In practice, you never have to go to this page to download the demo and play it. You have to manually search the name of the game, and select the &quot;demo&quot; entry that pops up in the search to reach this page.</p> <p>- Demo review visibility is null on the main page. Even if your demo has 99% positive review, it is only visible on the demo store page, once again. This means it doesn&#39;t matter how good your demo reviews are, it will have no impact on the download rate as noone will this them.</p> <p>- I can&#39;t help but feel my positive reviews are lost forever. For the few people that found and took the time to leave a positive review, I can&#39;t imagine them reviewing the game again at launch. Maybe I&#39;m mistaken and they will, but I can&#39;t help and feel I just lost precious positive reviews. </p> <p>After the fact, I&#39;m really starting to wonder if it was worth the extra work. I tried to find other games doing it but, as far as I searched, all games seem to chose to have their demo hosted on the main page.</p> <p>So I would love to hear your opinion on this. Has anyone found a big benefit to having a dedicated demo page I&#39;m not seeing ? Or is it just a bad idea to do it altogether ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NuggetGamesStudio"> /u/NuggetGamesStudio </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfuitc/whats_the_point_of_releasing_a_separate_demo_page/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfuitc/whats_the_point_of_releasing_a_separate_demo_page/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So many people suggest here that for your first game(s) the only goal should be to release. You shouldn‚Äôt have to think about creating a masterpiece, and you shouldn‚Äôt focus on marketing or how much it may sell.</p> <p>Like many people with no released game, I didn‚Äôt listen. I spent months making a large scoped 3D co-op networked multiplayer game and devastatingly burned out. Then I decided to lower my expectations to hell. I changed everything and started anew. This time the only thing I cared about, or tried to care about, was finishing it. It‚Äôs essentially a mobile game with 3D graphics. I liked the first few hours of &quot;<em>The Tower ‚Äì Idle Tower Defense&quot;</em> but not the endless idle mechanics, so I decided to make that first section the whole game. You start, buy upgrades, die, buy meta upgrades, play again and go further, after a few plays you beat the game. Very small and kind of a bad game. I love working on shaders and GPU-instanced grass (I‚Äôm proud of my <strong><em>grass</em></strong> though) so I kept them.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the kicker: I still can‚Äôt finish it. It‚Äôs been months since I bought the Steam page and released a no-gameplay demo. But after that, every minute I spend working feels like a waste because game won‚Äôt ever be played by design. I constantly drop my tasks to hunt for a miracle that will make the game ‚Äúsell.‚Äù I keep trying to add new features, mechanics, and game modes. I plan to change genres; add manual aiming, multiplayer, rogue-like items ‚Äî then I scrap them too because releasing was the goal and I shouldn‚Äôt add to the scope. It‚Äôs a constant loop with no productivity in between.</p> <p>I‚Äôm sure there are people like me here, or people who used to be in a similar condition. What do you suggest? I feel like the ‚Äúrelease first and do better on your next game‚Äù approach didn‚Äôt work for me at all yet I have no motivation to start for something bigger now.</p> <p>This is not a promotion or a hidden ad. There is no sell-able product, mostly a rant. I am adding the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710860/The_Wildwatch/">store link</a> to give context and maybe get feedback. But if you checked the game, what do you think may be a solution to make it not so bad of a game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth-Alarm6447"> /u/Worth-Alarm6447 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfr8hk/how_do_you_even_finish_a_game_that_wont_ever_sell/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfr8hk/how_do_you_even_finish_a_game_that_wont_ever_sell/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been experimenting with winit and wgpu just as a learning experience, and so far have a window that I am able to capture events for and am able to draw textures to the screen. I would like to keep going with it and had the idea of trying to create a Macroquad style framework crate.</p> <p>With Macroquad you init it when your main function starts and then have access to a handful of functions such as checking input with is_key_pressed(KeyCode::W), drawing shapes and textures with draw_rectangle(my_rect), and ending the frame with next_frame(). I&#39;m fairly sure I would know how to do this with once_cell, you would access to some global object and call methods on it to check the input state, send it shapes and textures you want drawn so it could queue them up, then have the engine flush it all when next_frame() is called, that&#39;s not really my issue.</p> <p>My question is with winit you get an event loop object that takes ApplicationHandler object and runs it for you, taking over control of the entire application. Because of this you don&#39;t seem to be able to do a traditional input&gt;update&gt;draw game main loop and only call into the engine when you need it. It also seems that older versions did have a event_loop.poll() method that would maybe let you do this but its deprecated and not recommended.</p> <p>I&#39;m just curious if there is another way to approach this problem. Ideally I would like to put all the &quot;engine&quot; code into its own crate so I could keep it separate from any game code and just call into it as needed, but the requirement to hand control to the winit event loop completely seems to prevent me from doing this.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done a fair amount of searching and haven&#39;t really found a way to do it so it does seem its not really possible, but I figured I would ask here just in case anyone more experienced is able to shed some light.</p> <p>Just for some reference this is the top level of what I have:</p> <pre><code>#[derive(Default)] struct App { state: Option&lt;state::State&gt;, } impl ApplicationHandler for App { fn resumed (&amp;mut self , event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop) { let window = event_loop.create_window(Window::default_attributes()).unwrap(); self .state = Some(state::State::new(window)); } fn window_event (&amp;mut self , event_loop: &amp;ActiveEventLoop, _window_id: winit::window::WindowId, event: winit::event::WindowEvent) { // Do I have to put my application code here? eg // self.game.update(delta); match event { WindowEvent::CloseRequested =&gt; { self .state. take (); event_loop.exit(); } WindowEvent::Resized(size) =&gt; self .state. as_mut ().unwrap(). resize (size), WindowEvent::RedrawRequested =&gt; self .state. as_mut ().unwrap(). render (), _ =&gt; (), } } } fn main() { let event_loop = EventLoop::new().unwrap(); event_loop.set_control_flow(ControlFlow::Poll); let mut app = App::default(); event_loop.run_app(&amp;mut app ).unwrap(); } </code></pre> <p>EDIT: I have just read about the EventLoopProxy and user events, where you can pass your own events into the event loop from other threads which may be the solution. I&#39;ll have to spend some time trying them out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fungihead"> /u/fungihead </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1nga80o/winit_event_loop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1nga80o/winit_event_loop/">[comments]</a></span></div>
