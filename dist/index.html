I&#39;ll help with direction, architecture, organization, but otherwise I won&#39;t be writing much code.</p> <p>The idea is that you pick a function that contains a <code>todo!()</code>, implement it (potentially delegating to other functions you create with a <code>todo!()</code> in the body) and send a PR with the new function. You can also contribute by creating issues, documentation, tests, writing about it here or telling your friends, anything goes!</p> <p>I also created a <a href="https://discord.gg/Dned3QwJe2">Discord server</a> for it.</p> <p>Let&#39;s have fun and see how far we can take this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nitnelave"> /u/nitnelave </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kcqur6/experiment_in_crowdsourcing_development_of_a_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kcqur6/experiment_in_crowdsourcing_development_of_a_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It turns out, it is!</p> <p>I have also come up with a way to compile the <code>keepass</code> crate to WebAssembly, so that I can additionally deploy the app to a web browser without any installation needed. See the <a href="https://omnikee.github.io/docs/architecture/overview/">architecture page in the docs</a> how that is done. Overall, deploying to that many platforms from one codebase is great and adding new features is not <em>too</em> difficult!</p> <p>The app is now working on 4 / 5 platforms that Tauri supports, with only iOS missing since I don&#39;t own an iPhone nor an Apple Developer account. </p> <p>The feature set is still pretty barebones, but the hard parts of decrypting databases, listing entries, etc. are all working, so I wanted to share the proof-of-concept to gather feedback and gauge interest in building this out further.</p> <p>If you are an Android user and you would like help me release OmniKee on Google Play, please PM me an E-mail address associated with your Google account and I can add you to the closed test.

(MIT Rust book) let mut s1: &amp;str = &quot;mutable string slice&quot;; println!(&quot;string slice s1 ={s1}&quot;); s1 = &quot;s1 value is updated here&quot;; println!(&quot;string slice after update s1 ={s1}&quot;); } </code></pre> <p>``` if you run this snippet say on Windows 11, x86 machine you can get an output similar to this</p> <p><code>console $ cargo run Compiling tut-005_strings_2 v0.1.0 (Examples\tut-005_strings_2) Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s Running `target\debug\tut-005_strings_2.exe` Hello there address of greeting 0xc39b52f410 s = hello address of s 0xc39b52f4c8 s after updating its value: Salut le monde! address of s 0xc39b52f4c8 string slice s1 =mutable string slice string slice after update s1 =s1 value is updated here </code> * Why does this code run without any compiler issue? * is the variable <code>s</code>, <code>s1</code> still consider a string literal in that example?</p> <ul> <li><p>if <code>s</code> is a literal, how come at run time, the value in the address binded to <code>s</code> stay the same?</p> <ul> <li> maybe the variable of type <code>&amp;str</code> is an immutable reference, is that&#39;s why the address stays the same?

This milestone has been a journey, and I sincerely appreciate your patience.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge that this release took longer than anticipated. Over the past year, I made significant revisions, ultimately reverting much of the work to refocus on a clearer, more sustainable direction. Although challenging, this process has provided invaluable insight into the project&#39;s path forward. Looking ahead, I plan to take a few months to refine project management strategies, streamline the issue backlog, and map out a thoughtful roadmap for future releases.</p> <h2>What&#39;s Included in v1.7.0?</h2> <p>While I didn‚Äôt accomplish everything I originally set out to do, this release delivers one major feature: Batch API implementation - a crucial addition that enhances functionality. However, the issue preventing access to display_value and link values for TableEntry remains unresolved. This bug fix required deeper investigation, and coupled with some unforeseen personal commitments, I decided to prioritize shipping this update now rather than delay it further. Rest assured, this issue will be tackled in a dedicated v1.7.1 release.</p> <p>I can‚Äôt wait to share more updates with you in the future!</p> <p>you can view the full release <a href="https://github.com/michaeldcanady/servicenow-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.7.0">here</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Pain7578"> /u/Ok-Pain7578 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kcmva6/servicenow_sdk_for_go_v170_is_here/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kcmva6/servicenow_sdk_for_go_v170_is_here/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Here I&#39;m eliminating C library called `ogg-packer` and switching to Go-native ogg encoder implementation.</p> <p>In concurrent services you get audio data by chunks, so you have to use C library for adding audio packets (pages) into an ogg stream on-the-fly. Of course you can wait for all chunks and make it in one call to C ogg-packer lib. But in highload systems you should make it concurrently for better real-time-factor and response time.</p> <p>I&#39;m new to Golang (about 1 year), so I don&#39;t fully understand library layout standards and not so good in Go/CGO.</p> <p>Asking for help from community.

Not perfect, but good.</p> <p>SO AGAIN MY QUESTION...</p> <p>Is AI translation better than no translation for a small indie game?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>EDIT: Seems like a good route to take would be to launch in English and then if comments roll in about wishing it was in a certain language, at that point I would consider paying someone to localize.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dirtyderkus"> /u/dirtyderkus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kcer9d/do_you_use_the_forbidden_ai_to_translate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kcer9d/do_you_use_the_forbidden_ai_to_translate/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I made a comment in another thread about how I once quit my job to work on my game. I&#39;ll share more details below.</p> <p>So the background is that I started working on a game in my spare time. Initially I loved it, because it made me feel like life wasn&#39;t all about work. That there was more to life than my corporate software development job.</p> <p>I worked on it for maybe a year, and started getting antsy. I wanted to quit and do my own thing. I wanted to be like those guys from ID software, who started from nothing and led Rockstar lives (ironically ID software actually didn&#39;t quit their jobs until they know they would make it as a studio).</p> <p>Around this time, the company that I was working for was acquired by another company. This would mean that my role would move further away and would necessitate a longer commute. I saw this as a sign that I should quit my job and work on my game full time.</p> <p>So that&#39;s what I did. I quit my job, and cashed in all of my savings that I had up until that time, including savings that I had made for retirement, and started working on my game full time. I abandoned what I had been working on thus far, and started on a new project. This was because the old project was an action RPG, and I realized that the art requirements alone would be prohibitively costly. So I decided on a turn based tactical game which I thought would be less art intensive.</p> <p>It&#39;s worth pointing out that one of the mistakes that I made was not to go the whole prototype route, but to basically immediately begin rolling my own game engine in C++ using free and open source components. Yes, C++. This was about 10 years ago, if you&#39;re curious.</p> <p>It was, however, amazing. Of all of the time I&#39;ve spent working, this was by far the most fun. Writing CRUD code for a corporation is boring. Writing C++ game code for your own game idea is amazing. I could work all day and never get bored or tired. I worked basically 7 days a week and it never felt like work. I think I took around 2 weeks off to play games, but otherwise I just worked, and I loved it.</p> <p>I hired people to create the art and sound assets that I needed, including a UI. So that cost me a bit of money, but actually I did a good job of keeping the budget under control, considering I didn&#39;t have much money to start with.</p> <p>The plan was to work on the game for as long as I could, build a demo, get feedback, and then use that to get further investment. I did have an investor lined up but I needed to demonstrate that the game had potential.</p> <p>But after about 6 months, my money started to dry up. I had something that was approaching a demo, but not polished enough to release. I borrowed some money from family to keep me going another month and then looked for a job. I took a contract job, intending to work on the game part time. I did, for a few months, but my passion was waning. I was tired. It wasn&#39;t rewarding.</p> <p>I think part of the problem was... it was like, I needed to get my game out there to get feedback, but that itself takes a lot of effort. It&#39;s difficult. And maybe I was scared of negative feedback. So I didn&#39;t do very much outreach. And I knew that the demo that I had created had jank - I think it actually looked decent in terms of presentation, but there was too much jank. It just felt off, projectile collisions weren&#39;t satisfying etc. The little things that are hard to get right.</p> <p>So it kinda fizzled away. I ended up with this game demo that was never really completed, some cool memories, and a whole in my finances. I had to go back and get a job. 10 years later, I&#39;m developing a game again, but with a new approach.</p> <p>What would I do differently?</p> <ul> <li>If you want to use your savings on a game, spend them on artwork, sound and UI. Not living expenses. Use them for things you can&#39;t do yourself and let your job pay your living expenses.</li> <li>Pace yourself, its a marathon. I started out strong and fast, but burned myself out having burned through all of my capital and my own emotional energy.</li> <li>Build prototypes, its worth it. Start small. Throw them away if you must.</li> <li>It&#39;s hard to get the balance right between building games for yourself and for others. Build games too customised for your preferences, and nobody else will play them. Build games too generic and people will dump on them as clones.</li> <li>If you must quit your job, do so when you already have a game that is good enough to show to others and those others have already told you that your game is good. Not has potential - is good. And those others must not be immediate family.</li> <li>Getting that feedback and engagement is critical, not only because you need that feedback but because you need people to know what your game is. And you need to be receptive to that feedback. This takes a whole lot of energy and effort and you mustn&#39;t under estimate it. Without this, you&#39;ll have a game nobody wants to buy.</li> <li>Only build something from scratch in a difficult language like C++ if you can justify the time it will take. This would probably mean you should already be making money from the same game written in a different language or engine.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AngelOfLastResort"> /u/AngelOfLastResort </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kc43ka/my_experience_of_quitting_my_job_to_work_on_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kc43ka/my_experience_of_quitting_my_job_to_work_on_my/">[comments]</a></span></div>
