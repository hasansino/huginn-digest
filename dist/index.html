            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ngl, Go seems too good to be true, the simplicity and its blazingly fast speed made me wanna try it.</p> <p>So I learned some basics and made an <a href="https://github.com/sahaj-b/go-attend">Attendance Tracker TUI</a> with zero external dependencies (Only STDLib is used), coz why not.</p> <p>Implementing rendering, state management(with caching), config parsing and csv handling from scratch was fun.</p> <p>Coming from Python/C++/Typescript, some things looked odd. Capitalized exports, error handling, time formatting and all the core method operations are functions now</p> <p>But soon I realised that I like it. capitalized exports are clean, and Go&#39;s error handling is just superior than any other language imo. gonna implement this error handling pattern in Typescript.</p> <p>I get why there are package level functions for common operations instead of methods(like .append(), .split(), etc). Importing a library and it populating the methods/receivers of a type can be a mess.</p> <p>But I didn&#39;t get the time format specifiers. Why not just use strftime? And I know there&#39;s a pattern to Go magic date, but that too is in American date format(MM-DD-YY).</p> <p>Also, Go not having &#39;true&#39; enums wasn&#39;t on my bingo card. The iota workaround is a bit clunky.</p> <p>Overall, it was a blast. This might be my favourite language. Looking forward to build more stuff, probably a backend server</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SAHAJbhatt"> /u/SAHAJbhatt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1klt5q8/my_initial_impressions_of_go_a_fromscratch_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1klt5q8/my_initial_impressions_of_go_a_fromscratch_project/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a low level C developer for several decades and found myself faced with a Rust project I needed to build from scratch. Learning the language itself has been easier than figuring out how to write &quot;idiomatic&quot; code. For example:</p> <p>- How does one choose between adding logic to process N types of things as a trait method on those things, or add a builder with N different processing methods? With traits it feels like I am overloading my struct definitions to be read as config, used as input into more core logic, these structs can do everything. In C I feel like data can only have one kind of interaction with logic, whereas Rust there are many ways to go about doing the same thing - trait on object, objects that processes object, function that processes object (the C way).</p> <p>- When does one add a new wrapper type to something versus using it directly? In C when using a library I would just use it directly without adding my own abstraction. In Rust, it feels like I should be defining another set of types and an interface which adds considerably more code. How does one go about designing layering in Rust?</p> <p>- When are top level functions idiomatic? I don&#39;t see a lot of functions that aren&#39;t methods or part of a trait definition. There are many functions attached to types as well that seem to blur the line between using the type as a module scope versus being directly related to working with the type.</p> <p>- When does one prefer writing in a C like style with loops versus creating long chains of methods over an iterator?</p> <p>I guess I am looking for principles of design for Rust, but written for someone coming from C who does not want to over abstract the way that I have often seen done in C++.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MasteredConduct"> /u/MasteredConduct </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klvdgg/under_abstracting_as_a_c_developer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klvdgg/under_abstracting_as_a_c_developer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve posted about my nonlinear least squares fitting library <code>varpro</code>. Last weekend marked the <code>0.13</code> release, which brings several improvements, among them:</p> <ul> <li>approx. <strong>30% faster global fitting</strong> of problems with multiple right hand sides</li> <li>an MRSV policy</li> <li>refactorings which should be barely noticeable, but make the overall structure of the project much cleaner and enable future improvements.</li> </ul> <h1>What is varpro?</h1> <p>Please check the Readme and docs for details, in short: <code>varpro</code> is a library for fitting nonlinear <em>separable</em> models much more efficiently than general purpose nonlinear least squares solvers. <em>Separable</em> nonlinear models can be written as a linear combination of nonlinear functions, e.g.:</p> <pre><code>f(t) = c1 * exp( (t-t0)/tau1 ) + c2 * exp( (t-t0)/tau2 ) </code></pre> <p>The example above is a double exponential decay, which is a typical application. Much more complicated models are possible as long as they can be written as a linear combination of nonlinear functions.</p> <h1>Why Give it a Shot?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Performance</strong>: If your problem is separable, it&#39;s significantly faster and more robust than using a general purpose solver.</li> <li><strong>Usability</strong>: There is a builder interface that allows you to describe your model functions easily and with good performance out of the box. For advanced users there is an advanced interface.</li> <li><strong>Global Fitting</strong>: <code>varpro</code> allows <a href="https://docs.rs/varpro/0.13.0/varpro/#global-fitting-with-multiple-right-hand-sides">global fitting</a> with multiple right hand sides. This is a powerful approach, where applicable.</li> <li><strong>Fit Statistics</strong>: calculate not only the best fit parameters but also their uncertainties (cf below)</li> </ul> <h1>Future Work</h1> <ul> <li><strong>More Statistics</strong>: Right now, fit statistics can only be calculated for single right hand side case, but I know how to do it for multiple right hand sides. Just haven&#39;t gotten round to implementing it.</li> <li><strong>Backend-Agility</strong>: As of now, varpro is pretty tightly integrated with it&#39;s matrix backend (nalgebra) and it&#39;s nonlinear solver backend (levenberg-marquardt). I want to change that, so that different matrix and solver backends can be plugged in, similar to how <code>argmin-rs</code> does it.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/geo-ant"> /u/geo-ant </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/geo-ant/varpro">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klrhnd/varpro_013_nonlinear_fitting_now_faster_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;ve just released <a href="https://crates.io/crates/discrete_pid">discrete_pid</a>, a PID controller for robotics and discrete systems.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://docs.rs/discrete_pid">https://docs.rs/discrete_pid</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/Hs293Go/discrete_pid">https://github.com/Hs293Go/discrete_pid</a></li> </ul> <p>Since I&#39;m still new to Rust (and this community), I initially tried to learn by hacking a PID to solve a balancing-cart problem. I then realized the design space for PID controllers in Rust was far from saturated, so I decided to polish my PID code and publish.</p> <p>I built this controller on two foundations:</p> <ul> <li>First, the design should be based on strong existing implementations. I used the <a href="https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/">Brett Beauregard&#39;s Arduino PID</a> as my reference and tried to implement most of the features from his blog <a href="http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/"><em>Improving the Beginner‚Äôs PID</em></a>.</li> <li>Second, the controller should achieve <strong>numerical parity with Simulink&#39;s Discrete PID controller</strong> to show that discrete-time design requirements are met. You can find these tests in <a href="https://github.com/Hs293Go/discrete_pid/blob/main/tests/sim.rs"><code>tests/sim.rs</code></a> and read about them in <a href="https://github.com/Hs293Go/discrete_pid/blob/main/tests/README.md"><code>tests/README.md</code></a>.</li> </ul> <p>I also tried to innovate a little: After spending time with <a href="https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/stateful-computations.html">JAX</a> and functional neural networks, I&#39;m drawn towards functional design, so I created a dual API: a <code>FuncPidController</code> with a pure <code>compute</code></p> <pre><code>let (output, ctx) = pid.compute(ctx, input, setpoint, timestamp, Some(feedforward)); </code></pre> <p>alongside a conventional stateful <code>PidController</code>. This made testing/debugging <strong>much</strong> easier, but the downside is a noticeable performance hit compared to the stateful version. I&#39;d love to know if others have explored this functional/stateful separation in control code and its impact on performance.</p> <p>To test the PID before I got the hang of embedded rust, I coded a quadrotor simulator and put my PID controller into the navigation loop. The PID controller tracks setpoints computed by Mellinger and Kumar&#39;s geometric controller (though no minimum snap trajectory generator yet). You can find it under <a href="https://github.com/Hs293Go/discrete_pid/tree/main/examples"><code>examples/</code></a>.</p> <p>I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, whether it‚Äôs on PID design, Simulink interoperability, functional Rust, or just my Rust code in general. Constructive criticism is especially welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hs123go"> /u/hs123go </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klmc65/discrete_pid_010_a_pid_controller_for_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klmc65/discrete_pid_010_a_pid_controller_for_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It‚Äôs designed for performance ‚Äî relying almost solely on the GPU for rendering. It features a novel styling system, based on the idea of using shaders to adjust the look and feel of your application. To this end, it also features a custom DSL, including a shader language that compiles to multiple graphics backends.</p> <p>A major feature of Makepad‚Äôs DSL is real-time UI editing: Makepad apps listen for changes to their DSL source code and update themselves at runtime to reflect the new code. This allows developers to adjust the layout and style of their app without having to do an expensive recompilation step on each change.</p> <p>Makepad currently works on all major native platforms (OS X, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android) as well as the web (via WASM builds).</p> <p>This is an early release ‚Äî lots of core stuff works, and you can build real apps with Makepad today. In fact, there are some real apps being built with Makepad today: Robrix, a Rust Matrix client <a href="https://github.com/project-robius/robrix">https://github.com/project-robius/robrix</a></p> <p>Moly, a Rust AI LLM client <a href="https://github.com/moxin-org/moly">https://github.com/moxin-org/moly</a></p> <p>To get a better overview of what Makepad can do, you might also want to check out our UI zoo (currently desktop only): <a href="https://makepad.nl/makepad-example-ui-zoo/index.html">https://makepad.nl/makepad-example-ui-zoo/index.html</a></p> <p>That said, there are still some rough edges and missing bits.

Sorry, i accidentally removed the original post)</p> <p>``<code>rs // This won&#39;t compile because // cannot borrow</code>a` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable fn main() { let mut a = 5;</p> <pre><code>let immutable_borrow = &amp;a; let mutable_borrow = &amp;mut a; *mutable_borrow = 7; println!(&quot;a is {}&quot;, immutable_borrow); </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mentalrob"> /u/mentalrob </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klfvdh/why_cant_i_take_mutable_and_immutable_borrows_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1klfvdh/why_cant_i_take_mutable_and_immutable_borrows_at/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It&#39;s called Fast Binary Ultracache (FastBu), it&#39;s an on-disk caching library that uses in-memory indexes. Probably good for cases where the index is short but the cache value is very long.<br/> There are still a ton of issues to be solved (maybe some will question the usage of Warp!) but would be glad to get some feedback and get some reading done on suggested resources. </p> <p>Here is the link to the repo:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/adelra/fastbu">https://github.com/adelra/fastbu</a> </p> <p>So far a few things that really amazed me about Rust:</p> <p>1) The amazing compiler tells you anything that is not going well</p> <p>2) Cargo is king!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I wanted to write a long post today. As indie game developers, there&#39;s an advice we hear all the time: ‚ÄúIdentify the hook of your game!‚Äù That is, find the most important feature that makes it stand out from other games. For example, for Baba Is You ‚ÄúYou set the rules of the game by changing the words.‚Äù or for Papers, Please ‚ÄúBureaucracy and ethical dilemmas through the eyes of a border crossing officer.‚Äù etc.</p> <p>This is very good, but I recently read a blog post that expanded my vision and I wanted to write about it here too. As Chris Zukovski writes on his <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2019/12/23/know-your-games-anchor/">blog</a>, people often buy a game because they like the genre, because a friend recommended it, or because they&#39;ve played something similar before. That&#39;s where &quot;Anchor&quot; comes in. Chris says he made up the word himself, and I think it&#39;s a good one :)</p> <p>Anchor is what makes your game feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù to players. I mean, hook makes your game special, anchor makes it familiar. Here are some common anchors that influence players&#39; decision to buy games:</p> <ul> <li>Friend recommendation: If someone you trust says ‚ÄúThis game is great!‚Äù, it&#39;s easier to buy.</li> <li>Influencer effects: If a favorite YouTuber or Twitch streamer has played it, your interest is increased. <ul> <li>I want to go through this in my game. I even explained my plan to collect 1000 emails <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1kjj8gu/i_found_close_to_1000_streamer_emails_heres_my/">here</a>.</li> </ul></li> <li>Series or sequel: If it&#39;s a sequel to a game you&#39;ve played and loved before, you feel trusted.</li> <li>Trust in the studio: If it&#39;s a new game from a developer who has made great games before, your expectations are high.</li> <li>Genre addiction: Some gamers are loyal to certain genres. If you belong to a favorite genre, you have a better chance.</li> </ul> <p>After reading this blog post, I started to look at game design and marketing in a much different way. For some reason, it&#39;s not talked about much. It is a very underrated subject. Have you heard about it, what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InevGames"> /u/InevGames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klwc3p/the_most_insightful_game_dev_article_ive_ever/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klwc3p/the_most_insightful_game_dev_article_ive_ever/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I recently had the pleasure of interviewing the director of anti-cheat at Blizzard, and I wanted to share it with you all. Below is a summary of the discussion, with best-effort timestamps.</p> <h1>Background:</h1> <p>His interest in computer science and cybersecurity stemmed from his teenage experiences hacking with Diablo. He went on to study computer science at the University of Dayton (BS) and Carnegie Mellon (MS). Afterwards, he jumped around working in government and defense sectors before moving to the automotive industry. He joined Blizzard working as the Associate Director of Games Security Engineering ~8 months ago, and currently leads their anti-cheat efforts.</p> <h1>Game Security:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>AI&#39;s Role in Cheat Creation:</strong> AI tools are becoming increasingly accessible, allowing cheat developers to create more intelligent and efficient cheats, posing a new challenge for game security engineers (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=PhdBICyWQdih_2ou&amp;t=1294">21:34</a>).</li> <li><strong>Filtering False Reports:</strong> With millions of players, filtering legitimate cheating reports from noise and false accusations is a significant data problem (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=Fs00LbyOFyhKzypZ&amp;t=2500">41:40</a>).</li> <li><strong>Lack of Universal Kernel Anti-Cheat:</strong> The reason why companies like Blizzard don&#39;t adopt kernel-level anti-cheat. Touching on issues like user dissatisfaction and stability (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=dorraj_gMSRnnVeE&amp;t=2917">48:37</a>).</li> <li><strong>Linux Security Challenges:</strong> What is the future of anti-cheat on Linux, and the problems that go along with securing an open source OS (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=BdhiozuxtpFFFv4H&amp;t=3707">1:01:47</a>).</li> <li><strong>Automatic Detection:</strong> The possibilities and limitations of fully automated cheat bans, highlighting the importance of human review (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=xOFn6bwqQUw9JYr8&amp;t=4146">1:09:06</a>).</li> <li><strong>Cheat Creation Process:</strong> The motivations behind cheat development, including profit, ego, and a passion for reverse engineering (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=QaFMquwDHjHMIxq7&amp;t=4303">1:11:43</a>).</li> <li><strong>Smurfing:</strong> Is smurfing &quot;cheating&quot;- and the original meaning of &quot;surfing&quot; in cybersecurity (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=6SxMhEEyhLmGF1EM&amp;t=4932">1:22:12</a>).</li> <li><strong>Custom Engine Security:</strong> How custom game engines affect the control given to security engineers, and the efforts of cheat developers (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=jPg1Sl8KD38KO4eb&amp;t=5070">1:24:30</a>).</li> </ul> <h1>Advice:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Perseverance:</strong> Finding a job in the game industry, especially at large studios, requires patience and persistence (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=jWmg8wbKh50rnT1M&amp;t=5340">1:29:00</a>).</li> <li><strong>Focus on Diverse Skills:</strong> Developing security expertise can be a valuable asset for game developers, even those who are not working directly on game security features (<a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=aRY5G1agVFqK1-oV&amp;t=5484">1:31:23</a>).</li> </ul> <p>Here is the full interview:</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=ghKysAGi8z5hZnR7&amp;t=55">https://youtu.be/M2bT-a_RFPY?si=ghKysAGi8z5hZnR7&amp;t=55</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Yoyolick"> /u/Yoyolick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klvkp2/blizzard_anticheat_director_interview/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klvkp2/blizzard_anticheat_director_interview/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This industry has me stressed out constantly, and I could really use some advice.</p> <p>For background- I‚Äôve been a Technical Artist for about 3 years now. I was lucky enough to land a job out of college and moved cross country for it. A year later, they laid off my entire department. I worked my ass off to land a job within a month at a remote company, since we had bought a house and moving wasn‚Äôt an option. I was at this company for about a year before it became obvious our future was uncertain. Contracts were drying up. I started getting my portfolio together. 6 months ago, we had layoffs and pay cuts. I started applying. I never got to the second round of interviews anywhere. A few weeks ago, my company went on furlough with no guarantee of a return due to lack of contracts. I ramped up my applications, but all I‚Äôm getting are rejections and there aren‚Äôt very many companies out there to apply to.</p> <p>Due to the industry drying up over the past few years, I have no big names in my portfolio. I keep getting auto-rejected from senior positions due to my short time in the industry and lack of AAA names, but there are no mid-level or junior roles to even apply to. I‚Äôve been trying to hard to network and reach out to my contacts but there‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôve even been applying to work in other states and countries and offered to move, still nothing.</p> <p>My entire adult life, I‚Äôve never known stability. I don‚Äôt know if I can take it anymore. I hate the idea of applying to a shitton of jobs just to maybe get one if I‚Äôm lucky, just to be forced to move somewhere else, just to be laid off again and start this whole process over again.</p> <p>My partner gets mad when I talk about leaving, saying I‚Äôm so lucky to have a cool job and be creative and do work I care about. I do love this industry, and I don‚Äôt want to have to leave it. But I‚Äôm just so sick of the constant stress and instability, I don‚Äôt know if I can take it anymore.</p> <p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Some games, even if they weren&#39;t widely popular, were clearly very successful and brought in hundreds of thousands or even millions in revenue.

If your first game does that well, wouldn&#39;t you feel more motivated to make another one?</p> <p>So what happens after the success that makes some developers stop? burnout? Creative pressure? reached their financial goal? Or maybe they are working on their new game, but I doubt that since many of these games I am talking about were very simple and possibly made in a few months.</p> <p>For my case, I developed a game that generated a decent income (500+ reviews) but that made me more excited to develop a new game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shn_mee"> /u/Shn_mee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klixw2/why_do_some_solo_devs_stop_making_games_even/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1klixw2/why_do_some_solo_devs_stop_making_games_even/">[comments]</a></span></div>
