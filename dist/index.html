            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just released an open source library that makes it easy to test things that use <code>time.Sleep</code>, <code>time.Ticker</code>, <code>time.Timer</code>, etc. reliably and efficiently. There&#39;s a few other libraries that provide injectable clock-like things but I found them hard to use with concurrent code. For example, if you have a clock that lets you control time and your testing code that calls <code>time.Sleep</code>, it&#39;s not always clear when you should advance it - if you advance it before <code>time.Sleep</code> is called it won&#39;t have the desired effect. I&#39;d like to think this library makes it relatively easy to test highly concurrent code that uses time delays.

I am new to go so I am sorry if those questions are stupid.</p> <p>First, is there some way to avoid type conversions, I have started building a little terrain generator using raylib-go which for most of it&#39;s functions uses 32bit data types. So whenever I want to use some math function from go I have to do lot&#39;s of type conversions so then I have lines like this: `height := float32(math.Pow(float64(rl.GetImageColor(noiseImg, int32(i), int32(j)).R), 0.65))`. Is there any way I can avoid this?</p> <p>My second question is why can&#39;t go do the conversion for me, I understand not wanting to convert from for example float to an int because there could be data loss, the same goes for converting from int64 to int32, but why doesn&#39;t it convert automatically from int32 to int64. Like I can&#39;t lose any data and it would just make life easier.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tuzu128"> /u/Tuzu128 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kg9lpp/questions_about_types_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kg9lpp/questions_about_types_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is useful if your build infrastructure lags behind the latest and greatest Go version and you are unable to upgrade yet. (*)</p> <p>It solves the following problem of <code>go get -u</code> pushing for the latest Go version, even if you explicitly use a specific version of Go:</p> <pre><code>$ go1.21.0 get -u golang.org/x/tools@latest go: upgraded go 1.21.0 =&gt; 1.22.0 </code></pre> <p>The tool works in a simple way by upgrading all direct dependencies one by one while watching the &quot;go&quot; statement in go.mod. It <strong>skips dependencies</strong> which would have upgrade Go version. The tool can be used from the CLI and has several additional features like executing arbitrary commands (go build / go test typically) for every update to ensure everything works fine:</p> <pre><code>go run github.com/lzap/gobump@latest -exec &quot;go build ./...&quot; -exec &quot;go test ./...&quot; </code></pre> <p>Sharing since this might be helpful, this is really painful to solve with Go.

While it is obvious to &quot;just upgrade Go compiler&quot; there are environments when this does not work that way - those customers will stay on a lower version that will receive additional bugfixes on top of it. In my case, we are on Red Hat Go Toolset for UBI that is typically one to two minor versions behind.</p> <p>Another example is a Go compiler from a linux distribution when you want to stick with that version for any reason.

I am going to be honest, I can trade stocks and am great with fintech but I know from bitter experience I am terrible at sales and I am in no way confident I could get my portfolio project funded even with the slickest imaginable vertical demo.</p> <p>How on earth does anyone get any game development studio to give you the time of day? Be real with me here, we&#39;re on reddit, make a throwaway account if you&#39;re scared to reply but, are people hiring friends and &quot;ringers&quot; who have succeeded on their own? Should I just not even try to get a job through the front door and spend all my time on my own game? Because I have tried this many, many times, I have had I think 6 pivots and I took a shot at goal every pivot over the 20 years I&#39;ve been working in the development industry. And I am starting to wonder if human beings that make hiring decisions actually exist.</p> <p>Sorry for the frustrated and admittedly crass tone, but I decided to just write it out instead of searching through reddit and finding a bunch of other replies from people that aren&#39;t quite what I&#39;m looking for and convincing myself my question is answered. I&#39;m going to hit submit, I am not going to line up to kick the football again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kireina_kaiju"> /u/kireina_kaiju </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kgjllc/is_there_any_way_to_break_into_this_industry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kgjllc/is_there_any_way_to_break_into_this_industry/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I knew about buying a steam page which is fine for me, but I never realised I would need a code signing certificate to release on steam, and from looking online they seem to be really quite expensive. A digicert certificate is around $800 per year, and although I have found some for around $250, I just didn‚Äôt realise this was a requirement. I guess the main reason I‚Äôm surprised is that I‚Äôve seen a bunch of games on steam that seem to have been uploaded almost as a joke, like banana or similar games (I know this game does make money) and yet these developers are paying such high prices. I do understand that certificates can be used on multiple games so they might have a main game that makes money and then use the certificate on other, less important games. And I do know I could release on itch.io or GOG (I think?) but people just don‚Äôt go to itch to find a game really. I just want to hear what others think, specifically about just starting and releasing first games. I just don‚Äôt see myself releasing my game anymore. </p> <p>EDIT: seems like I‚Äôm completely wrong and you don‚Äôt need a certificate to release on steam.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>So my game&#39;s build on Steam got rejected because I don&#39;t support a controller that&#39;s discontinued (Steam Controller), despite stating that my game has no controller support at all (which the reviewer even acknowledged). The provided reason for failure was that an on-screen virtual keyboard doesn&#39;t appear when using Steam Controller. And now I&#39;m wondering what to do next.</p> <p>Even if I had a Steam Controller configuration and supported it, I think there&#39;s something called &quot;partial controller support&quot; where one of its points is that an on-screen keyboard doesn&#39;t appear, and many games have it, but in this case it&#39;s somehow treated as mandatory?</p> <p>I&#39;m using Steam Input for SteamDeck, but I didn&#39;t check Steam Controller support checkbox anywhere (it&#39;s not even on the list anywhere) and I don&#39;t advertise controller support. The Steam Input vdf config only has controller_neptune entry, it doesn&#39;t have controller_steamcontroller and the game doesn&#39;t have Steam Controller config anywhere else. Does it mean that if I support SteamDeck, I must also support a discontinued Steam Controller, otherwise the game will be rejected?</p> <p>At the moment my only option seems to be to drop SteamDeck support entirely, which would be disappointing as it&#39;s fully supported at the moment (with on-screen keyboard, since SteamDeck provides it).</p> <p>Any advice on what I should do in this case? Would you drop SteamDeck support altogether?</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong> I‚Äôve appealed and received an update from a different person who confirmed that <strong>if you support SteamDeck, then you have to support all other controllers as well</strong>. PSA: If you don‚Äôt plan to support all controllers yet, don‚Äôt add SteamDeck support before your game is approved</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rogueatic"> /u/Rogueatic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kg1o0i/my_steam_game_build_got_rejected_because_i_dont/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kg1o0i/my_steam_game_build_got_rejected_because_i_dont/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>\</em>edit 1: better code formatting*</p> <p>I consider myself a junior Rust developer. I have been learning Rust for a few months now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed the process. </p> <p>Recently, we started writing the <a href="https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb-rs-next-gen">next generation</a> of FalkorDB using Rust. We chose Rust because of its performance, safety, and rich type system. One part we are implementing by hand is the scanner and parser. We do this to optimize performance and to maintain a clean AST (abstract syntax tree). We are working with the <a href="https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb-rs-next-gen/blob/main/graph/src/Cypher.g4">Antlr4 Cypher</a> grammar, where each Derivation in the grammar maps to a Rust function.</p> <p>For example, consider the parse rule for a NOT expression:</p> <pre><code>```antlr oC_NotExpression : ( NOT SP? )* oC_ComparisonExpression ; ``` </code></pre> <p>This corresponds to the Rust function:</p> <pre><code>```rust fn parse_not_expr(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;QueryExprIR, String&gt; { let mut not_count = 0; while self.lexer.current() == Token::Not { self.lexer.next(); not_count += 1; } let expr = self.parse_comparison_expr()?; if not_count % 2 == 0 { Ok(expr) } else { Ok(QueryExprIR::Not(Box::new(expr))) } } ``` </code></pre> <p>Here, we compress consecutive NOT expressions during parsing, but otherwise, the procedure closely resembles the Antlr4 grammar. The function first consumes zero or more NOT tokens, then calls <code>parse_comparison_expr</code></p> <p>While working on the parser, a recurring pattern emerged. Many expressions follow the form:</p> <pre><code>```antlrv4 oC_ComparisonExpression : oC_OrExpression ( ( SP? COMPARISON_OPERATOR SP? ) oC_OrExpression )* ; ``` </code></pre> <p>which translates roughly to:</p> <pre><code>```rust fn parse_comparison_expr(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;QueryExprIR, String&gt; { let mut expr = self.parse_or_expr()?; while self.lexer.current() == Token::ComparisonOperator { let op = self.lexer.current(); self.lexer.next(); let right = self.parse_or_expr()?; expr = QueryExprIR::BinaryOp(Box::new(expr), op, Box::new(right)); } Ok(expr) } ``` </code></pre> <p>Similarly, for addition and subtraction:</p> <pre><code>```antlrv4 oC_AddOrSubtractExpression : oC_MultiplyDivideModuloExpression ( ( SP? &#39;+&#39; SP? oC_MultiplyDivideModuloExpression ) | ( SP? &#39;-&#39; SP? oC_MultiplyDivideModuloExpression ) )* ; ``` </code></pre> <p>which looks like this in Rust:</p> <pre><code>```rust fn parse_add_sub_expr(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;QueryExprIR, String&gt; { let mut vec = Vec::new(); vec.push(self.parse_mul_div_modulo_expr()?); loop { while Token::Plus == self.lexer.current() { self.lexer.next(); vec.push(self.parse_mul_div_modulo_expr()?); } if vec.len() &gt; 1 { vec = vec!(QueryExprIR::Add(vec)); } while Token::Dash == self.lexer.current() { self.lexer.next(); vec.push(self.parse_mul_div_modulo_expr()?); } if vec.len() &gt; 1 { vec = vec!(QueryExprIR::Sub(vec)); } if ![Token::Plus, Token::Dash].contains(&amp;self.lexer.current()) { return Ok(vec.pop().unwrap()); } }; } ``` </code></pre> <p>This pattern appeared repeatedly with one, two, or three operators. Although the code is not very complicated, it would be nice to have a macro that generates this code for us. We envisioned a macro that takes the expression parser and pairs of (token, AST constructor) like this:</p> <pre><code>```rust parse_binary_expr!(self.parse_mul_div_modulo_expr()?, Plus =&gt; Add, Dash =&gt; Sub); ``` </code></pre> <p>So I started exploring how to write procedural macros in Rust, and I must say it was a very pleasant experience. With the help of the crates quote and syn, I was able to write a procedural macro that generates this code automatically. The quote crate lets you generate token streams from templates, and syn allows parsing Rust code into syntax trees and token streams. Using these two crates makes writing procedural macros in Rust feel like writing a compiler extension.</p> <p>Let&#39;s get into the code.</p> <p>The first step is to model your macro syntax using Rust data structures. In our case, I used two structs:</p> <pre><code>```rust struct BinaryOp { parse_exp: Expr, binary_op_alts: Vec&lt;BinaryOpAlt&gt;, } struct BinaryOpAlt { token_match: syn::Ident, ast_constructor: syn::Ident, } ``` </code></pre> <p>The leaves of these structs are data types from the syn crate. Expr represents any Rust expression, and syn::Ident</p> <p>represents an identifier.</p> <p>Next, we parse the token stream into these data structures. This is straightforward with syn by implementing the Parse trait:</p> <pre><code>```rust impl Parse for BinaryOp { fn parse(input: ParseStream) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt; { let parse_exp = input.parse()?; _ = input.parse::&lt;syn::Token![,]&gt;()?; let binary_op_alts = syn::punctuated::Punctuated::&lt;BinaryOpAlt, syn::Token![,]&gt;::parse_separated_nonempty( input, )?; Ok(Self { parse_exp, binary_op_alts: binary_op_alts.into_iter().collect(), }) } } impl Parse for BinaryOpAlt { fn parse(input: ParseStream) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt; { let token_match = input.parse()?; _ = input.parse::&lt;syn::Token![=&gt;]&gt;()?; let ast_constructor = input.parse()?; Ok(Self { token_match, ast_constructor, }) } } ``` </code></pre> <p>The syn crate smartly parses the token stream into the data structures based on the expected types (Token, Expr, Ident, or BinaryOpAlt).</p> <p>The final step is to generate the appropriate code from these data structures using the quote crate, which lets you write Rust code templates that generate token streams. This is done by implementing the ToTokens trait:</p> <pre><code>```rust impl quote::ToTokens for BinaryOp { fn to_tokens( &amp;self, tokens: &amp;mut proc_macro2::TokenStream, ) { let binary_op_alts = &amp;self.binary_op_alts; let parse_exp = &amp;self.parse_exp; let stream = generate_token_stream(parse_exp, binary_op_alts); tokens.extend(stream); } } fn generate_token_stream( parse_exp: &amp;Expr, alts: &amp;[BinaryOpAlt], ) -&gt; proc_macro2::TokenStream { let whiles = alts.iter().map(|alt| { let token_match = &amp;alt.token_match; let ast_constructor = &amp;alt.ast_constructor; quote::quote! { while Token::#token_match == self.lexer.current() { self.lexer.next(); vec.push(#parse_exp); } if vec.len() &gt; 1 { vec = vec![QueryExprIR::#ast_constructor(vec)]; } } }); let tokens = alts.iter().map(|alt| { let token_match = &amp;alt.token_match; quote::quote! { Token::#token_match } }); quote::quote! { let mut vec = Vec::new(); vec.push(#parse_exp); loop { #(#whiles)* if ![#(#tokens,)*].contains(&amp;self.lexer.current()) { return Ok(vec.pop().unwrap()); } } } } ``` </code></pre> <p>In generate_token_stream, we first generate the collection of while loops for each operator, then place them inside a loop using the repetition syntax `<code>#(#whiles)*</code>`. And that&#39;s it!</p> <p>You can find the full code <a href="https://github.com/FalkorDB/falkordb-rs-next-gen/tree/main/falkordb-macro">here</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Striking-Bluejay6155"> /u/Striking-Bluejay6155 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kfy8qy/rust_procedural_macros_beginners_thoughts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kfy8qy/rust_procedural_macros_beginners_thoughts/">[comments]</a></span></div>
