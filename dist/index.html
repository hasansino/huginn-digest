    <h1>Go Cryptography Security Audit</h1>
      
      <p class="author">
      Roland Shoemaker and Filippo Valsorda<br>
      19 May 2025
      </p>
      
      <p>Go ships with a full suite of cryptography packages in the standard library to help developers build secure applications. Google recently contracted the independent security firm <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Trail of Bits</a> to complete an audit of the core set of packages that are also validated as part of the <a href="/doc/go1.24#fips140">new native FIPS 140-3 module</a>. The audit produced a single low-severity finding, in the legacy and unsupported <a href="/doc/security/fips140#goboringcrypto">Go+BoringCrypto integration</a>, and a handful of informational findings. The full text of the audit report can be found <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/d47e8fafa7e3323e5620d228f2f3f3bf58ed5978/reviews/2025-03-google-gocryptographiclibraries-securityreview.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The scope of the audit included our implementations of key exchange (ECDH and post-quantum ML-KEM), digital signature (ECDSA, RSA, and Ed25519), encryption (AES-GCM, AES-CBC, and AES-CTR), hashing (SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3), key derivation (HKDF and PBKDF2), and authentication (HMAC), as well as the cryptographic random number generator. Low-level big integer and elliptic curve implementations, with their delicate assembly cores, were included. Higher level protocols like TLS and X.509 were not in scope. Three Trail of Bits engineers worked on the audit for a month.</p>
<p>We are proud of the security track record of the Go cryptography packages, and of the outcome of this audit, which is just one of many ways we gain assurance of the packages‚Äô correctness. First, we aggressively limit their complexity, guided by the <a href="/design/cryptography-principles">Cryptography Principles</a> which for example prioritize security over performance. Further, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkEH3V3PkS0" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">thoroughly test them</a> with an array of different techniques. We make a point of leveraging safe APIs even for internal packages, and naturally we can rely on the Go language properties to avoid memory management issues. Finally, we focus on readability to make maintenance easier and code review and audits more effective.</p>
<h2 id="one-low-severity-finding">One low-severity finding</h2>
<p>The only potentially exploitable issue, TOB-GOCL-3, has <em>low severity</em>, meaning it had minor impact and was difficult to trigger. This issue has been fixed in the Go 1.25 development tree.</p>
<p>Crucially, TOB-GOCL-3 (<a href="#cgo-memory-management">discussed further below</a>) concerns memory management in the <a href="/doc/security/fips140#goboringcrypto">legacy Go+BoringCrypto GOEXPERIMENT</a>, which is not enabled by default and unsupported for use outside of Google.</p>
<h2 id="five-informational-findings">Five informational findings</h2>
<p>The remaining findings are <em>informational</em>, meaning they do not pose an immediate risk but are relevant to security best practices. We addressed these in the current Go 1.25 development tree.</p>
<p>Findings TOB-GOCL-1, TOB-GOCL-2, and TOB-GOCL-6 concern possible timing side-channels in various cryptographic operations. Of these three findings, only TOB-GOCL-2 affects operations that were expected to be constant time due to operating on secret values, but it only affects Power ISA targets (GOARCH ppc64 and ppc64le). TOB-GOCL-4 highlights misuse risk in an internal API, should it be repurposed beyond its current use case. TOB-GOCL-5 points out a missing check for a limit that is impractical to reach.</p>
<h2 id="timing-side-channels">Timing Side-Channels</h2>
<p>Findings TOB-GOCL-1, TOB-GOCL-2, and TOB-GOCL-6 concern minor timing side-channels. TOB-GOCL-1 and TOB-GOCL-6 are related to functions which we do not use for sensitive values, but could be used for such values in the future, and TOB-GOCL-2 is related to the assembly implementation of P-256 ECDSA on Power ISA.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoecdhcryptoecdsa-conversion-from-bytes-to-field-elements-is-not-constant-time-tob-gocl-1"><code>crypto/ecdh,crypto/ecdsa</code>: conversion from bytes to field elements is not constant time (TOB-GOCL-1)</h3>
<p>The internal implementation of NIST elliptic curves provided a method to convert field elements between an internal and external representation which operated in variable time.</p>
<p>All usages of this method operated on public inputs which are not considered secret (public ECDH values, and ECDSA public keys), so we determined that this was not a security issue. That said, we decided to <a href="/cl/650579">make the method constant time anyway</a>, in order to prevent accidentally using this method in the future with secret values, and so that we don&rsquo;t have to think about whether it is an issue or not.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoecdsa-p-256-conditional-negation-is-not-constant-time-in-power-isa-assembly-tob-gocl-2-cve-2025-22866"><code>crypto/ecdsa</code>: P-256 conditional negation is not constant time in Power ISA assembly (TOB-GOCL-2, CVE-2025-22866)</h3>
<p>Beyond the <a href="/wiki/PortingPolicy#first-class-ports">first class Go platforms</a>, Go also supports a number of additional platforms, including some less common architectures. During the review of our assembly implementations of various underlying cryptographic primitives, the Trail of Bits team found one issue that affected the ECDSA implementation on the ppcs64 and ppc64le architectures.</p>
<p>Due to the usage of a conditional branching instruction in the implementation of the conditional negation of P-256 points, the function operated in variable-time, rather than constant-time, as expected. The fix for this was relatively simple, <a href="/cl/643735">replacing the conditional branching instruction</a> with a pattern we already use elsewhere to conditionally select the correct result in constant time. We assigned this issue CVE-2025-22866.</p>
<p>To prioritize the code that reaches most of our users, and due to the specialized knowledge required to target specific ISAs, we generally rely on community contributions to maintain assembly for non-first class platforms. We thank our partners at IBM for helping provide review for our fix.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoed25519-scalarsetcanonicalbytes-is-not-constant-time-tob-gocl-6"><code>crypto/ed25519</code>: Scalar.SetCanonicalBytes is not constant time (TOB-GOCL-6)</h3>
<p>The internal edwards25519 package provided a method to convert between an internal and external representation of scalars which operated in variable time.</p>
<p>This method was only used on signature inputs to ed25519.Verify, which are not considered secret, so we determined that this was not a security issue. That said, similarly to the TOB-GOCL-1 finding, we decided to <a href="/cl/648035">make the method constant time anyway</a>, in order to prevent accidentally using this method in the future with secret values, and because we are aware that people fork this code outside of the standard library, and may be using it with secret values.</p>
<h2 id="cgo-memory-management">Cgo Memory Management</h2>
<p>Finding TOB-GOCL-3 concerns a memory management issue in the Go+BoringCrypto integration.</p>
<h3 id="cryptoecdh-custom-finalizer-may-free-memory-at-the-start-of-a-c-function-call-using-this-memory-tob-gocl-3"><code>crypto/ecdh</code>: custom finalizer may free memory at the start of a C function call using this memory (TOB-GOCL-3)</h3>
<p>During the review, there were a number of questions about our cgo-based Go+BoringCrypto integration, which provides a FIPS 140-2 compliant cryptography mode for internal usage at Google. The Go+BoringCrypto code is not supported by the Go team for external use, but has been critical for Google‚Äôs internal usage of Go.</p>
<p>The Trail of Bits team found one vulnerability and one <a href="/cl/644120">non-security relevant bug</a>, both of which were results of the manual memory management required to interact with a C library. Since the Go team does not support usage of this code outside of Google, we have chosen not to issue a CVE or Go vulnerability database entry for this issue, but we <a href="/cl/644119">fixed it in the Go 1.25 development tree</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of pitfall is one of the many reasons that we decided to move away from the Go+BoringCrypto integration. We have been working on a <a href="/doc/security/fips140">native FIPS 140-3 mode</a> that uses the regular pure Go cryptography packages, allowing us to avoid the complex cgo semantics in favor of the traditional Go memory model.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-completeness">Implementation Completeness</h2>
<p>Findings TOB-GOCL-4 and TOB-GOCL-5 concern limited implementations of two specifications, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/a/r1/final" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">NIST SP 800-90A</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8018" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8018</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cryptointernalfips140drbg-ctr-drbg-api-presents-multiple-misuse-risks-tob-gocl-4"><code>crypto/internal/fips140/drbg</code>: CTR_DRBG API presents multiple misuse risks (TOB-GOCL-4)</h3>
<p>As part of the <a href="/doc/security/fips140">native FIPS 140-3 mode</a> that we are introducing, we needed an implementation of the NIST CTR_DRBG (an AES-CTR based deterministic random bit generator) to provide compliant randomness.</p>
<p>Since we only need a small subset of the functionality of the NIST SP 800-90A Rev. 1 CTR_DRBG for our purposes, we did not implement the full specification, in particular omitting the derivation function and personalization strings. These features can be critical to safely use the DRBG in generic contexts.</p>
<p>As our implementation is tightly scoped to the specific use case we need, and since the implementation is not publicly exported, we determined that this was acceptable and worth the decreased complexity of the implementation. We do not expect this implementation to ever be used for other purposes internally, and have <a href="/cl/647815">added a warning to the documentation</a> that details these limitations.</p>
<h3 id="cryptopbkdf2-pbkdf2-does-not-enforce-output-length-limitations-tob-gocl-5"><code>crypto/pbkdf2</code>: PBKDF2 does not enforce output length limitations (TOB-GOCL-5)</h3>
<p>In Go 1.24, we began the process of moving packages from <a href="https://golang.org/x/crypto" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">golang.org/x/crypto</a> into the standard library, ending a confusing pattern where first-party, high-quality, and stable Go cryptography packages were kept outside of the standard library for no particular reason.</p>
<p>As part of this process we moved the <a href="https://golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">golang.org/x/crypto/pbkdf2</a> package into the standard library, as crypto/pbkdf2. While reviewing this package, the Trail of Bits team noticed that we did not enforce the limit on the size of derived keys defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8018" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8018</a>.</p>
<p>The limit is <code>(2^32 - 1) * &lt;hash length&gt;</code>, after which the key would loop. When using SHA-256, exceeding the limit would take a key of more than 137GB. We do not expect anyone has ever used PBKDF2 to generate a key this large, especially because PBKDF2 runs the iterations at every block, but for the sake of correctness, we <a href="/cl/644122">now enforce the limit as defined by the standard</a>.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next</h1>
<p>The results of this audit validate the effort the Go team has put into developing high-quality, easy to use cryptography libraries and should provide confidence to our users who rely on them to build safe and secure software.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre not resting on our laurels, though: the Go contributors are continuing to develop and improve the cryptography libraries we provide users.</p>
<p>Go 1.24 now includes a FIPS 140-3 mode written in pure Go, which is currently undergoing CMVP testing. This will provide a supported FIPS 140-3 compliant mode for all users of Go, replacing the currently unsupported Go+BoringCrypto integration.</p>
<p>We are also working to implement modern post-quantum cryptography, introducing a ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 implementation in Go 1.24 in the <a href="/pkg/crypto/mlkem">crypto/mlkem package</a>, and adding support to the crypto/tls package for the hybrid X25519MLKEM768 key exchange.</p>
<p>Finally, we are planning on introducing new easier to use high-level cryptography APIs, designed to reduce the barrier for picking and using high-quality algorithms for basic use cases. We plan to begin with offering a simple password hashing API that removes the need for users to decide which of the myriad of possible algorithms they should be relying on, with mechanisms to automatically migrate to newer algorithms as the state-of-the-art changes.</p>

Now working with the new runes mode enabled by default. * <strong>shadcn-svelte:</strong> The unofficial, community-led Svelte port of shadcn/ui, the most loved and beautiful non-opinionated UI components library for Svelte.</p> <p>üöÄ <strong>What&#39;s New in v2.0?</strong> I&#39;ve made some significant updates based on feedback and to keep things modern:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Leaner Frontend:</strong> We dediced to replaced SvelteKit with Svelte for a more focused frontend architecture as we don&#39;t even need most of the metaframework features, so to keep things simple and save some space we&#39;re basing it on Svelte 5 only.</li> <li> <strong>Tailwind CSS 4.0:</strong> We upgraded to the latest Tailwind version (thx to shadcn-svelte :3).</li> <li> <strong>Modularized Tauri Commands:</strong> Refactored Tauri commands for better organization and enhanced error handling (we are going for a more &quot;taury&quot; way as you can see in <a href="https://tauri.app/develop/calling-rust/#error-handling">https://tauri.app/develop/calling-rust/#error-handling</a>) on the Rust side.</li> <li> <strong>New HelloWorld:</strong> We refactored the basic example into a separated component. Now it is even fancier ;D.</li> <li> <strong>Updated Dependencies:</strong> All project dependencies have been brought up to their latest suported versions. We ensure you this will not introduce any break.</li> <li> <strong>We are back to NVM:</strong> Switched to NVM (though Bun is still can be used for package management if whish). Our old pal NVM is just enough. Tauri doesn&#39;t include the Nodejs runtime in the bundle so we where are not getting the full benefits of Bunjs so we choose to default to NVM. We updated worflows to match the package manager for you.</li> </ul> <p>üîß <strong>Getting Started:</strong> It&#39;s pretty straightforward. You&#39;ll need Rust and Node.js (cargo &amp; npm).</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Use as a Template:</strong> Go to the repository and click &quot;Use this template&quot;.</li> <li> Clone your new repository: <code> git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME </code></li> <li> Install dependencies: <code> npm i </code></li> <li> Run the development server: <code> npm run tauri dev </code></li> </ol> <p>And you&#39;re all set!</p> <p>This project started as a simple boilerplate I put together for my own use, and I&#39;m thrilled to see it evolve.</p> <p>If you find this template helpful, consider giving it a ‚≠êÔ∏è on GitHub!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A couple weeks ago I added support for using units library, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shrewnit">Shrewnit</a>, in compile time with 100% stable Rust. For more information on how to use Shrewnit in and out of const, visit the <a href="https://docs.rs/shrewnit/latest/shrewnit/">docs</a>.</p> <pre><code>// Non-const code: let time = 1.0 * Seconds; let distance = 2.0 * Meters; let velocity = distance / time; // Const equivalent const TIME: Time = Seconds::ONE; const DISTANCE: Length = &lt;Meters as One&lt;f64, _&gt;&gt;::ONE.mul_scalar(2.0); const VELOCITY: LinearVelocity = DISTANCE.div_time(TIME); </code></pre> <p>While the same level of ergonomics isn&#39;t possible in const, you can get quite close.</p> <p>One of the main limitations of stable compile time Rust is the fact that trait methods cannot be called in const code. This means that types with a custom <code>Add</code> implementation can&#39;t be added in a const context.</p> <p>The workaround for this is to implement every const operation on units individually in terms of the types that support const math operations (integer and float primitives). This solution requires a huge number of implemenations doing the same operation, but luckily Shrewnit helps you by implementing everything with declarative macros automatically.</p> <pre><code>/// Automatically implements all operations, including with other dimensions, with const alternatives. shrewnit::dimension!( pub MyCustomDimension { canonical: MyCanonicalUnit, MyCanonicalUnit: 1.0 per canonical, MyDoubleUnit: per 2.0 canonical, } where { Self / SomeOtherDimension =&gt; ACompletelyDifferentDimension in SomeUnit, } ); </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/madewrongsoup"> /u/madewrongsoup </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqsvok/a_compile_time_units_library_shrewnit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqsvok/a_compile_time_units_library_shrewnit/">[comments]</a></span></div>

And, of course,</em> <a href="https://github.com/tliron/rust-kutil">the code</a>.</p> <p>+++</p> <p>Though you can rely on an external caching solution instead (e.g. a reverse proxy), there are good reasons to integrate the cache directly into your application. For one, direct access allows for an in-process in-memory cache, which is optimal for at least the first caching tier.</p> <p>When both caching and encoding are enabled it will avoid unnecessary reencoding by storing encoded versions in the cache. A cache hit will thus be able to handle HTTP content negotiation (the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header) instead of the upstream. This is an important compute optimization that is impossible to achieve if encoding and caching are implemented as independent layers. Far too many web servers ignore this optimization and waste compute resources reencoding data that has not changed.</p> <p>This layer also participates in client-side caching (conditional HTTP). A cache hit will respect the client&#39;s <code>If-None-Match</code> and <code>If-Modified-Since</code> headers and return a 304 (Not Modified) when appropriate, saving bandwidth as well as compute resources. If you don&#39;t set a <code>Last-Modified</code> header yourself then this layer will default to the instant in which the cache entry was created.</p> <p>For encoding we support the web&#39;s common compression formats: Brotli, Deflate, GZip, and Zstandard. We select the best encoding according to our and the client&#39;s preferences (HTTP content negotiation).</p> <p>The cache and cache key implementations are provided as generic type parameters. The [CommonCacheKey] implementation should suffice for common use cases.</p> <p>Access to the cache is <code>async</code>, though note that concurrent performance will depend on the actual cache implementation, the HTTP server, and of course your async runtime.</p> <p>Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/tliron/rust-kutil/tree/main/crates/http/examples">included examples</a>!</p> <h1>Status</h1> <p>Phew, this was a lot of delicate work.

I&#39;m posting here in the hope that folk can provide feedback, help test (especially in real-world scenarios), and possibly even (gasp!) join in the development.</p> <p>Code is here: <a href="https://github.com/tliron/rust-kutil">https://github.com/tliron/rust-kutil</a></p> <p>Note that the kutil-http library has various other HTTP utilities you might find useful, e.g. parsing common headers, reading request/response bodies into bytes (async), etc.</p> <p>Though this middleware is written for Tower, most of the code is general for the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/http">http crate</a>, so it should be relatively easy to port it to other Rust HTTP frameworks. I would happily accept contributions of such. I&#39;ve separated as much of the code from the Tower implementation as I could.</p> <p>Also, since this is Tower middleware it <em>should</em> work with any Tower-compatible project. However, I have only tested with axum (and also provide some axum-specific convenience functions). I would love to know if it can work in other Tower environments, too.</p> <p>I&#39;ll also ever-so-humbly suggest that my code is more readable than that in <a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http">tower-http</a>. ;)</p> <h1>TODO</h1> <p>Currently it only has a <a href="https://github.com/moka-rs/moka">moka</a> (async) cache implementation. But obviously it needs to support commonly used distributed caches, especially for tiers beyond the first.</p> <h1>Requirements</h1> <p>The response body type <em>and</em> its data type must both implement [From]&lt;Bytes&gt;. (This is supported by <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">axum</a>.) Note that even though <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio">Tokio</a> I/O types are used internally, this layer does <em>not</em> require a specific async runtime.</p> <h1>Usage notes</h1> <ol> <li>By default this layer is &quot;opt-out&quot; for caching and encoding. You can &quot;punch through&quot; this behavior via custom response headers (which will be removed before sending the response downstream): <ul> <li>Set <code>XX-Cache</code> to &quot;false&quot; to skip caching.</li> <li>Set <code>XX-Encode</code> to &quot;false&quot; to skip encoding.</li> </ul></li> <li>However, you can also configure for &quot;opt-in&quot;, <em>requiring</em> these headers to be set to &quot;true&quot; in order to enable the features. See cacheable_by_default and encodable_by_default.</li> <li>Alternatively, you can provide cacheable_by_request, cacheable_by_response, encodable_by_request, and/or encodable_by_response hooks to control these features. (If not provided they are assumed to return true.) The response hooks can be workarounds for when you can&#39;t add custom headers upstream.</li> <li>You can explicitly set the cache duration for a response via a <code>XX-Cache-Duration</code> header. Its string value is parsed using <a href="https://github.com/baoyachi/duration-str">duration-str</a>. You can also provide a cache_duration hook (the <code>XX-Cache-Duration</code> header will override it). The actual effect of the duration depends on the cache implementation.(<a href="https://docs.rs/moka/latest/moka/policy/trait.Expiry.html#method.expire_after_create">Here</a> is the logic used for the Moka implementation.)</li> <li>Though this layer transparently handles HTTP content negotiation for <code>Accept-Encoding</code>, for which the underlying content is the same, it cannot do so for <code>Accept</code> and <code>Accept-Language</code>, for which content can differ. We do, however, provide a solution for situations in which negotiation can be handled <em>without</em> the upstream response: the cache_key hook. Here you can handle negotiation yourself and update the cache key accordingly, so that different content will be cached separately. [CommonCacheKey] reserves fields for media type and languages, just for this purpose.If this impossible or too cumbersome, the alternative to content negotiation is to make content selection the client&#39;s responsibility by including the content type in the URL, in the path itself or as a query parameter. Web browsers often rely on JavaScript to automate this for users by switching to the appropriate URL, for example adding &quot;/en&quot; to the path to select English.</li> </ol> <h1>General advice</h1> <ol> <li>Compressing already-compressed content is almost always a waste of compute for both the server and the client. For this reason it&#39;s a good idea to explicitly skip the encoding of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types/Common_types">MIME types</a> that are known to be already-compressed, such as those for audio, video, and images. You can do this via the encodable_by_response hook mentioned above. (See the example.)</li> <li>We advise setting the <code>Content-Length</code> header on your responses whenever possible as it allows this layer to check for cacheability without having to read the body, and it&#39;s generally a good practice that helps many HTTP components to run optimally. That said, this layer will optimize as much as it can even when <code>Content-Length</code> is not available, reading only as many bytes as necessary to determine if the response is cacheable and then &quot;pushing back&quot; those bytes (zero-copy) if it decides to skip the cache and send the response downstream.</li> <li>Make use of client-side caching by setting the <code>Last-Modified</code> and/or <code>ETag</code> headers on your responses. They are of course great without server-side caching, but this layer will respect them even for cached entries, returning 304 (Not Modified) when appropriate.</li> <li>This caching layer does <em>not</em> own the cache, meaning that you can can insert or invalidate cache entries according to application events other than user requests. Example scenarios: <ol> <li>Inserting cache entries manually can be critical for avoiding &quot;cold cache&quot; performance degradation (as well as outright failure) for busy, resource-heavy servers. You might want to initialize your cache with popular entries before opening your server to requests. If your cache is distributed it might also mean syncing the cache first.</li> <li>Invalidating cache entries manually can be critical for ensuring that clients don&#39;t see out-of-date data, especially when your cache durations are long. For example, when certain data is deleted from your database you can make sure to invalidate all cache entries that depend on that data. To simplify this, you can the data IDs to your cache keys. When invalidating, you can then enumerate all existing keys that contain the relevant ID. [CommonCacheKey] reserves an <code>extensions</code> fields just for this purpose.</li> </ol></li> </ol> <h1>Request handling</h1> <p>Here we&#39;ll go over the complete processing flow in detail:</p> <ol> <li>A request arrives. Check if it is cacheable (for now). Reasons it won&#39;t be cacheable: <ul> <li>Caching is disabled for this layer</li> <li>The request is non-idempotent (e.g. POST)</li> <li>If we pass the checks above then we give the cacheable_by_request hook a chance to skip caching. If it returns false then we are non-cacheable.</li> </ul></li> <li>If the response is non-cacheable then go to &quot;Non-cached request handling&quot; below.</li> <li>Check if we have a cached response.</li> <li>If we do, then: <ol> <li>Select the best encoding according to our configured preferences and the priorities specified in the request&#39;s <code>Accept-Encoding</code>. If the cached response has <code>XX-Encode</code> header as &quot;false&quot; then use Identity encoding.</li> <li>If we have that encoding in the cache then: <ol> <li>If the client sent <code>If-Modified-Since</code> then compare with our cached <code>Last-Modified</code>, and if not modified then send a 304 (Not Modified) status (conditional HTTP). END.</li> <li>Otherwise create a response from the cache entry and send it. Note that we know its size so we set <code>Content-Length</code> accordingly. END.</li> </ol></li> <li>Otherwise, if we don&#39;t have the encoding in the cache then check to see if the cache entry has <code>XX-Encode</code> entry as &quot;false&quot;. If so, we will choose Identity encoding and go up to step 3.2.2.</li> <li>Find the best starting point from the encodings we already have. We select them in order from cheapest to decode (Identity) to the most expensive.</li> <li>If the starting point encoding is <em>not</em> Identity then we must first decode it. If <code>keep_identity_encoding</code> is true then we will store the decoded data in the cache so that we can skip this step in the future (the trade-off is taking up more room in the cache).</li> <li>Encode the body and store it in the cache.</li> <li>Go up to step 3.2.2.</li> </ol></li> <li>If we don&#39;t have a cached response: <ol> <li>Get the upstream response and check if it is cacheable. Reasons it won&#39;t be cacheable: <ul> <li>Its status code is not &quot;success&quot; (200 to 299)</li> <li>Its <code>XX-Cache</code> header is &quot;false&quot;</li> <li>It has a <code>Content-Range</code> header (we don&#39;t cache partial responses)</li> <li>It has a <code>Content-Length</code> header that is lower than our configured minimum or higher than our configured maximum</li> <li>If we pass all the checks above then we give the cacheable_by_response hook one last chance to skip caching. If it returns false then we are non-cacheable.</li> </ul></li> <li>If the upstream response is non-cacheable then go to &quot;Non-cached request handling&quot; below.</li> <li>Otherwise select the best encoding according to our configured preferences and the priorities specified in the request&#39;s <code>Accept-Encoding</code>. If the upstream response has <code>XX-Encode</code> header as &quot;false&quot; or has <code>Content-Length</code> smaller than our configured minimum, then use Identity encoding.</li> <li>If the selected encoding is not Identity then we give the encodable_by_response hook one last chance to skip encoding. If it returns false we set the encoding to Identity and add the <code>XX-Encode</code> header as &quot;true&quot; for use by step 3.1 above.</li> <li>Read the upstream response body into a buffer. If there is no <code>Content-Length</code> header then make sure to read no more than our configured maximum size.</li> <li>If there&#39;s still more data left or the data that was read is less than our configured minimum size then it means the upstream response is non-cacheable, so: <ol> <li>Push the data that we read back into the front of the upstream response body.</li> <li>Go to &quot;Non-cached request handling&quot; step 4 below.</li> </ol></li> <li>Otherwise store the read bytes in the cache, encoding them if necessary. We know the size, so we can check if it&#39;s smaller than the configured minimum for encoding, in which case we use Identity encoding. We also make sure to set the cached <code>Last-Modified</code> header to the current time if the header wasn&#39;t already set. Go up to step 3.2.Note that upstream response trailers are discarded and <em>not</em> stored in the cache. (We make the assumption that trailers are only relevant to &quot;real&quot; responses.)</li> </ol></li> </ol> <h1>Non-cached request handling</h1> <ol> <li>If the upstream response has <code>XX-Encode</code> header as &quot;false&quot; or has <code>Content-Length</code> smaller than our configured minimum, then pass it through as is. THE END.Note that without <code>Content-Length</code> there is no way for us to check against the minimum and so we must continue.</li> <li>Select the best encoding according to our configured preferences and the priorities specified in the request&#39;s <code>Accept-Encoding</code>.</li> <li>If the selected encoding is not Identity then we give the encodable_by_request and encodable_by_response hooks one last chance to skip encoding. If either returns false we set the encoding to Identity.</li> <li>If the upstream response is already in the selected encoding then pass it through. END.</li> <li>Otherwise, if the upstream response is Identity, then wrap it in an encoder and send it downstream. Note that we do not know the encoded size in advance so we make sure there is no <code>Content-Length</code> header. END.</li> <li>However, if the upstream response is <em>not</em> Identity, then just pass it through as is. END.Note that this is technically wrong and in fact there is no guarantee here that the client would support the upstream response&#39;s encoding. However, we implement it this way because: <ol> <li>This is likely a rare case. If you are using this middleware then you probably don&#39;t have already-encoded data coming from previous layers.</li> <li>If you do have already-encoded data, it is reasonable to expect that the encoding was selected according to the request&#39;s <code>Accept-Encoding</code>.</li> <li>It&#39;s quite a waste of compute to decode and then reencode, which goes against the goals of this middleware. (We do emit a warning in the logs.)</li> </ol></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emblemparade"> /u/emblemparade </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqsuso/integrated_http_caching_compression_middleware/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqsuso/integrated_http_caching_compression_middleware/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Forging the Future: My Ten-Year Journey Growing with Rust</h1> <p>Hello everyone, I am Zhang HandongÔºàAlex ZhangÔºâ, an independent consultant and technical writer. I have been in the Rust community for ten years, and on the occasion of Rust&#39;s tenth anniversary, I want to write down my story. It may not be that extraordinary, but these ten years are where I come from today.</p> <p>Looking back on this journey, I see not just the evolution of a programming language, but the growth of a passionate community from nothing to something, from small to large. During these ten years, I experienced the transformation from a learner to an evangelist, and witnessed the entire process of Rust in China evolving from a niche language to gradual adoption by mainstream enterprises. This is a story about learning, sharing, challenges, and growth, and also a microcosm of Chinese developers participating in the global open source community.</p> <blockquote> <p>In fact, I&#39;ve experienced many people and events related to Rust over these ten years that cannot be contained in this short article. Perhaps you will see some content worth writing about in my new book.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let me start from 2015.</p> <h2>First Encounter with Rust: The Turning Point of 2015</h2> <p>In 2015, I began to explore the Rust programming language, which had just released version 1.0.</p> <p>Actually, before 2015, I had been using dynamic languages for application development, coinciding with the previous &quot;startup wave.&quot; But by 2015, I felt personally exhausted with application development because applications changed too quickly, so I wanted to explore lower-level systems. I had this idea for a long time, but because I didn&#39;t particularly like C/C++, I never took action. After Rust released version 1.0 in 2015, I began learning Rust.</p> <p>As an engineer with many years of software development experience, I was attracted to Rust&#39;s design philosophy: memory safety without garbage collection, concurrency without data races, and zero-cost abstractions. My experience working in e-commerce, social gaming, advertising, and crowdfunding made me deeply aware of the limitations of traditional languages in large-scale system development, while Rust&#39;s future-oriented design appealed to me. At that time, I believed that Rust would be the last programming language I would need to learn in my lifetime.</p> <p>However, the learning process for Rust was full of challenges. I once considered giving up, but my character of enjoying challenges pushed me to persist. And it was precisely these seemingly difficult learning curves that solidified my knowledge foundation in lower-level systems.</p> <p><strong>I have always believed that it was Rust that reignited my passion for programming.</strong></p> <h2>The Evangelism Path: From Daily Reports to Writing Books</h2> <p>In January 2018, I created &quot;Rust Daily,&quot; compiling the latest developments in the Rust ecosystem every day. At that time, resources about Rust in Chinese were extremely limited. I hoped that through daily reports, I could lower the barrier for Chinese developers to access information about Rust. To my surprise, this small initiative received an enthusiastic response from the community and continues to this day.</p> <h3>The Birth and Impact of &quot;The Way of Rust Programming&quot;</h3> <p>In January 2019, my book &quot;The Way of Rust Programming&quot; was officially published. Reflecting on the original intention of writing, it actually stemmed from my understanding of learning itself. Rust is known for its steep learning curve, but in my view, this is precisely a valuable growth opportunity, not an obstacle. I didn&#39;t see it as a bad thing; I am the type of person who likes to challenge difficulties. A high learning curve indicated gaps in my knowledge system, and challenging the Rust language was an excellent opportunity for me to supplement my foundational knowledge of computer systems.</p> <p>Rust learning materials on the market were very limited at that time. The official &quot;The Rust Programming Language,&quot; while comprehensively introducing the syntax, failed to help readers clarify Rust&#39;s knowledge system. I had to resort to C++ and Haskell materials to assist my learning (because Rust borrowed many features from these two languages). As my understanding of Rust deepened, the idea of writing a systematic Rust guide gradually took shape.</p> <p>On one hand, I firmly believe that &quot;writing is the best way of thinking,&quot; and through writing, I could systematically organize my understanding of Rust; on the other hand, I observed that the community indeed needed a book for advanced readers, providing those who had completed basic knowledge with a more systematic cognitive perspective.</p> <p>After &quot;The Way of Rust Programming&quot; was published, my influence in the Rust community significantly increased, and that same year I participated in RustAsiaCon to share and exchange ideas. However, as no one is perfect, errors in the book were gradually discovered by readers. In my GitHub errata repository, readers submitted more than 200 issues, and some even mocked: &quot;How can you read a book with more than 200 issues of errata?&quot;</p> <p>These criticisms once troubled me greatly, but later I realized that <strong>a book is essentially a form of communication</strong>. For me, <strong>writing a book is not about educating others, but about sharing my understanding while accepting feedback to promote my own growth</strong>. Through readers&#39; errata, I corrected some misconceptions about Rust, which is exactly the best feedback I hoped to see from writing the book.</p> <p>With fame came more attention and evaluation. For a period, I was overly concerned with others&#39; evaluations. When someone sarcastically called me the &quot;Father of Rust in China,&quot; I once fell into depression, almost falling into the &quot;self-verification trap.&quot; After reflection, I finally understood: <strong>regardless of how others evaluate me, I only need to focus on doing my best</strong>.</p> <h2>Community Building: Connecting China with the World</h2> <p>In 2020, despite the challenges of the global pandemic, my teammates and I organized the first RustChinaConf in Shenzhen. As one of the initiators of the conference, seeing hundreds of Rust enthusiasts gather together to passionately discuss technical topics made me incredibly proud. That same year, I released &quot;Zhang Handong&#39;s Rust Practical Course&quot; on GeekTime, hoping to help more developers systematically learn Rust through online education.</p> <h3>The Founding and Reflection of &quot;Rust Magazine&quot;</h3> <p>In 2021, the successful hosting of RustChinaConf showed me the vibrant vitality of the Chinese Rust community and gave me more confidence to promote community development. I decided to found &quot;Rust Magazine,&quot; hoping that through a systematic publication, Chinese companies adopting Rust could better present their practical experiences to the public while providing a continuous learning platform for the community.</p> <p>That year, I also established the &quot;Rust Chinese Community&quot; on Feishu and regularly organized online salon activities. These platforms not only provided learning resources for developers but also facilitated connections between many Rust startups and talents. I was also fortunate to participate in Alibaba DAMO Academy&#39;s Feitian School to share Rust concepts, bringing Rust philosophy into large technology companies.</p> <p>Unfortunately, &quot;Rust Magazine&quot; ceased publication after persisting for a year. Reflecting on this experience, I believe it may have been because Rust&#39;s industrial adoption in China had not yet reached a critical point, and the pressure of content creation and maintenance was substantial. Nevertheless, I still believe this was a valuable attempt, and perhaps by 2026, with the further popularization of Rust in China, we can restart this project.</p> <p>In 2022, due to the pandemic, RustChinaConf was held online. That same year, I open-sourced the &quot;Rust Coding Guidelines&quot; project, hoping to provide a coding standard blueprint for Chinese companies adopting Rust.</p> <h3>Industrial Adoption: From Theory to Practice</h3> <p>Reflecting on my experiences in community evangelism, RustChinaConf conferences, and providing Rust consulting services to different enterprises, I found a clear pattern: <strong>Rust adoption in China shows distinct phases</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have successfully provided Rust consulting and internal training for these enterprises: Huawei / ZTE / Ping An Technology / Zhongtai Securities / Li Auto / Pengcheng Laboratory.</p> </blockquote> <p>2015-2018 was the exploration period, when everyone was full of hope for the Rust language but also had many concerns. However, domestic New SQL database pioneer PingCAP and ByteDance&#39;s Feishu team were among the earliest &quot;early adopters.&quot;</p> <p>2019-2022 was the expansion period, with telecommunications giants like Huawei/ZTE beginning to prepare for large-scale adoption of Rust. Huawei piloted Rust adoption in multiple areas, even making it one of the important development languages for the HarmonyOS operating system. During this phase, Rust was mainly applied in system programming, device drivers, and network services. And in 2021, Huawei joined the Rust Foundation as a founding board member. Tsinghua University&#39;s Rust OS Training Camp also began to launch.</p> <p>2022 to the present is the explosive period. ByteDance also began to gradually expand Rust internally, not just in Feishu but also in infrastructure, and by 2024, TikTok was also using Rust. By 2024, Huawei had designated Rust as the company&#39;s seventh main language. Ant Group also began using Rust to write a trusted OS, with the goal of replacing Linux. Many infrastructure startup teams, from embedded systems to databases, from physics engines to GUI to apps, have companies and teams using Rust.</p> <h3>Open Source Contributions: Connecting Technology and Community</h3> <p>In recent years, I have gradually shifted my focus to open source project development and contributions. Participating in the development of the Robius framework (a pure Rust App development framework targeting Flutter), Moxin (a large model client based on Rust), and other projects has given me the opportunity to apply Rust to cutting-edge technology fields.</p> <p>In 2023 and 2024, I participated in hosting the GOSIM Rust Workshop and GOSIM China Rust Track. GOSIM invited Rust officials and experts from well-known open source projects abroad to come to China to share. These international exchange activities not only enhanced China&#39;s influence in the global Rust community but also provided Chinese developers with opportunities for face-to-face exchanges with top international Rust experts.</p> <p><strong>This September, in Hangzhou, GOSIM will join with RustChinaConf 2025 and RustGlobal (the Rust Foundation&#39;s conference brand) to build a Rust exchange platform for domestic and international Rust developers.</strong></p> <p>In 2025, I collaborated with Tsinghua OS Training Camp to launch the &quot;Rust Open Training Camp,&quot; which received event sponsorship from the Rust Foundation. This project aims to cultivate Rust talents with system programming capabilities, filling the talent gap in this field in China. The first training camp was successfully held, with registrations reaching 2,000 people.</p> <h2>Future Outlook: Continuing to Expand the Scale of Domestic Rust Developers</h2> <p>Looking back on this ten-year journey with Rust, I feel deeply honored to have witnessed and participated in the development of Rust in China. From an initially niche language to its gradual application in cutting-edge fields such as systems programming, cloud native, AI, and blockchain, Rust&#39;s growth trajectory is exciting.</p> <p>As a Rust evangelist, my greatest sense of achievement comes not from personal technical progress, but from seeing more and more Chinese developers join the Rust community, more and more Chinese enterprises adopt the Rust technology stack, and more and more Chinese faces appear in the global Rust community.</p> <p>In the future, I will continue to contribute to Rust technology promotion, community building, and talent cultivation, helping the continued development of Rust in China, and also looking forward to Chinese developers playing a greater role in the global Rust ecosystem.</p> <p>Ten years to forge a sword, the path of Rust is long. But I firmly believe that the best times are still ahead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChaosBoot"> /u/ChaosBoot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqmofg/forging_the_future_my_tenyear_journey_growing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kqmofg/forging_the_future_my_tenyear_journey_growing/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>Today, we&#39;re releasing vk-video, a library for hardware video decoding using Vulkan Video. We made it as a part of a larger project called smelter, but decided to release it as an open-source crate.</p> <p>The library integrates with wgpu, so you can decode video using the GPU&#39;s hardware decoder and then sample the decoded frame in a wgpu pipeline. A major advantage of vk-video is that only encoded video is transferred between the GPU and the CPU, the decoded video is only kept in GPU memory. This is important, because decoded video is huge (10GB for a minute of 1080p@60fps). Because of that, vk-video should be very fast for programs that want to decode video and show it on the screen.</p> <p>Right now, vk-video only supports decoding AVC (aka H.264 or MPEG 4 Part 10), but work on an AVC encoder is progressing very quickly. We also hope to add support for other codecs later on.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx"> /u/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/tree/master/vk-video">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kq9vq3/vkvideo_a_hardware_video_decoding_library_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Instead of creating fully modeled 3D characters, artists can use layered 2D artwork to simulate realistic movement, expressions, and gestures. This technology is widely used in games, virtual YouTubers (VTubers), interactive applications, and animated visual novels, as it provides an expressive yet cost-effective approach to character animation.</p> <h1>üîß My approach</h1> <p>To run Live2D, you need two components: the proprietary and irreplaceable Cubism Core (whose source is not publicly available), and the open-source Cubism SDK. Official implementations of the Cubism SDK are available for platforms such as Unity, but I wanted it to run with <a href="https://ebitengine.org/">Ebitengine</a>, a Golang-based 2D game engine. Therefore, I created a Golang version of the Cubism SDK.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also included an implementation of a renderer specifically for Ebitengine in the repository.

Errors can be silenced by setting <code>getoptlong.OptErr</code> to non-zero.</li> <li>The GNU and BSD implementations of getopt_long both set the value of <code>optopt</code> when <code>flag != NULL</code> to <code>val</code> and <code>0</code> respectively. <em>getopt_long.go</em> ONLY sets <code>optopt</code> when either an invalid option is encountered OR an option requires an argument and didn&#39;t receive one.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BChristieDev"> /u/BChristieDev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kqruu9/getopt_longgo_v100_go_option_parser_inspired_by/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kqruu9/getopt_longgo_v100_go_option_parser_inspired_by/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I would like to find something that can be used for compiled layers that is more accessible to composer-programmers (as in, people writing small programs for a piece, not big programs for a consumer end product) than the C SDK in Max, which is very grungy and full of foot guns and brutal low level memory management that can totally crash the host.</p> <p>Go is looking like a strong contender. Easy to learn, philospohically compatible to Scheme (minimal, functional, etc), good C interop, and tricolor GC. My question is about max pause times.</p> <p>In music (not audio plugins, but music making code), it&#39;s standard fare to be running with over 10ms of system buffering because audio generation is so spikey. So short, predictable GC times are really ok, so long as the composer-programmer (user of the system) can be fairly certain of what they will shake out to be. I have been reading online, but found various (perhaps conflicting?) articles, some old, and am trying to sort out what the current deal is for establishing max pause times.</p> <p>Is it possible and realistic for one to make small Go programs and be ensured (soft-realtime ensured) that pause times can be &lt;1ms? what about sub 0.5 ms? It is totally ok to pay memory costs for this use case, and reasonable to pay some CPU (ie 25%, leaving 75% of compiled Go is still going to be plenty fast overall).</p> <p>Also, can users influence when the GC runs? I can do that in s7 Scheme, which helps as there are busy and not busy times in a music context (downbeats- busy, between beats, not busy)</p> <p>Pointers to any resources or stories, tips on using Go for low-latency soft realtime much appreciated.</p> <p>thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tremendous-machine"> /u/tremendous-machine </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kqoutv/max_stw_pause_times_these_days/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kqoutv/max_stw_pause_times_these_days/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Anyone that&#39;s interested in GameDev or lurking in GameDev/IndieDev related subreddits has seen these posts: <em>&quot;I spent 5 years on my game but I only have 200 wishlists! What did I do wrong?&quot;</em> </p> <p>You open the steam page, curious to take a look, and you see bad capsule art, screenshots/gifs with weak programmer art, and a poorly written product page with typos or grammar issues. The game is also a puzzle platformer or a metroidvania with no unique hook.</p> <p>I&#39;ve lost count of the number of threads like these I&#39;ve seen in this sub. They often get 1 or 2 comments, downvoted to zero, and disappear into the abyss.</p> <p>In an effort to offer something useful to the community for every time I&#39;ve seen a thread like this, looked, and then scrolled past it without engaging, here&#39;s a metaphor that might help. I have no credentials to my name to make this advice carry any weight, but hopefully the advice checks out as &quot;common sense&quot; like I think it does.</p> <p><strong>Selling your indie game is like selling your work at a craft fair.</strong></p> <ol> <li>The time investment spent on a product doesn&#39;t matter to the customer. Nobody at a craft fair cares how long it took you to make your shit. Whether it&#39;s pottery, wood furniture, or a wall painting, the only thing the customer cares about is, &quot;do I like the product and is it worth my time and money?&quot; You are not owed a return on your time investment. If someone at a craft fair spends 3 years making a shitty wooden chair out of 2x4s (construction lumber) and it looks like an 8 year old built it, the chair isn&#39;t going to sell. The amount of time they spent building the chair doesn&#39;t matter.</li> <li>Presentation matters. People walking around the craft fair are looking to spend money, but there are 500 other stands just like yours, and they only have so much time to spend browsing and a finite amount of money to spend on purchases. They&#39;re going to shop at places that look appealing and offer something within the niche they&#39;re looking for. If you&#39;re sitting at an empty white folding table with no tablecloth and a shitty hand drawn sign, folks are more likely to skip your offerings and spend time elsewhere, even if the actual product is nice.</li> <li>Visibility (marketing) matters. If your shop is buried in the farthest corner of the craft fair with minimal foot traffic, people aren&#39;t going to find you. There are 500 other shops that are just as appealing as yours, if not moreso. You have to do some leg work beforehand so people know you exist.</li> <li>Product quality matters. Look, if I can walk up to a shop and buy a beautiful coffee mug for $20 that will get years of use, why would I buy a coffee mug that looks like it&#39;s made by a toddler? Yeah, there are coffee mug collectors that might buy hundreds of them, and a few people might like what you&#39;ve made. But if you want to have widespread appeal you need to make something that&#39;s unique and has artistic vision while still keeping the quality bar high.</li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s a harsh reality. But it <em>is</em> reality. You aren&#39;t owed anything for your creative investments. Make something that you&#39;re proud of first and foremost. But if you really want it to sell at the craft fair, start thinking about your <em>stand/store/shop</em> and what it looks like to your potential customers<em>.</em> People at the craft fair want to spend money on nifty things that they like. Put yourself in their shoes and keep your quality bar high. And stop telling them how long it took you to make.</p> <p>Hopefully this metaphor helps reframe some things and thinking about things from a different perspective helps someone recognize where they have some weak points. If anyone else has advice along similar lines, I&#39;d love to hear it. Cheers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brother_bean"> /u/brother_bean </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqp1zu/a_metaphor_to_help_you_market_your_indie_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqp1zu/a_metaphor_to_help_you_market_your_indie_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there! </p> <p><em>Little preamble: this isn&#39;t meant to be a promotion of my services, I&#39;m genuinely curious!</em></p> <p>I&#39;m a recent college graduate with a bachelors degree in music composition, and I&#39;m looking to dip my toes in the video game music scene. I have absolutely no knowledge of what game development looks like, however, so I wanted to throw this question to a community that (I assume) does have that knowledge. </p> <p>I&#39;ve always assumed that it&#39;s somewhat midway into development; when there&#39;s a clear concept of what the game will be, but still early enough that things can be changed. </p> <p>And to what extent do game devs typically get their music folks involved in the development process? So far my only experience has been somewhat removed, with me simply writing a few tracks with the prerequisites that they could loop, but I imagine there&#39;s some studios or devs where the composer is basically a part of the dev team, right? </p> <p>Thanks for the insight!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RosesWolf"> /u/RosesWolf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqh0ty/composer_here_at_what_point_during_development_do/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqh0ty/composer_here_at_what_point_during_development_do/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi game devs! </p> <p>I&#39;m sending out an SOS as we are in a difficult situation. If someone knows how to make it better I&#39;d be sooo grateful! </p> <p>I work in a French indie video game studio. We created an account many years ago (in 2013) and we were not very active on Reddit, but this last month, we tried to contribute more and even created our own sub (we are the only moderator of the sub). Some gamers created other subs for our games and we have a community there. </p> <p>Last week, for an unknown reason, our sub was banned and our account suspended. We didn&#39;t receive any notice from Reddit, just a notification asking us to change our password for more safety. We did that and even changed our contact mail. We also sent an appeal but nothing changed. We talked to modsupport and reddithelp mods but they can&#39;t help us. </p> <p>We are very respectful of the communities, always contacting the mods before posting or commenting to be sure to follow the rules. So we don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on and we&#39;re willing to do whatever it takes to change that situation as it&#39;s very important for us to stay in touch with our game communities on Reddit.</p> <p>Did this situation happen to you or to some people you know? We don&#39;t really know what to do at that point, it&#39;s been almost 20 days now that we are banned. Thank you so much for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/smouick"> /u/smouick </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqfgik/indie_video_game_studio_with_suspended_account/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kqfgik/indie_video_game_studio_with_suspended_account/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, I really enjoy reading these post-mortems, so I figured I‚Äôd share mine.</p> <p>The Game: It‚Äôs a Metroidvania platformer called Super Roboy. You can check it out here: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756020/Super_Roboy/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1756020/Super_Roboy/</a></p> <p>What I Did:</p> <ul> <li>Ran a (modestly) successful Kickstarter ‚Äì raised ~$2,000 for marketing.</li> <li>Built a following on Reddit and Twitter.</li> <li>Hired a marketing guy.</li> <li>Set up a full marketing stack: website, mailing list, trailers, ads, etc.</li> <li>Got coverage: streamers played it and liked it, Gamerant gave it an 8/10, YouTubers made videos. Steam reviews are ‚ÄúVery Positive‚Äù (60+ reviews so far).</li> </ul> <p>The Numbers:</p> <p>-,Game price: $15 - 5 months post-launch: ~1,000 sales - Total revenue (after discounts, VAT, regional pricing, taxes, Steam‚Äôs cut, etc.): ~$3,000 - I bought a good laptop for gamedev and a pricey FL Studio plugin for music - What‚Äôs left: ~$1,000, which I used to treat myself to a Steam Deck</p> <p>So, was it a success?</p> <p>Financially? Not even close. Even with all the ‚Äúright‚Äù boxes checked‚ÄîKickstarter, streamers, good reviews, solid marketing‚Äîit made very little money.</p> <p>But personally? Absolutely.</p> <p>Around 1,000 people bought and loved my game. People told me they had a great time playing it. People made a fan wiki. There are walkthroughs. That blows my mind. I had an absolute blast making it and sharing it. Final Thoughts:</p> <p>I already make a solid living doing what I love (tattoo artist), so gamedev is a hobby for me, not something I depend on. That probably helps me stay positive about the outcome.</p> <p>End of the day: don‚Äôt expect anything crazy. You‚Äôre not special and neither is your game‚Äîjust like I‚Äôm not and mine isn‚Äôt.</p> <p>But making something, putting it out into the world, and seeing even a few people truly enjoy it? That‚Äôs so worth it.</p> <p>Have fun everyone, you‚Äôre all awesome!</p> <p>Edit 1: 3000 profit, not revenue.</p> <p>Edit 2: thanks everyone, I‚Äôm happy this post resonates with you, and I appreciate the feedback!</p> <p>Edit 3: Alright I understand this post sounds negative in some ways, like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not special and neither is your game‚Äù. But I‚Äôm super happy with the results, with the fact I made a game, and the reception, and I‚Äôm going to keep making games because I love it so much! And I‚Äôm not let down by the numbers, at all, or by the fact that I‚Äôm not special and neither is my game - this is a hobby and it‚Äôs so much fun! And just the fact we‚Äôre all making games is special in itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vincent_Penning"> /u/Vincent_Penning </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kq5vj3/post_mortem_my_game_is_a_financial_failure_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kq5vj3/post_mortem_my_game_is_a_financial_failure_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>
