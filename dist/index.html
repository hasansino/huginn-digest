            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some people might have noticed that the state in <code>example</code> crate in tessera-ui is quite... verbose? That‚Äôs actually because I deliberately avoided designing components like <code>button(&quot;id&quot;)</code> that rely on indexing state by ID in the context. I find that approach somewhat inelegant.</p> <p>In fact, I have a different perspective on how to solve this problem. I believe we should provide some kind of macro‚Äîsimilar to a viewmodel‚Äîthat injects a state into marked <code>tessera</code> function parameters. This state would have its lifetime promoted to the <code>renderer</code> level, allowing you to access its value reliably on each frame. It might look like this:</p> <p>```rust trait State { // idk for now }</p> <h1>[state]</h1> <h1>[tessera]</h1> <p>fn screen_1(state: impl State) { // use state for component } ```</p> <p>This essentially uses a macro to split the top-level state into multiple parts. I also envision that async support and routing could be elegantly integrated into this viewmodel-like structure.Pseudocode here:</p> <p>```rust // router?</p> <h1>[state]</h1> <h1>[tessera]</h1> <p>fn screen(state: impl State, router: RouteController) { use screen2::router_gen::Screen2Dest; // ... router.push(Screen2Dest); } ```</p> <p>```rust impl State for FooState { // impled... }</p> <p>impl FooState { async fn foo_async() {} pub fn foo() { self.async_task(foo_async()) // async_task fn inside trait <code>State</code> } } ```</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ExaminationFluid17"> /u/ExaminationFluid17 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m8n1of/something_like_view_model_in_tessera/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m8n1of/something_like_view_model_in_tessera/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Then I made another one that did the same thing but just interacted with a different part of the database. Didn&#39;t put too much thought into it, nothing too crazy just grouping together similar functionality.</p> <p>A couple days later I took a look at these structs and I saw that all they had in them was a PgPool. Nothing else - these structs were functionally identical. And they didn&#39;t need anything else - there was no data that needed to be shared between the grouping of these functions! Obviously these should have all been separate functions that took in a reference to the PgPool itself. </p> <p>I gotta break these old OOP habits.

The paper is a bit old, but the methods haven&#39;t changed much since then. I&#39;m new to Rust, and I come from a mostly-C background, and I am familiar with libmalloc&#39;s inner-workings. I thought Rust does not even allow dynamic allocation! Hence I was hesitant to dive into it. Until people here pointed out my mistake. I&#39;m interested to dive into Rust&#39;s source code and see how <code>alloc</code> function works. Whether it uses a method similar to libmalloc, or one of the methods mentioned in this paper. At the end of the day you need to make a systemcall to allocate (at least on Unix systems --- in bare-metal it&#39;s a whole other beast). On Linux it&#39;s either <code>mmap</code> or <code>brk</code>. But you need to &#39;manage&#39; these allocations, which libmalloc does via a linked list. You also need to mark your block boundaries with a sentinel. Another thing you must do in a dynamic allocation library is to make sure your blocks don&#39;t become fragmented. Only in some methods, though. This paper lays it all out in the open.</p> <p>Remember that I use the term &#39;blocks&#39; here. Not &#39;pages&#39;. A &#39;page&#39; belongs to the OS, as a part of the virtual memory, and on x86-64 it&#39;s managed by the MMU. In older Intel CPUs, &#39;segments&#39; did that. More about that on Intel manual volume 3. Blocks are a collection of pages that belong to the process.</p> <p>You can maybe use this paper to create your own memory allocation library in Rust. It could be good practice. Can you implement a dynamic allocation library that is entirely safe? That&#39;s another question I&#39;d like to find out about Rust.</p> <p>Have fun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Performance3280"> /u/Ok_Performance3280 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m8f5ep/a_good_paper_that_i_recommend_everyone_to_read_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m8f5ep/a_good_paper_that_i_recommend_everyone_to_read_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Rustaceans!</p> <p>I am excited to announce the release of <strong>tanu</strong> - High-performance WebAPI testing framework for Rust.</p> <p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/tanu-rs/tanu">tanu-rs/tanu</a></p> <h1>The Need for New API Testing framework</h1> <p>I&#39;ve been developing web backends in Rust since 2017. Modern Web APIs run on complex infrastructure today. With API Gateways like Envoy and CDN layers like AWS CloudFront, issues that unit tests and integration tests can&#39;t catch often emerge. End-to-end API testing in production-like environments is essential to catch.</p> <h1>My Journey Through Testing Solutions</h1> <p>Started with Postman in 2019 - great GUI but tests became unmanageable as complexity grew, plus I wanted to test my Rust APIs in Rust, not JavaScript. Moved to DIY solutions with Cargo + Tokio + Reqwest in 2021, which gave me the language consistency I wanted but required building everything from scratch. Tried Playwright in 2024 - excellent tool but created code duplication since I had to define schemas in both Rust and TypeScript. These experiences convinced me that Rust needed a dedicated, lightweight framework for Web API testing.</p> <h1>The Web API Testing Framework I&#39;m Building</h1> <p>I&#39;m currently developing a framework called <code>tanu</code>. </p> <p><a href="https://i.redd.it/ns2hz0xtytef1.gif">Running tests with tanu in TUI mode</a></p> <p><strong>Design Philosophy</strong></p> <p>For tanu&#39;s design, I prioritized:</p> <ul> <li>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Test Execution Runtime</strong>: I chose running tests on the tokio async runtime. While I considered extending cargo test (libtest) like <a href="https://nexte.st/">nextest</a>, running as tokio tasks seemed more flexible for parallel processing and retries than separating tests into binaries.</li> <li>üç£ <strong>Code Generation with Proc Macros</strong>: Using proc macros like <code>#[tanu::test]</code> and <code>#[tanu::main]</code>, I minimized boilerplate for writing tests.</li> <li>üîß <strong>Combining Rust Ecosystem&#39;s Good Parts</strong>: I combined and sometimes mimicked good parts of Rust&#39;s testing ecosystem like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/test-case">test-case</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pretty_assertions">pretty_assertions</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/reqwest">reqwest</a>, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/color-eyre">color-eyre</a> to make test writing easy for Rust developers.</li> <li>üñ•Ô∏è <strong>Multiple Interfaces</strong>: I designed it to run tests via CLI and TUI without complex code. GUI is under future consideration.</li> <li>üí° <strong>Inspiration from Playwright</strong>: I referenced Playwright&#39;s project<a href="https://github.com/tanu-rs/tanu/discussions/98#user-content-fn-2-f845b0f23085fc811e8da8115fee4e58"><sup>2</sup></a> concept while aiming for more flexible design. I want to support different variables per project (unsupported in Playwright) and switchable output like Playwright&#39;s reporters, plus plugin extensibility.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Installation &amp; Usage</strong></p> <pre><code>cargo new your-api-tests cd your-api-tests cargo add tanu cargo add tokio --features full </code></pre> <p><strong>Minimal Boilerplate</strong></p> <pre><code>#[tanu::main] #[tokio::main] async fn main() -&gt; tanu::eyre::Result&lt;()&gt; { let runner = run(); let app = tanu::App::new(); app.run(runner).await?; Ok(()) } </code></pre> <p><strong>Hello Tanu!</strong></p> <p>Simply annotate async functions with <code>#[tanu::test]</code> to recognize them as tests. <code>tanu::http::Client</code> is a thin wrapper around reqwest that collects test metrics behind the scenes while enabling easy HTTP requests with the same reqwest code.</p> <pre><code>use tanu::{check, eyre, http::Client}; #[tanu::test] async fn get() -&gt; eyre::Result&lt;()&gt; { let http = Client::new(); let res = http.get(&quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;).send().await?; check!(res.status().is_success()); Ok(()) } </code></pre> <p><strong>Parameterized Tests for Efficient Multiple Test Cases</strong></p> <pre><code>#[tanu::test(200)] #[tanu::test(404)] #[tanu::test(500)] async fn test_status_codes(expected_status: u16) -&gt; eyre::Result&lt;()&gt; { let client = Client::new(); let response = client .get(&amp;format!(&quot;https://httpbin.org/status/{expected_status}&quot;)) .send() .await?; check_eq!(expected_status, response.status().as_u16()); Ok(()) } </code></pre> <p><strong>Declarative Configuration</strong></p> <p>Test configurations (retry, variables, filters) can be described in TOML:</p> <pre><code>[[projects]] name = &quot;default&quot; # Project name test_ignore = [] # Test skip filters retry.count = 0 # Retry count retry.factor = 2.0 # Backoff factor retry.jitter = false # Enable jitter retry.min_delay = &quot;1s&quot; # Minimum delay retry.max_delay = &quot;60s&quot; # Maximum delay foo = &quot;bar&quot; # Project variables </code></pre> <p><strong>Project Feature for Multi-Environment Testing</strong></p> <p>Inspired by Playwright&#39;s Project concept, you can define multiple projects to run tests in different environments and configurations:</p> <pre><code>[[projects]] name = &quot;dev&quot; test_ignore = [] base_url = &quot;https://dev.example.com&quot; foo = &quot;bar&quot; [[projects]] name = &quot;staging&quot; test_ignore = [] base_url = &quot;https://staging.example.com&quot; foo = &quot;bar&quot; [[projects]] name = &quot;production&quot; test_ignore = [] base_url = &quot;https://production.example.com&quot; foo = &quot;bar&quot; </code></pre> <p><strong>Beautiful Backtraces</strong></p> <p>Uses color-eyre by default to beautifully display error backtraces with source code line numbers.</p> <p><strong>CLI Mode</strong></p> <p>Real-time test execution with detailed output and filtering options.</p> <p><strong>TUI Mode</strong></p> <p>Interactive TUI for real-time test result monitoring and detailed request/response inspection. Smooth and responsive interface.</p> <p><strong>Other</strong> <strong>Features</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Fine-grained test execution control</strong>: CLI test filtering and concurrency control</li> <li><strong>anyhow/std Result support</strong>: Error handling with eyre, anyhow, or standard Result</li> <li><strong>Reporter output control</strong>: Test results output in JSON, HTML, and other formats</li> <li><strong>Plugin extensibility</strong>: Third parties can develop Reporter plugins to extend tanu&#39;s output</li> <li><strong>Test Reporting (Allure Integration)</strong></li> </ul> <p>If you are interested, please visit:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/tanu-rs/tanu">Github repository</a></li> <li><a href="https://tanu-rs.github.io/hosted/">Tanu Guide</a></li> </ul> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yukinarit"> /u/yukinarit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m85z07/announcing_tanu_highperformance_webapi_testing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m85z07/announcing_tanu_highperformance_webapi_testing/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for some feedback on a tool I built called <strong>Softserve</strong> and whether it might be useful to a wider audience in the Go community.</p> <p>I originally developed Softserve for a front-end developer friend who was constantly struggling with his local development environment. His setup involved multiple Docker containers and various services, all managed by a script, and when things went wrong, he lacked the backend knowledge to fix them.</p> <p>My solution was Softserve, a single binary executable designed to simplify his front-end development workflow. Here&#39;s what it offers:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Auto-generated, In-memory SSL</strong> certificates.</li> <li><strong>Hot reloading</strong> on file changes</li> <li><strong>Configurable API mocks</strong>: This was a big one. His front end made about 8 API JSON calls, and Softserve allowed him to define configurable mocks for all of them. It injects scripts in real-time to intercept these API calls and provides hot reloading for the mocks themselves. This meant he could work entirely on the front end without needing the actual backend to be running.</li> <li><strong>Zero-touch integration</strong>: Softserve works with fully built static HTML files (flat or nested structures) and requires no modifications to the application&#39;s source code. All the necessary code for hot reloading and API interception is injected by Softserve at runtime.</li> </ul> <p>I know there are other tools that do similar things, but I thought this was a fun exercise in my current &quot;zero-touch&quot; addiction. ;) But I&#39;ve found myself using it for a few smaller projects--especially for quick front-end edits when I get an idea and only have me lightweight but under-powered laptop out at the bar.</p> <p>Just looking for feedback and to gauge any interest. I&#39;m not trying to make this a tool for everything, I&#39;d rather concentrate on making a bit more bulletproof. Plus, if there&#39;s any traction, it&#39;s a project I wouldn&#39;t mind maintaining.</p> <p>It just went through some drastic refactoring to use in-memory certs and get rid of the application yaml in favor of more portable command line args, but it should be in a working state!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/mwiater/softserve">https://github.com/mwiater/softserve</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/colonel_whitebeard"> /u/colonel_whitebeard </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8l13g/softserve_a_simple_local_server_for_static_web/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8l13g/softserve_a_simple_local_server_for_static_web/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It&#39;s essentially a dispatcher (all business logic is handled by your backend). You define your real-time logic (event routing, rooms, permissions) in a YAML file.</p> <p>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been working on this project for a while and was curious if anyone would find it useful. The goal is to have a plug-and-play realtime environment with little to no setup time.</p> <p>Problem: I was working on a personal project. It&#39;s small so I didn&#39;t really need a backend (server functions were enough) and was easily setup on vercel but I wanted to add a chat (and a few more realtime features). I looked up realtime services and the max free service is 100 connections. So my options were use pusher&#39;s 100 connections and selfhost with soketi in the future or rewrite my whole app and build a backend and selfhost from the get go.</p> <p>Solution: A realtime server that&#39;s independent from your app. It authenticates once at startups and uses tokens authorized by your backend for authorization. The WS server is configured with yaml. It doesn&#39;t do anything other than recieve and emit. The logic is handled by your app.</p> <p>I&#39;m just curious what you guys think of this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blakk23"> /u/blakk23 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8cy3g/building_a_configdriven_websocket_engine_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8cy3g/building_a_configdriven_websocket_engine_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>
