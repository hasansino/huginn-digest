            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I&#39;ve been building a terminal tool called <a href="https://github.com/zix99/rare">rare</a> on and off for the past few years to allow quickly searching and visualizing text files in the terminal (eg. log files) using various strategies like histograms, heatmaps, bar graphs, etc, in addition to simply searching for text.</p> <p>Over the course of doing this, I&#39;ve made detailed use of performance profiles and learned a ton about performance in golang. I won&#39;t detail all of them, but some of the largest impacts that are just so easy to miss:</p> <ul> <li>Output (stdout/stderr, fmt., etc) aren&#39;t buffered!! That&#39;s great for immediate results, but as soon as you want performance with output, it&#39;s a killer. A quick wrap in <code>bufio.NewWriter(os.Stdout)</code> saw performance increase 3-4x in my app. Such an easy win.</li> <li>Batch channels. Channels are great, but are relatively expensive. Rather than sending 1 matched piece of data at a time, send 1000. This not only reduces channel overhead, but keeps tight loops processing better and more effectively.</li> <li><code>sync.Pool</code> does optimizations that you can&#39;t do better with a Mutex (eg. has some runtime specific implementation). It&#39;s easy to write a pool, but in my case, slowed this down. That said, pooling re-used contexts or data can be a big advantage if frequently used and discarded</li> <li>Don&#39;t underestimate garbage collection, but don&#39;t over-estimate it either. GC is quite good, especially at small allocations. But you don&#39;t want to be doing tons of them if avoidable. Quite a bit of my optimization was refactoring to prevent large copies of data, and rather to use in-place slices to larger buffers as much as possible.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to these, and more, I&#39;m seeing clock-time <a href="https://rare.zdyn.net/benchmarks/">performance comparable to ripgrep</a>, though I suspect I&#39;ll never quite beat it in cpu-time because of the runtime overhead.</p> <p>Would love input from the community, thoughts, or other patterns you&#39;ve learned to optimize your applications!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zix99"> /u/zix99 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kt8dx2/i_built_a_tool_rare_to_build_terminal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kt8dx2/i_built_a_tool_rare_to_build_terminal/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Quite recently I wanted to add a git hook to show me a checklist before I push some changes to a certain branch at work. Stuff like &quot;have you actually tried to build the project after merging? Have you run the program? Have you followed the guidelines? Have you run the tests?&quot;.</p> <p>I could not find much online, didn&#39;t want to waste too much time on it and I also didn&#39;t want to research shell scripting and it&#39;s sometimes weird and not too intuitive syntax again, so I asked chatgpt to generate me a script. Testing it? Not too easy with git hooks, but I&#39;m going to see if it does what I want it to once the time comes. Aaaaaannnd syntax errors.</p> <p>That&#39;s it, there has to be an easier way. I mean, I can&#39;t believe some stuff like: a checklist before doing things like pushing or preparing a commit message using information from the branch can&#39;t be too uncommon. But nope, nothing there yet. Good thing I&#39;m a programmer who&#39;d rather spend 10 hours automating something than 5 seconds doing it by hand. So I&#39;ve tried to create something that satisfies a couple of points</p> <ul> <li><p>Easy to use: I don&#39;t want to write shell scripts all the time or manage them in a git repo and then remember to update them. Something like a setup script from which I can choose what I want would be amazing</p></li> <li><p>Powerful: if I&#39;m already spending time on this, might as well have a checklist that does more than print itself on the screen. how about an interactive terminal ui where I can check off the things I&#39;ve done!</p></li> <li><p>Easily extensible: I don&#39;t want to move the management burden from the setup to the development. If I want to add a feature it should be easy and quick.</p></li> <li><p>Configurable: I don&#39;t want to edit the code itself every time I&#39;m in a new project/at a new company and the hooks need to be slightly changed</p></li> </ul> <p>So I&#39;ve written <a href="https://github.com/Lofter1/githook-manager">githook manager</a>. A go program that sets up hooks, but also is the hooks! The setup command will guide you through the setup, letting you choose what hook you want and set its options. Then a shell script will be added as the git hook that calls the go program and executes the hook logic. Like: writing a beautiful, interactive checklist before pushing into certain branches onto the screen and stop the push if not everything has been checked.</p> <p>Right now, the functionality is pretty bare bones, just the checklist and a way to block pushing into certain branches, but I&#39;ve already planned to add a prepare-commit-message hook where I can take certain information from the branch name and put it into the commit message (like a ticket number for example). And I&#39;m very open to suggestions on what functionality I might want to add! The program is easily extensible, so that if a functionality is to be added, one can concentrate on actually writing the function instead of following steps to make sure the setup always prompts for the right stuff or things like that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lofter1"> /u/Lofter1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kt1yxl/ive_tried_to_make_git_hooks_easier_to_use_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kt1yxl/ive_tried_to_make_git_hooks_easier_to_use_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kstaj5/i_built_octelium_a_foss_unified_access_platform/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>, I&#39;ve been working solo on Octelium for quite some years now and I&#39;d love to get some honest opinions from you. Octelium is simply an open source, self-hosted, unified platform for zero trust resource access written in Golang that is primarily meant to be a modern alternative to corporate VPNs and remote access tools. It is built to be generic enough to not only operate as a zero-config remote access VPN (i.e. alternative to OpenVPN Access Server, Twingate, Tailscale, etc...), a ZTNA/BeyondCorp platform (i.e. alternative to Cloudflare Zero Trust, Google BeyondCorp, Zscaler Private Access, Teleport, etc...), a scalable infrastructure for secure tunnels (i.e. alternative to ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnels, etc...), but also can operate as an API gateway, an AI gateway, a secure infrastructure for MCP gateways and A2A architectures, a PaaS-like platform for secure as well as anonymous hosting and deployment for containerized applications, a Kubernetes gateway/ingress/load balancer and even as an infrastructure for your own homelab.</p> <p>Octelium basically provides a scalable zero trust architecture (ZTA) for identity-based, application-layer (L7) aware secret-less secure access (eliminating the distribution of L7 credentials such as API keys, SSH and database passwords as well as mTLS certs), via both private client-based access over WireGuard/QUIC tunnels as well as public clientless access, for users, both humans and workloads, to any private/internal resource behind NAT in any environment as well as to publicly protected resources such as SaaS APIs and databases via context-aware access control on a per-request basis through centralized policy-as-code with CEL and OPA.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to point out that this is not an MVP or a side project, I&#39;ve been actually working on this project solely for way too many years now. The current status of the project is public beta or simply v1.0 with bugs. The APIs, the architecture and almost all features have been stabilized. Basically the only thing that keeps it from being v1.0 is the lack of testing in production (for example, most of my own usage is on Linux machines and containers, as opposed to Windows or Mac) but hopefully that will improve soon. Secondly, Octelium is not a yet another crippled freemium product with an &quot;&quot;&quot;open source&quot;&quot;&quot; label that&#39;s designed to force you to buy a separate fully functional SaaS version of it. Octelium has no SaaS offerings nor does it require some paid cloud-based control plane. In other words, Octelium is truly meant for self-hosting. Finally, I am not backed by VC and so far this has been simply a one-man show.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/geoctl"> /u/geoctl </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/octelium/octelium">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kstaj5/i_built_octelium_a_foss_unified_access_platform/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><blockquote> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> ‚Äî Kubetail now has ‚ö° fast in-cluster search, 1,000+ stars, multi-cluster CLI flags, and an open roadmap; we‚Äôre looking for new contributors (especially designers).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kubetail</strong> is an open-source, general-purpose logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across multi-container workloads in real-time. The primary entry point for Kubetail is the <code>kubetail</code> CLI tool, which can launch a local web dashboard on your desktop or stream raw logs directly to your terminal. To install Kubetail, see the Quickstart instructions in our <a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail">README</a>.</p> <p>The communities here on Reddit (especially <a href="/r/kubernetes">r/kubernetes</a>, <a href="/r/devops">r/devops</a> and <a href="/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a>) have been so supportive over the last month and I‚Äôm truly grateful. I‚Äôm excited to share some of the updates that came as a result of that support.</p> <h1>What&#39;s new</h1> <h1>üåü Growth</h1> <p>Before posting to Reddit, we had 400 stars, a few intrepid users and one lead developer talking to himself in our Discord. Now we&#39;ve broken 1,000 stars, have new users coming in every day, and we have an awesome, growing community that loves to build together. We also just added a maintainer to the project who happens to be a Redditor and who first found out about us from our post last month (welcome <a href="https://github.com/rxinui">@rxinui</a>).</p> <p>Kubetail is a full-stack app (typescript/react, go, rust) which makes it a lot of fun to work on. If you want to sharpen your coding skills and contribute to a project that&#39;s helping Kubernetes users to monitor their cluster workloads in real-time, come join us. We&#39;re especially eager to find a designer who loves working on data intensive, user-facing GUIs. To start contributing, click on the Discord link in our README:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail">https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail</a></p> <h1>üîç Search</h1> <p>Last month we released a preview of our real-time log search tool and I&#39;m happy to say that it&#39;s now available to everyone in our latest official release. The search feature is powered by a custom rust binary that wraps the excellent <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> library which makes it incredibly fast. To enable log search in your Kubetail Dashboard, you have to install the &quot;Kubetail API&quot; in your cluster which can be done by running <code>kubetail cluster install</code> using our CLI tool. Once the API resources are running, search queries from the Dashboard are sent to agents running in your cluster which perform remote grep on your behalf and send back matching log records to your browser. Try out our live demo and let us know what you think!</p> <p><a href="https://www.kubetail.com/demo">https://www.kubetail.com/demo</a></p> <h1>üèéÔ∏è Roadmap</h1> <p>Recently we published our <a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap-and-status">official roadmap</a> so that everyone can see where we&#39;re at and where we&#39;re headed:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">-</th> <th align="left">Step</th> <th align="left">Status</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">1</td> <td align="left">Real-time container logs</td> <td align="left">‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">2</td> <td align="left">Real-time search and polished user experience</td> <td align="left">üõ†Ô∏è</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">3</td> <td align="left">Real-time system logs (e.g. systemd, k8s events)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">4</td> <td align="left">Basic customizability (e.g. colors, time formats)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">5</td> <td align="left">Message parsing and metrics</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">6</td> <td align="left">Historic data (e.g. log archives, metrics time series)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">7</td> <td align="left">Kubetail API and developer-facing client libraries</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">N</td> <td align="left">World Peace</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Of course, we&#39;d love to hear your feedback. Let us know what you think!</p> <h1>ü™Ñ Usability improvements</h1> <p>Since last month we&#39;ve made a lot of usability improvements to the Kubetail Dashboard. Now, both the workload viewer and the logging console have collapsible sidebars so you can dedicate more real estate to the main data pane (thanks <a href="https://github.com/harshcodesdev">@harshcodesdev</a>). We also added a search box to the workload viewer which makes it easy to find specific workloads when there are a large number to browse through (thanks <a href="https://github.com/victorchrollo14">@victorchrollo14</a>). Another neat change we made is that we removed an <code>EndpointSlices</code> requirement which means that now Kubetail works down past Kubernetes 1.17.</p> <h1>üíª Multi-cluster support in terminal</h1> <p>Recently we added two very useful features to the CLI tool that enable you to switch between multiple clusters easily. Now you can use the <code>--kubeconfig</code> and <code>--kube-context</code> flags when using the <code>kubetail logs</code> sub-command to set your kube config file and the context to use (thanks @rxinui). For example, this command will fetch all the logs for the &quot;web&quot; deployment in the &quot;my-context&quot; context defined in a custom location:</p> <pre><code>$ kubetail logs deployments/web \ --kubeconfig ~/.kube/my-config \ --kube-context my-context \ --since 2025-04-20T00:00:00Z \ --until 2025-04-21T00:00:00Z \ --all &gt; logs.txt </code></pre> <h1>What&#39;s next</h1> <p>Currently we&#39;re working on permissions-handling features that will allow Kubetail to be used in environments where users are only given access to certain namespaces. We&#39;re also working on enabling client-side search for users who don&#39;t need &quot;remote grep&quot;.</p> <p>We love hearing from you!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to share something I‚Äôve been working on, and to be honest, I could really use some help. I‚Äôm the person behind <a href="https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast">Gapcast</a>, a Wi-Fi penetration testing toolkit I‚Äôm developing in Go. The idea came from a simple frustration: I was tired of juggling airodump, aireplay, hostapd, and a dozen other tools every time I wanted to run a Wi-Fi test. So I decided to build something that brings everything together in one clean, unified interface.</p> <p>Right now, I‚Äôm in the middle of a complete rewrite ‚Äî which is both exciting and a bit terrifying. I‚Äôm rebuilding everything from the ground up to make it more modular and stable. But I‚Äôll be honest with you: working on this solo is getting pretty overwhelming. Having more people involved wouldn‚Äôt just speed up development and improve the tool, it would also give me the motivation to keep going and prevent this from becoming yet another dusty, abandoned project on GitHub.</p> <p>The current version already handles the usual suspects: interactive Wi-Fi scanning with detailed network analysis, beacon flooding on 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels, Evil Twin attacks with integrated captive portals for credential harvesting, multi-target automated deauth attacks with proper monitor mode management, and even a Wi-Fi radar feature that estimates device positions based on RSSI. I‚Äôve also created something I call the ‚ÄúInjection Table‚Äù ‚Äî an interface where you can launch different attacks with a single keystroke. Gapcast also supports NIC management with advanced settings and bug fixes, especially for Realtek/RTL chipsets. What really sets Gapcast apart is its ease of use and aggressive automation ‚Äî without hiding what it‚Äôs actually doing under the hood.</p> <p>What I‚Äôd really love is an extra pair of eyes on this project ‚Äî something that would motivate and encourage me to keep pushing forward with the rewrite and future features. If you&#39;re interested, Gapcast is also available through NixOS packages. Thanks for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ANDRVV_"> /u/ANDRVV_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ksn3pg/gapcast_a_80211_hacking_tool_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ksn3pg/gapcast_a_80211_hacking_tool_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. To keep the introduction short, I&#39;m currently a backend developer with around 3-4 years of experience in Java &amp; Python. I want to create a game. I don&#39;t plan on getting recognition or getting rich: I have a story I&#39;ve written for a while now and I want to share it with the world through a game and make my audience reflect on certain things and scare the shit out of them. I know getting there is far away in the future, but might start now as well with simple, small games (Pong, Tetris, tutorials). </p> <p>I&#39;m very, very confused about how I should start learning. Yes, I get it: I should start writing a way simple game or even trying to write a Pong or Tetris on my own (I read both <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051004074306/http://www.lupinegames.com/articles/path_to_dev.html">How do I Make Games?</a> and <a href="https://www.sloperama.com/advice/idea.htm">Game Design 101</a> from the wiki). <strong>But I don&#39;t know if I should start with Godot or with plain C++ or C#</strong> (which I&#39;ll also learn, but I&#39;m not concerned about learning a new programming language).</p> <p>I&#39;m mostly a self-taught programmer, and through my experience I&#39;ve noticed that while self-learning is awesome and I can easily parse through documentation and learn new things, there are certain subjects that are harder to learn on your own, <strong><em>mainly because its difficult to find them &quot;by yourself&quot;.</em></strong> </p> <p>FOR EXAMPLE: in my self-learning path, I never crossed paths with more <em>&quot;theoretical&quot; or &quot;abstract&quot;</em> concepts such as design patterns, architecture principles or low-level tweaks and improvements: I came into contact with them in my first job. <strong>Meaning that there&#39;s a substantial amount of very important knowledge that you risk on missing out if you&#39;re not exposed to it</strong> either through a more complex and &quot;professional&quot; codebase or by working with more experienced people. </p> <p><strong>And that&#39;s a fear I&#39;ve got with game-dev:</strong> Sure, I can start with Godot, but I fear (and please tell me if this is misguided) that I might miss out on important &quot;fundamentals&quot; that I might only learn if I start &quot;from the ground up&quot; following a tutorial such as Lazy Foo (IDK, low code optimization, some secret pattern that will be abstracted away by the engine). But then again... is that really necessary for shipping out a good game? Will focusing on those (as I understand them) low-level details eventually hinder my progress? Does this even make sense?</p> <p>For example, reading over the wiki&#39;s <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php">LazyFoo Tutorial</a>, I see a bunch of things that you don&#39;t typically see in your engine nor in the &quot;how to get started on game-dev&quot; videos, and I fear that if I start directly with the Engine I might be making a similar mistake as to <strong>learning SpringBoot instead of understanding Java, or learning React before having a good grasp on Javascript.</strong> But I also fear that if I start with these &quot;low-level&quot; or very basic fundamentals, I&#39;ll never ship out something interesting and might get demotivated. And who knows, maybe I&#39;ll find out about those low-level details in the future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Non-taken-Meursault"> /u/Non-taken-Meursault </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kt88vm/backend_programmer_struggling_with_either/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kt88vm/backend_programmer_struggling_with_either/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><blockquote> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> ‚Äî Kubetail now has ‚ö° fast in-cluster search, 1,000+ stars, multi-cluster CLI flags, and an open roadmap; we‚Äôre looking for new contributors (especially designers).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Kubetail</strong> is an open-source, general-purpose logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across multi-container workloads in real-time. The primary entry point for Kubetail is the <code>kubetail</code> CLI tool, which can launch a local web dashboard on your desktop or stream raw logs directly to your terminal. To install Kubetail, see the Quickstart instructions in our <a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail">README</a>.</p> <p>The communities here on Reddit (especially <a href="/r/kubernetes">r/kubernetes</a>, <a href="/r/devops">r/devops</a> and <a href="/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a>) have been so supportive over the last month and I‚Äôm truly grateful. I‚Äôm excited to share some of the updates that came as a result of that support.</p> <h1>What&#39;s new</h1> <h1>üåü Growth</h1> <p>Before posting to Reddit, we had 400 stars, a few intrepid users and one lead developer talking to himself in our Discord. Now we&#39;ve broken 1,000 stars, have new users coming in every day, and we have an awesome, growing community that loves to build together. We also just added a maintainer to the project who happens to be a Redditor and who first found out about us from our post last month (welcome <a href="https://github.com/rxinui">@rxinui</a>).</p> <p>Kubetail is a full-stack app (typescript/react, go, rust) which makes it a lot of fun to work on. If you want to sharpen your coding skills and contribute to a project that&#39;s helping Kubernetes users to monitor their cluster workloads in real-time, come join us. We&#39;re especially eager to find a designer who loves working on data intensive, user-facing GUIs. To start contributing, click on the Discord link in our README:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail">https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail</a></p> <h1>üîç Search</h1> <p>Last month we released a preview of our real-time log search tool and I&#39;m happy to say that it&#39;s now available to everyone in our latest official release. The search feature is powered by a custom rust binary that wraps the excellent <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> library which makes it incredibly fast. To enable log search in your Kubetail Dashboard, you have to install the &quot;Kubetail API&quot; in your cluster which can be done by running <code>kubetail cluster install</code> using our CLI tool. Once the API resources are running, search queries from the Dashboard are sent to agents running in your cluster which perform remote grep on your behalf and send back matching log records to your browser. Try out our live demo and let us know what you think!</p> <p><a href="https://www.kubetail.com/demo">https://www.kubetail.com/demo</a></p> <h1>üèéÔ∏è Roadmap</h1> <p>Recently we published our <a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap-and-status">official roadmap</a> so that everyone can see where we&#39;re at and where we&#39;re headed:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">-</th> <th align="left">Step</th> <th align="left">Status</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">1</td> <td align="left">Real-time container logs</td> <td align="left">‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">2</td> <td align="left">Real-time search and polished user experience</td> <td align="left">üõ†Ô∏è</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">3</td> <td align="left">Real-time system logs (e.g. systemd, k8s events)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">4</td> <td align="left">Basic customizability (e.g. colors, time formats)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">5</td> <td align="left">Message parsing and metrics</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">6</td> <td align="left">Historic data (e.g. log archives, metrics time series)</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">7</td> <td align="left">Kubetail API and developer-facing client libraries</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">N</td> <td align="left">World Peace</td> <td align="left">üî≤</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Of course, we&#39;d love to hear your feedback. Let us know what you think!</p> <h1>ü™Ñ Usability improvements</h1> <p>Since last month we&#39;ve made a lot of usability improvements to the Kubetail Dashboard. Now, both the workload viewer and the logging console have collapsible sidebars so you can dedicate more real estate to the main data pane (thanks <a href="https://github.com/harshcodesdev">@harshcodesdev</a>). We also added a search box to the workload viewer which makes it easy to find specific workloads when there are a large number to browse through (thanks <a href="https://github.com/victorchrollo14">@victorchrollo14</a>). Another neat change we made is that we removed an <code>EndpointSlices</code> requirement which means that now Kubetail works down past Kubernetes 1.17.</p> <h1>üíª Multi-cluster support in terminal</h1> <p>Recently we added two very useful features to the CLI tool that enable you to switch between multiple clusters easily. Now you can use the <code>--kubeconfig</code> and <code>--kube-context</code> flags when using the <code>kubetail logs</code> sub-command to set your kube config file and the context to use (thanks @rxinui). For example, this command will fetch all the logs for the &quot;web&quot; deployment in the &quot;my-context&quot; context defined in a custom location:</p> <pre><code>$ kubetail logs deployments/web \ --kubeconfig ~/.kube/my-config \ --kube-context my-context \ --since 2025-04-20T00:00:00Z \ --until 2025-04-21T00:00:00Z \ --all &gt; logs.txt </code></pre> <h1>What&#39;s next</h1> <p>Currently we&#39;re working on permissions-handling features that will allow Kubetail to be used in environments where users are only given access to certain namespaces. We&#39;re also working on enabling client-side search for users who don&#39;t need &quot;remote grep&quot;.</p> <p>We love hearing from you!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m working on a fairly large rust GUI application (~1100 dependencies). Recently I&#39;ve it&#39;s begun to stall with no apparent rhyme or reason, requiring the program to be forcefully killed. Sometimes it happens soon after startup, sometimes it happens after using the app for a while, oftentimes it doesn&#39;t happen for hours on end.</p> <p>With the app suddenly becoming unresponsive, it smells like either a deadlock or an infinite loop happening on the main thread. Though with such a large number of dependencies and no reliable reproduction, it&#39;s not clear where to start looking. Is there any way to attach some kind of instrumentation to the program so that I can view the call stack when it /does/ stall?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JoJoJet-"> /u/JoJoJet- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kshukl/how_to_debug_a_rust_program_when_it_stalls/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kshukl/how_to_debug_a_rust_program_when_it_stalls/">[comments]</a></span></div>
