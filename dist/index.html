            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In games like Call of Duty: Black Ops II (mission Karma), there are 2D billboarded sprite animations of human figures (e.g. a dancing woman) placed inside a fully 3D environment — similar to DOOM-style sprites but more realistic.</p> <p>For some reason, this kind of effect genuinely unsettles me more than low-poly 3D characters or even horror elements. Something about a flat, looping human animation existing in 3D space feels “wrong” on a perceptual level.</p> <p>From a game dev / rendering / psychology perspective: • Is this related to uncanny valley, billboarding, lack of depth cues, or motion perception? • Is this a known phenomenon in player perception or UX research? • Are there design reasons devs expect or use this discomfort intentionally?</p> <p>I’m really curious whether this reaction is common and if there’s a technical or cognitive explanation behind it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ambitious_Method2740"> /u/Ambitious_Method2740 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8stw1/why_do_2d_sprite_animations_inside_3d_games_feel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8stw1/why_do_2d_sprite_animations_inside_3d_games_feel/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I was 9 years old, my dad bought a used PC. Having a PC at home was almost unheard of at that time in the country I grew up in, but he believed that it would shape my life, so he spent a fortune to get it. The whole family learned to type, navigate MSDOS, trying out different games on 5 inch floppy disks... And he even got me programming books, so I started learning BASIC. The books sucked, and the sample codes had lots of errors, but we loved it. I remember writing code with him in BASIC, which played the Ode to Joy tune through the motherboard speaker using a dataset manually entered one music note at a time.</p> <p>I remember making a stock trading simulator game to make fun of his day trading hobby, and made him play it until he lost all his &quot;money&quot;. </p> <p>Seven years later, when the economy took a heavy hit, my mom took me and migrated to another country. My dad stayed behind because he couldn&#39;t part with his hometown. Then I went to college, graduated, got a job, got married, had a baby, and got into game development. Every time I made some kind of progress, I would show some screenshots to him for feedback, but could never show any gameplay video, because youtube was banned there. And when I finally released my dream game, he was so excited for me, and was showing it to all his relatives and friends who remotely give a damn about gaming. But he couldn&#39;t play the game, because his PC couldn&#39;t handle it. I remember he said to me, &quot;when you sell your first million dollars, let me know!&quot; </p> <p>I took it as a joke at the time, of course, since I never thought I would sell my game for a million dollars. </p> <p>In 2022, he suffered a very painful, aggressive form of bone cancer, and passed away right before Christmas. The country was just at the peak of its covid restriction, so I had no way to go visit him, and just a day before he was still talking to me online, and the next day my aunt told me that he was acting strange, speaking non-sense. They took him to the hospital, and then my aunt told me he passed away. Only a year ago, I was just talking to my mom about helping him get a visa to travel here for visit. I was excited to show him the house, the kids, to cook for him since I&#39;m very good at it, and most importantly I wanted him to play my game, with all sixty thousand words translated to our native language by myself.</p> <p>But I didn&#39;t get to do any of that. He never met his grand children in person, never tasted anything I cooked, and never played the game I took ten years to make. </p> <p>And today, the gross revenue for my game just hit 1 million dollars. He asked me to tell him when I sell my first million. But he&#39;s gone. I want him to play my game. I want him to be proud of me. I want to tell him all about the joys and tears in the last ten years. I wanted to show him how 85,587 gamers entrusted me with their hard-earned money.</p> <p>Can you hear me, dad? My game just hit 1 million. I know you are proud of me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rotorist"> /u/Rotorist </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8p4qf/ten_years_of_hard_work_and_the_day_has_finally/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8p4qf/ten_years_of_hard_work_and_the_day_has_finally/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Main engines I&#39;m working with are unreal and Godot.

I know mocap is an option, albeit one of the most expensive ones. I&#39;ve also seen one game where the guy literally just filmed his own arms and threw a pixel Shader on it. I&#39;ve also heard people just use mixamo animations that they customized to save time on having to make them from scratch. </p> <p>I&#39;m curious what other options and techniques are available, such as using filmed animations and translating those as a sort of midpoint between mocap and handcrafted in blender.</p> <p>As far as software I&#39;m familiar with the usual suspects, such as blender, maya, 3DS max, Etc, but I&#39;ve only ever dabbled ( and I can&#39;t stress enough how lightly I mean it when I say dabbled) in blender before, so this is definitely not my realm of expertise</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shiek200"> /u/shiek200 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8h9s2/options_for_making_3d_animations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8h9s2/options_for_making_3d_animations/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR: This last weekend we did our first playtest ever with the community and it blown up (from 120 members to 620) a bit, <strong>it was the best game dev experience of our lifes!</strong> even if it may seem insignificant!.</p> <p>Some info about the project first:</p> <p>Old school indie mmorpg, built by 2 (programmer + 3d artist) + 1 stand-in technical artist (he came in the last month to help a bit!), in development for 1 year in our spare-time</p> <p>I wanted to share some data about the playtest we did the last weekend and the impact it had in our community, want to keep the post short so here is the data just in case it&#39;s useful for some folks!</p> <p><strong>The playtest was private so to access we had to give keys.</strong> It was like a technical test with little content.</p> <p><strong>December 30th</strong> - Playtest announcement post in our discord.</p> <p>80 people reacted (wanted a key). At this point we had 120 members that were already in our community</p> <p><strong>January 2nd</strong> - Playtest start</p> <p>When we opened the server, 40 concurrent players joined, the playtest was supposed to be only for the community but the server was so stable that we decided to open it up a bit, so we did a reddit post. Also one youtuber(extremly focused on indie mmos) streamed the playtest briging in 30 players or more!</p> <p><strong>January 3rd</strong> - Post in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RagnarokOnline/comments/1q2qyz0/torebia_online_our_ragnarok_online_inspired/">Ragnarok Online community</a>.</p> <p>This post had 30k views and 50 comments, topping the community during the day, and the players rain started. The #welcome channel in discord start burning, we started to hand keys to everyone, the day finished with a total of <strong>111 new players.</strong> As it was going quite well, we decided to do another post in another targeted community, the mmorpg reddit.</p> <p><strong>January 4th (in the afternoon)</strong> - Post in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1q3t7s7/torebia_online_our_indie_mmorpg_playtest_is/">MMORPG community</a></p> <p>This post reached 80k views, 150 likes and 120 comments (we couldnt share our discord link here, the comments number is that big because of that) also being the 1# or 2# post of that comunity during all day. During this day <strong>150 new players</strong> joined (the post from ragnarok community was giving tons of players too)</p> <p><strong>January 5th (we extended the playtest)</strong></p> <p>In theory, the playtest was set to end on 4th, but as so many people were joining we decided to extend it for two days more.</p> <p>Result: <strong>100 new players</strong> from both posts and word of mouth</p> <p><strong>January 6th (the last day)</strong></p> <p>During this day, new players started to slow down a bit, and <strong>60 new players</strong> joined</p> <p>January 7th and 8th (playtest already done)</p> <p><strong>40 new players</strong> joined but couldnt play</p> <p>Things that I think worked well:</p> <ul> <li>Posts on specific communities </li> <li>Not having steam store page up. I think this was good somehow since people were kinda forced to join discord to join the playtest. We probably missed tons of people because of that but also I feel that for our type of project having a discord community is quite important.</li> </ul> <p>Things that we could&#39;ve improved:</p> <ul> <li>Some kind of automated bot to give keys. The most stress came from actually answering to all the key requests, specially when we were sleeping we feel super anxious that people could miss out</li> </ul> <p>We did also a survey after the playtest (google form) that 50 people answered with golden feedback</p> <p>Some last words:</p> <p>As a personal (and team) level this experience was amazing, most of the people were giving insanely good feedback and people were engaged a lot. We had content for honestly 2 hours top of playing and there were people spending more than 10 hours which seems crazy to me in that state of the game.</p> <p>Used to have so many bad news in the games industry lately, this feelt great</p> <p>Hope this helps or inspire others somehow!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I had to let go of a project last year due to not finding any publisher support. Decided to make a small game inspired by **Sort the Court** and try to have fun with it. Here&#39;s a timeline for things.</p> <p><strong>Store page live on 12/12 (huh didn&#39;t realize that until now)</strong></p> <p>(+ 30WL)</p> <p>Just posted on bluesky. I&#39;m not planning on using twitter. I was also a bit tired around this time so I was off my game.</p> <p>I made some plans to announce the game on some subreddits that you can check out on my profile.</p> <p><strong>GamesPress announcement on 12/17 - 12/23</strong></p> <p>(+ 196WL)</p> <p>The formatting for the GamesPress post wasn&#39;t what I intended and at first thought the bunch of WL came from a reddit post. I did a search for the game and realized that a random twitter account covered it and that got around 35k views and 1k likes.</p> <p><strong>GameTrailers post on 12/24 - 12/27</strong></p> <p>(+ 510WL)</p> <p>I emailed IGN and such with a link to the twitter account and just asked if they could post the trailer. They ended up putting it on the GT channel.</p> <p>This was when things took off for us.</p> <p>At first the video got around 3k views which was more than my first game. I was fine with that and hoped it would hit 5k. It&#39;s now at 90k views. Wild. I thought it would top out way way earlier. The comments were nice to read with the team.</p> <p><strong>IGN post on 12/28 - 12/30</strong></p> <p>(+ 322WL)</p> <p>A dev friend convinced me to reach out to IGN to be on the main page. We think that due to it being a slow time of the year they actually did it after I asked. The GT video was at 49k views so I figured why not.</p> <p>IGN topped out at 17k views. So not well when compared to other casual games like Nippets, but I was just grateful it happened at all. Maybe its an audience thing.</p> <p><strong>Slow down 12/31 - 1/1</strong></p> <p>(+ 50WL)</p> <p>I made a post on reddit that did well by my standards. Couple that with two YT videos and things were looking okay.</p> <p><strong>Indie Games Hub 1/2 to 1/8</strong></p> <p>(+ 561WL)</p> <p>Despite being a smaller channel it revitalized things I think. On the first day it barely got 2k views so I just assumed we got luck with the GamesTrailer and that it would be like IGN where it tops out at around 10k or so.</p> <p>It&#39;s sitting at around 57k views now which is surprising.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>Overall around 169k eyes have seen the game. I&#39;m still stunned really.</p> <p>I&#39;m not an expert and can 100% say why it did well, but I think we got lucky with the timing.</p> <p>I also think the art and audio team did a tremendous job to make things eye catchy and fitting.</p> <p>I&#39;d recommend GamesPress because you never know who may see it.</p> <p>If anyone else is aware of other YouTube channels that cover indies I&#39;d like to know.</p> <p>I have a 9-5 and fund this project with that. I do everything that isn&#39;t creating audio/art assets.</p> <p>I hope this is helpful to some of you. I&#39;d be more than happy to answer any questions. This sub has introduced some positive things I&#39;ve learned from and I&#39;d like to give back in some way despite not being an SSS tier dev.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BlooOwlBaba"> /u/BlooOwlBaba </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8ak2w/my_new_game_got_1700_wishlists_in_less_than_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q8ak2w/my_new_game_got_1700_wishlists_in_less_than_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’m Burak. I’ve been working on a retro open-world game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4226560?utm_source=bufuak&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=WL_5K">ALATURKA </a>(set in 1970s Istanbul) as a side project in my free time.</p> <p>A month ago, I finally launched my Steam page. As of today, I&#39;ve passed <strong>5,000 wishlists</strong>.</p> <p>I know this isn&#39;t a massive viral hit compared to some projects here, but for a solo dev with zero budget working nights and weekends, I’m really happy with it. I wanted to share the breakdown of how I got here in case it helps anyone else currently grinding.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> I’ve been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bufuak">livestreaming </a>the process for about a year (over 50 streams, ~150 hours live), and I didn&#39;t have a Steam page until last month. As an Unreal Authorized Instructor and Community Leader, I started this project to be a guideline to other developers. I didn&#39;t have any idea that one day I could launch the Steam page. I just wanted to build a small community that enjoyed the process.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> I took the progress bits from the livestreams and posted them as Reels/TikToks. Surprisingly, these racked up about <strong>15 million impressions</strong> locally. This was the main driver. By the time I said &quot;The Steam page is open,&quot; people already knew what the project was.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> I didn&#39;t have enough polished gameplay for a proper &quot;Reveal Trailer&quot; when I launched the page. Instead, I made what I call a &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/KzEmZ9RitH0">Vision Trailer</a>&quot;, basically talking about the process and just showing the atmosphere, the physics, and the art style to set the mood. It ended up getting 100k+ views on <a href="https://x.com/bufuak/status/1999193891874996733?s=20">Twitter </a>and got picked up by local press (<a href="https://tr.ign.com/alaturka/132057/news/gta-turk-yapimi-olsaydi-neye-benzerdi-bagimsiz-gelistirici-burak-aksahin-yeni-oyunu-alaturka-ile-bu">IGN Turkey</a>).</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Since I&#39;m Turkish, most of my initial wishlists were local. To test if this concept worked globally, I started a fresh English-speaking YouTube channel and posted <a href="https://youtu.be/NT9-6HD5Ra4">my first English devlog</a>. It got nearly 10k views and 400 subs pretty quickly, and now I&#39;m seeing traffic coming in from all around the world.</p> <p>If you have questions about streaming your dev work, how I handled the page launch or anything about my game/progress so far feel free to ask.</p> <p>Keep up the good work, everyone!<br/> Burak.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bufuak_"> /u/Bufuak_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q85xt1/i_hit_5000_wishlists_in_my_first_month_as_a_solo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1q85xt1/i_hit_5000_wishlists_in_my_first_month_as_a_solo/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently been playing around with using Raspberry Pis and Golang for my embedded/robotics development. So far I have applied it to two different projects: Interfacing a serial coin acceptor to an N64 and 2-axis satellite tracker. Here are some of the biggest wins I&#39;ve discovered:</p> <ol> <li>Easy Cross Compilation</li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s trivial to develop on your main machine, run <code>GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o sat_tracker</code> and then <code>scp</code> it over the Pi</p> <ol> <li>Using Viper/Config files for GPIO</li> </ol> <p>For the satellite tracker, I could easily change the GPIO pins I was using for the stepper drivers without recompiling. This came in really handy when I made the jump from a breadboard to a more permanent solution.</p> <ol> <li>Using interfaces for abstracting hardware</li> </ol> <p>Here is an example of an Interface for an N64 flashcart</p> <pre><code> type N64 interface { Start() error Close() error SendData(data []byte) error ReceiveData() ([]byte, error) } </code></pre> <p>In the future, if I ever move to a different flashcart, the primary logic of the code stays the same.</p> <ol> <li>Mocking Hardware</li> </ol> <p>This is also really useful for mocking things like GPIO pins on desktop PCs that don&#39;t have that hardware. I could run tests with the SGP4 orbital math and test that the steppers would have gone to the correct angle based on the number of calls to <code>High()</code> and <code>Low()</code></p> <p>All in all, this has been a really useful exercise and I hope to build some neat packages to use across even more projects in the future.</p> <p>If you&#39;d like to see these projects in action, I made some YouTube videos to showcase them:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://youtu.be/NZe8RbimB9g">Satellite Tracker</a></li> <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Z_uFcPic5kE">N64 coin acceptor mod</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PrintAndPanic"> /u/PrintAndPanic </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1q8rp6x/using_go_to_treat_hardware_like_microservices/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1q8rp6x/using_go_to_treat_hardware_like_microservices/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I’ve been building a desktop app with Wails, and it’s actually grown to the point where I now have some real users. I love the Go + frontend workflow, but I’m seriously hitting a wall with v2. The lack of native multi-window support and a proper tray API has become a massive headache.I’ve had to rely on some community solutions, but getting them such as system tray to play nicely with Wails v2’s lifecycle is a difficulty.</p> <p>I’ve been eyeing Wails v3 for a while because it seems to fix exactly what I’m struggling with. But it’s been in alpha for so long, and since I now have actual users depending on my app, I’m terrified of introducing new instability and I dont want to use electron or tarui though they are also excellent frameworks.</p> <p>For anyone who’s already taken the plunge and switched to v3, is it “production-stable” in practice, or are you still running into frequent crashes? Specifically, do the multi-window and system tray features work reliably across windows and macos, or are there still a bunch of weird workarounds needed?</p> <p>I’m dying to move over for the new features, but I’d love to hear some real-world feedback before I commit.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>More specifically, Gemini Pro as an Emacs user.</p> <p>Long question: As a solo developer, I&#39;ve been reluctant to use AI much. I occasionally ask an AI in the browser and copy &amp; paste code snippets. But I feel I need to use it more as many others seem to be using AI more productively for Go development. I just canceled a ChatGPT Go subscription because it was too stupid and wasted a lot of my time. Now I&#39;m trying a Gemini Pro subscription and am confused by the web-based tooling. Cloud Shell feels clumsy, it&#39;s good that it can show diffs but I haven&#39;t managed to even import a whole project into it. It only accepts single file uploads. (Or, am I missing something?)</p> <p>I&#39;ve also tried Google AI Studio and it was horrible, like a bunch of ads and a very small prompt. Again, there was no way to upload a whole project folder to analyze it. When I followed &quot;AI advise&quot; and uploaded a .zip, it failed on token count. Apparently, it cannot or does not distinguish between files it can process and files to ignore like built executables. It also didn&#39;t accept a App.vue file of a Wails app frontend. I was hoping to be able to analyze some small projects completely and let it do some rote conversion tasks or make suggestions.</p> <p>Can someone advise me what tooling they use productively? Should I switch to VS Code, which has better AI integration than Emacs? What&#39;s your workflow?</p> <p>I&#39;m looking only for tools that <em>make suggestions and never touch any files</em> directly.

I am excited to that I was able to achieve impossible query speeds!</p> <p>This is the query, executed against <strong>5 million rows:</strong></p> <pre><code>SELECT id, name, job_title, salary, department, age, manager, location, hire_date, degree, skills, current_project, performance_score, is_active, created_at, updated_at, is_fired FROM employees WHERE salary &gt;= 249999.0 LIMIT 100 </code></pre> <p>I took between <strong>6</strong> to <strong>7 ms</strong> to find the correct rows.</p> <p>You may ask how this was achieved without any sort of indexing or caching?</p> <p>There is something called <code>concurrent_processor</code> in my codebase which does handle read queries. This is some sort of modular scheduler for different tasks which give you the final result.</p> <p>If you simply instruct it to find <code>salary &gt;= 249999.0</code>, it will scan sequentially all rows, which is not that slow, but it takes between <strong>100 to 120ms</strong>.</p> <p>The reason is because it does all the needed operations, such as reading, decoding, comparing and all that sorts of things 5 million times.</p> <p>What if there is a guaranteed way to do this without having to scan 5 million rows? 😀</p> <p>Here comes into play something like an interceptor within the <code>concurrent_processor</code> which tries it&#39;s best to decrease the rows needed for the scan, 100% of the time, and it&#39;s called:</p> <p><strong>Semantic Mapping Engine!</strong></p> <p>It consists of the scanner and of the engine itself. The scanner tries to scan the whole table, all 5 million rows to find the best possible rules that determine were the data is located.</p> <p>After mapping and saving the data (takes from 4% space worst case scenario down to below 1% of the actual data) it allows for blazingly fast candidate creation.</p> <p>These candidates are potential rows that might be fulfilling the query criteria, and finally the actual rows&#39; data is processed, and the needed rows are returned.</p> <p>This dramatically decreases query times.</p> <p>It&#39;s still in alpha stage but anyone can try it now!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/milen-denev/rasterizeddb">https://github.com/milen-denev/rasterizeddb</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Milen_Dnv"> /u/Milen_Dnv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8r2rm/6_to_7ms_to_scan_5_million_rows_kinda_using_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8r2rm/6_to_7ms_to_scan_5_million_rows_kinda_using_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This is just nice to have as it will allow you to choose files, add commands, and exec into containers</p> <p>- current problems/bugs</p> <p>the docker container manager automatically exec&#39;s you into the container. Gonna have to change that to allow you to just start up container and leave it so you can auto deploy stuff easily.</p> <p>ssh hopping needs work. Currently a lot of features break down with the SSH hop system like docker management and the ssh health dashboard that I started working on. It just complicates everything with this system, but I use it for work so I&#39;ll still make it work</p> <p>scrolling bugs. Currently if you scroll there becomes rendering issues with the text as the text moves up from the bottom and not down from the top. This was not somethign I saw coming so I&#39;ll be fixing it by next week.</p> <p>- future updates</p> <p>ssh health dashboard: allow you to monitor the logs and compute usage of all computers you&#39;ve registered with ssh manager</p> <p>docker health dashboard: same thing as ssh health dashboard, but for docker</p> <p>kuberentes manager: this is just an expansion on the docker and ssh manager. I use kuberentes a lot for work so if I&#39;m gonna make a terminal then I want it to be able to manage these systems without calling something else</p> <p>cloud connection: Right now the ssh, docker, and soon kubernetes managers are all step 1 with step 2 being &quot;Do it on aws, gcp, and azure.&quot; Eventually I want this terminal to ease general development on desktop for me. This is an end goal though and probably won&#39;t be started for a few months </p> <p>Let me know what you guys think. What would be good adds or, if you use it, what are some problems that I haven&#39;t listed</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LecherousCthulu"> /u/LecherousCthulu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8di71/update_on_ratterm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8di71/update_on_ratterm/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, back from the <a href="https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh">iroh</a> grassroots marketing department I&#39;ve created a new thing.</p> <p>Jokes aside, <code>iroh</code> is a cool project and I have a few local devices that I want to access remotely without opening up my network, so now I&#39;ve created a remote shell à la <code>ssh</code> that runs over <code>iroh</code>.</p> <h2>P2term</h2> <p>Repo <a href="https://github.com/marcusGrass/p2term">here</a></p> <p>P2term is a remote shell that you can connect to using cryptographic keys, it has a basic server/client-structure where you run the daemon <code>p2termd</code> on the server, and connect to it using <code>p2term</code>.</p> <p>Since <code>iroh</code> runs in the browser, you can use a browser session to connect as a client (I&#39;m hosting one at <a href="https://term.mgrass.dev">https://term.mgrass.dev</a> currently), it&#39;s just an extremely simple vibe-coded <code>html/css/js</code>-single-pager (<a href="https://github.com/MarcusGrass/p2term/blob/main/p2term-web/index.html">this</a>) that uses <a href="https://xtermjs.org/">xtermjs</a> for terminal emulation and proxies in/out to a <code>wasm</code>-library containing the connection logic.</p> <p>See the repo for the details.</p> <h2>Should you use this</h2> <p>Not at work.</p> <h2>Platforms</h2> <p>Tested on <code>linux</code> and <code>mac</code> as both host and client (cross-shelling also works, i.e. linux client ssh&#39;s to a mac host and vice versa). Theoretically <code>windows</code>-hosts should also work but I haven&#39;t tested it. <code>windows</code> clients don&#39;t work since this project is implemented using <code>pty</code> which <code>windows</code> does not have. It could probably be made to work though.</p> <h2>Caveats</h2> <p>It works well enough for the simple case of popping a terminal to some remote server, but <code>ssh</code> is a massive codebase for a reason. The implementation is extremely naive, it&#39;s essentially a remote-proxy of raw bytes from the terminal into the <code>iroh</code> connection (on both sides). There is no added security.</p> <p>Running <code>p2termd</code> exposes a raw shell to anyone with access to connect, so it&#39;s inherently dangerous in the same way that <code>ssh</code> is. You can (and should if actually using this) create an <code>ACL</code> using the configuration, only allowing connections from known public keys. In that case only those keys can connect to the service. Treat the secret key accompanying those public keys as sensitive credentials (keep them in a password manager f.e).</p> <h2>P2proxy</h2> <p>If <code>iroh</code> seems cool and interesting, and you&#39;re thinking: &quot;Hey, I could create a TCP-proxy that exposes some locally hosted site from a device without opening any ports&quot;, that&#39;s what I did last time with <a href="https://github.com/marcusGrass/p2proxy">p2proxy</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nylor2/using_iroh_to_create_a_peer_to_peer_reverse_proxy/">reddit post</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SuspiciousSegfault"> /u/SuspiciousSegfault </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8a962/p2term_a_peertopeer_shell_implemented_using_iroh/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1q8a962/p2term_a_peertopeer_shell_implemented_using_iroh/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I need the Stream and Sink to send their resources back to the manager when they&#39;re recycled, so there are 2 channels for that.
