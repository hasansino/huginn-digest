So my plans for the future is to somehow make this GridEngine to be multiplayer, so multiple persons can work on a dashboard and the server will handle the positions of the items, the collisions and make sure that everyone is seeing the same thing.<br/> But for now there is the project that i have.<br/> I do not use rust professionally yet and this is my first real project, so, would appreciate any reviews.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ago1999"> /u/ago1999 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ksej63/just_released_a_grid_engine_that_handles/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ksej63/just_released_a_grid_engine_that_handles/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I got this:</p> <pre><code>WARNING: clamav-1.4-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: File /usr/bin/clambc in package clamav contains reference to TMPDIR File /usr/bin/sigtool in package clamav contains reference to TMPDIR [buildpaths] WARNING: clamav-1.4-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: File /usr/lib/libfreshclam.so.3.0.2 in package clamav-libclamav contains reference to TMPDIR File /usr/lib/libclamav.so.12.0.3 in package clamav-libclamav contains reference to TMPDIR [buildpaths] WARNING: clamav-1.4-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: File /usr/lib/libclamav_rust.a in package clamav-staticdev contains reference to TMPDIR [buildpaths] </code></pre> <p>So, I started at the bottom with the <code>libclamav_rust.a</code> build artifact. I listed its contents with <code>ar -t</code>. That was a bust. It just lists the files inside the library archive. How would <code>do_package_qa</code> have discovered that some component of the build paths got encoded into this static library archive? I know, I use <code>strings | grep build/</code>, and there they are. Piping through wc shows 391 references. Basicly every single rust component&#39;s source file has its full path inside my build container encoded into it. Some components have multiple source files represented.</p> <pre><code>/workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/clamav/1.4/cargo_home/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bzip2-rs-0.1.2/src/huffman.rs /workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/clamav/1.4/cargo_home/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bzip2-rs-0.1.2/src/crc.rs /workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/clamav/1.4/cargo_home/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bzip2-rs-0.1.2/src/decoder/mod.rs /workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/clamav/1.4/cargo_home/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bzip2-rs-0.1.2/src/move_to_front.rs /workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/clamav/1.4/cargo_home/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bzip2-rs-0.1.2/src/block/bwt.rs </code></pre> <p>Not really sure where to start. I&#39;m not really familiar with the rust build system, and ClamAV&#39;s a big, promiscuous code base that pulls stuff in from all over, not just Rust. I&#39;m sure encoding everything after <code>/workdir/&lt;local&gt;-os/build/work/core2-64-&lt;local&gt;-linux/</code> would be fine, but to include that everywhere, it&#39;s just irrelevant information leakage. QA issue.</p> <p>As you can see, it&#39;s not just the rust code base that&#39;s doing it. The freshclam dynamic library and clambc binary have the problem too. The <code>libclamav_rust.a</code> was simply at the bottom of the list, so I thought to start there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmbeddedSoftEng"> /u/EmbeddedSoftEng </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ks89mp/bitbake_build_of_clamav_creates_static_libraries/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ks89mp/bitbake_build_of_clamav_creates_static_libraries/">[comments]</a></span></div>

There are cloud solutions like E2B, but I couldn&#39;t find any &quot;easy to use&quot; self-hosted option. Got tired of looking and just started writing my own. What I ended up building is an orchestrator for lightweight VMs (no containers!). Gets going in milliseconds and its all on your infra. </p> <p>The SDK is the part I&#39;m most excited about and there is a Python SDK already that lets you create and manage these secure environments with just a few lines of code. You can spin up isolated VMs, run whatever in them, tear them down, all programmatically. No complex setup. Just 3-4 lines to create a sandbox and run your code in it. </p> <p>This is definitely early days tho; expect rough edges! The Python SDK is there but I&#39;m starting on the Rust SDK next (would love your thoughts on API design). </p> <p>If you are building dev tools, working with AI agents, or just need proper isolation without the usual performance headaches, I&#39;d really appreciate your thoughts. </p> <p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox">https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NyproTheGeek"> /u/NyproTheGeek </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ks5vr6/microsandbox_sdk_for_running_aigenerated_code_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ks5vr6/microsandbox_sdk_for_running_aigenerated_code_in/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve generally never really had issues with cargo but this is incredibly annoying. I have a project with a LOT of dependencies that I actively work on. I have this up on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> and generally let CI do the publish. The cargo publish CI pipeline I have literally always fails because of the same reason - cargo publish for some reason picks up the latest available version of any crate not the version in Cargo.lock. At times this is 3 major versions above the version I want. </p> <p>This leads to a lot of issues - one of them is that the latest versions of some crates have a MSRV that is greater than the version I want my project to be in. Another is that jumping a lot of major versions will for sure have breaking changes and it just fails to compile that crate. In some cases pinning versions in the cargo.toml helps but I cant be doing this every single time, I have way too many dependencies. I have no issues with cargo build and this projects builds perfectly alright. This really messes with my whole workflow, I have to get involved manually every single time because cargo publish does this. </p> <p>Regarding solutions, everyone who has brought this up is linked to open issues from years ago. So I&#39;m not sure if there are any strong intentions to solve this (I really hope Im wrong here). But has anyone else dealt with this? Surprisingly this issue isnt brought up as much as I would imagine it to have been. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a reliable way to get around this? </p> <p>On a side note - this really makes no sense to me. Working with cargo has really been a charm other than this annoying bit. Are there any clear intentions behind this? Why would you not want to respect the cargo.lock here given that you know that the project compiles with those versions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/therealjesusofficial"> /u/therealjesusofficial </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1krr6po/cargolock_not_respected_when_doing_a_cargo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1krr6po/cargolock_not_respected_when_doing_a_cargo/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I spent over a year and half working on my first game project to be released on Steam, and now I completely hate it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think the game is <em>complete</em> shit, I am proud of the concept, I think the final product is okay, but part of me still fucking hates it. After release, and taking a step back, I realised that the game itself ended up being really stupid, pretty mediocre and the whole process of making it wasn‚Äôt worth any of the mental anguish.</p> <p>I wasted so much time dedicating all of my energy onto this project that it ruined me. I could have been using my time working a full-time job instead too, especially since my family is on the poorer side. For context, I‚Äôm 20. I kind of used indie game development as a form of escapism from my irl situation ‚Äî now I realize that was incredibly stupid and pointless.</p> <p>I do enjoy the actual process of game development, hence why I spent my time doing it. I did all of the programming, drew all of the art, and my friend kindly helped me with the music. But I also wanted to actually release my game on Steam too, and I didn‚Äôt want the game to flop.</p> <p>So I tried hiring a marketing agency to help me‚Ä¶ I spent $3,000 (now I realize is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever spent my money on) on a marketing campaign for the game, only for it to get minimal results and hardly any wishlists. The company I payed promised that the game would get thousands of wishlists and influencers would play it, but that never happened. Some YouTubers with few subscribers did play the game, but ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù kind of implies they have a few thousand subscribers at least - plus the YouTubers who played it only got it from a Keymailer promotion that I bought too, so it was separate from that ‚Äúmarketing campaign‚Äù. Huge hassle, and they even threatened me with legal action if I didn‚Äôt pay them more money.</p> <p>Making this game fucked up my mental health for over a year, wasted tons of money, time and energy. All of this effort, only for it to not amount to anything. But I was dumb enough to keep working on it, make it to the finish line, and release it on Steam, for literally no reason. Can I say I made a game on Steam? Yes, but was it worth it? Hell no. At this point, I‚Äôve accepted the fact I lost all of that money and that the game was pretty much a failure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mkmuffi"> /u/mkmuffi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksb8uh/i_hate_myself_for_making_my_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksb8uh/i_hate_myself_for_making_my_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So to expand on the title, I&#39;m not a game developer, but I follow some games that are in early alpha testing (multiple years from release). Say a game is in early alpha testing, and features/systems/content/graphics etc. are constantly being added, tweaked, changed, removed as more passes are being made, would a company do optimisation work this early? In my mind the answer would be no, as imagine you do some optimisations with the lighting, but then you do a major lighting pass later, I&#39;d imagine you&#39;d need to then go back and optimise again, wasting time in a way.</p> <p>Obviously the game needs to be playable even in early testing, so you can&#39;t expect players to test on 3fps, but as a general rule of thumb, would a company optimise a game when stuff is still be changed drastically?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Talents"> /u/Talents </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksb1w1/how_does_optimisation_work/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksb1w1/how_does_optimisation_work/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1k4kgit/ill_play_your_game_and_promote_it_on_tiktok_for/">post</a> last month on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/">r/IndieDev</a> about a challenge I&#39;d be doing to play indie games daily and make TikToks about them. I&#39;m a software guy, so this was both to help me learn game marketing but also to give back to the community that I&#39;ve learnt so much from.</p> <p>Since then, I&#39;ve picked up 85k likes, 1.5k followers, and one viral video (500k+ views). I wanted to share some of the things that worked for me, what works for other studios, and just general tips (with some examples) </p> <p>1)Relatability &gt; Everything</p> <p>Everyone says you need wild visuals or shocking hooks and those definitely help, but the best hooks feel scarily accurate to the viewer. Instead of making a generalized statement, say something that feels niche. If the video is targeting you, why would you scroll?</p> <p>The Magus Circle does a great job of being relatable with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lekevdev/video/7472352015893400863">this hook</a>. He immediately gives context about the game, asks a relatable question, then puts himself in the viewers shoes. Super effective.</p> <p>2) Quantity &gt;= Quality</p> <p>This might be a hot take but medium-effort videos daily is infinitely better than high-effort ones weekly. Every post is a lottery ticket with a brand new audience. Unless you&#39;re already big, 99% of viewers have never seen you before so shots on goal matter the most.</p> <p>Landfall is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@landfallgames">killing it on TikTok</a> and they do an awesome job of posting consistently. One trick they use is responding to comments for easy posts. If you don&#39;t get comments, just tell your friends to (fake it till you make it, duh).</p> <p>3) Storytelling really is the new meta</p> <p>Good videos take the viewer on a journey, even if they&#39;re only 20-30 seconds. A simple way you can do this is instead of listing features, like &quot;We have this, and this, and this&quot;, you should use the word &quot;but&quot;.</p> <p>&quot;We added this new boss... BUT it broke everything&quot;<br/> &quot;You can pet the dog... BUT it might bite back&quot;</p> <p>Storytelling keeps people watching, and watch time is the best metric. Aim for 11+ seconds average watch time. This small change made a huge difference to the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jestr.gg/video/7505143514863291703">quality of my scripts</a> but please don&#39;t count the number of times I say &quot;but&quot;...</p> <p>4) Some small quick tips<br/> - YouTube Shorts &gt; TikTok for system-heavy or static games<br/> - Fill the full 9:16 screen if you can, but black bars are fine (don&#39;t stress about this)<br/> - You don&#39;t need to chase trends, just post engaging content<br/> - Asking for followers is underrated, TikTok pushes videos that convert followers<br/> - Engage 15-20 min/day (comment, like, follow). Keeps your account warm and grows your audience<br/> - Audios only somewhat matter, just make sure it feels relevant<br/> - Ignore retention %, just focus on 11s+ watch time<br/> - TikTok is super geo-sensitive, don&#39;t share personal accounts unless you live in the same area (shadowbans are a pain)</p> <p>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now and I&#39;m still learning every day, so take this advice with a grain of salt. If you&#39;re a studio doing short form content marketing, I&#39;d love to chat so DM me if you found this post useful! Would love to know what&#39;s working for you guys as well :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/addit02"> /u/addit02 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksagxx/what_ive_learned_about_short_form_video_marketing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ksagxx/what_ive_learned_about_short_form_video_marketing/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ks8wr4/i_quit_my_job_last_month_to_work_on_my_space/" target="_blank">I quit my job last month to work on my space bending puzzle platformer full time. Here's my story.</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on my puzzle-platformer, Compress(space), part-time for the last 1.5 years. I recently quit my job to work on it full-time. Now that I&#39;ve managed to release the Steam page and trailer, I would like to share my journey.</p> <h1>How it began:</h1> <p>Compress(space) began as an entry to the Ludum Dare 54 jam(2023) with the theme &quot;Limited space&quot;. After a failed first day, I procrastinated and watched the currently airing show &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;. A single moment in a single episode in that show inspired the core mechanic, space folding. Instead of being limited <em>by</em> space, you were the one putting limits <em>on</em> space. I instantly felt the potential and somehow finished the game by myself in the remaining 2 days.</p> <p><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/compressspace/">Compress(space) did well on the jam</a>, 10th in the innovation category and 71st overall. It was my best-performing game jam entry. My previous game, Control:Override also began as a game jam entry(GMTK 2020). But I could feel that the scale would be different in this one.</p> <h1>How I got here:</h1> <p>After the jam, I had to go back to reality, my day job. But I kept plugging away at Compress(space). I worked on it every weekend and every paid leave I could muster. I <a href="https://b-deshidev.itch.io/compressspace-expanded">uploaded builds on Itch</a> and playtested and playtested.</p> <p>Feedback was promising. I could prototype very quickly in the minimal artstyle I had chosen. I tested out a lot of mechanics and quickly realized that the space folding mechanic could easily be expanded into a full game. My mind was filled with possibilities. I wanted to work on it full-time.</p> <p>But funding was an issue. My parents had retired and there was pressure on me to keep my stable(if low paycheck). I could safely work on the game if I had a publisher. But 2024 was a very rough year for funding. Finding a publishing deal on top of that for a puzzle platformer would be tough. </p> <p>I decided it was too risky to rely on just publishers. I applied for a few but also looked at other funding options such as grants (outersloth, GDOC expo, several puzzle game-focused grants). I applied to all of them. But the one I focused on was the <a href="https://grants.draknek.org/">Draknek New Voices Grant</a></p> <p>I&#39;m from Bangladesh. That&#39;s not a country whose name you&#39;ll hear in gamedev spheres. That&#39;s natural as there is not much of a gamedev industry here. Yet when I went to the grant&#39;s page, I saw people from India, Pakistan, Jamaica, and many other places. Countries that you wouldn&#39;t normally associate with gamedev. I felt a kinship with these people whose faces I had never seen, from countries I&#39;d never even get to visit. It lit a fire in me. I applied for all the paid leave I had all at once before the submission period. I did all I could to finish the demo and submitted.</p> <p>Months passed. 2024 was almost over. None of the grants or publishers I had applied to had replied. One of them even got canceled. Then at the end of the year, I was informed that I was selected for the Draknek New Voices grant. It was a life-changing moment for me. But actually quitting my job was... a hard and lengthy process. But at the end of this May, I finally quit.</p> <p>And now, I&#39;m here. My game finally has a Steam page. A trailer I can be proud of. And a story I&#39;m glad to share.</p> <h1>Addressing the elephant in the room:</h1> <p>Leaving my personal story aside, I realize that &quot;quit my job&quot; and &quot;puzzle platformer&quot; are probably trigger words in this community at this point. However, in this case, I&#39;d like to point out that:</p> <ol> <li>The jam version did well in Ludum Dare. People wanted more and the design space felt big enough to expand. This implied that there was a demand for this game despite being a puzzle platformer.</li> <li>This is my second commercial puzzle game. The design approach (breaking mechanics in weird ways) is how I approached my previous game as well. I never doubted that I could execute the game&#39;s mechanics.</li> <li>I live in a 3rd world country. That grant covers a good portion of my development costs(but I&#39;ll likely need additional funding for the full game). Without that runway, this would be a much harder decision.</li> <li>If you look at the popular puzzle games from the last few years(Superliminal, Viewfinder, Patrick&#39;s Parabox), they are all able to convey their core gimmick visually very quickly in an appealing way. While the space compression mechanic is not in the same league, it is still very GIFable. I felt that as long as I could juice the core mechanic, the game would be able to overcome the puzzle platformer marketing hurdle. And juice I did. Screenshake. Particles. Post Processing. Shaders. I applied everything I knew to bring out the best of the folding mechanic.</li> </ol> <p>I don&#39;t know if I succeeded in that. Perhaps I will know when the steam traffic report comes tomorrow.</p> <p>Takeaways:</p> <ol> <li>Iterate and validate concepts quickly by doing game jams. Use itch to host a playable build to get feedback. You don&#39;t need a Steam page to playtest.</li> <li>Delay spending time/money on art as long as possible to be able to iterate quickly and keep costs down.</li> <li>Don&#39;t quit your job without a runway. Please.</li> <li>Try out different funding methods if publishers don&#39;t work out.</li> <li>Name your game something that is searchable. I&#39;m deeply regretting my decision to call it Compress(space).</li> </ol> <p>That&#39;s all. I hope this story inspired you to continue working on your own games. I&#39;m not linking the game here due to subreddit rules.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Krons-sama"> /u/Krons-sama </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ks8wr4/i_quit_my_job_last_month_to_work_on_my_space/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ks8wr4/i_quit_my_job_last_month_to_work_on_my_space/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>My team and I are about to release our next game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714620/Duck_Detective_The_Ghost_of_Glamping/">Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping</a> tomorrow 22nd May, and I wanted to share with you all some data and &quot;pre-mortem&quot; thoughts about releasing a sequel to a game within 1 year of the first one releasing!</p> <p>I did a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1cwlf2s/we_got_over_60k_wishlists_in_6_months_this_is_how/">post like this last year</a> for the original Duck Detective, and it helped distract me from being nervous so I&#39;m back again</p> <p><strong>The TL;DR:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>People still really love ducks</strong></li> <li><strong>We got very lucky the first time (and not as lucky this time)</strong></li> <li><strong>TikTok not converting as well as last year for us</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>1. The Wishlist Data</strong></p> <p>The first game had 76k wishlists on release, the sequel is going to end up on ~60k wishlists (currently on 59k+). So a 16k wishlist difference is pretty large, over 20% difference.</p> <p><a href="https://allthebees.de/sequel-announcement-learnings/">I wrote in December</a> how the new game actually had a faster wishlist velocity here on Steam page release, almost double in the 1st week. So what happened? We think, our core fans are showing up to support us early, but it&#39;s been harder to convince new people to check out the game.</p> <p>Our demo plays on Steam also reflect this. The first game had 36.7k downloads and 17.5k plays. The sequel has 17k downloads and 9k plays. Around half the amount.</p> <p>It&#39;s been harder promoting a sequel compared to the original idea. One reason is how our messaging is more cluttered. We found using the word sequel performed pretty badly, so we&#39;ve avoided that messaging where we can.</p> <p>It&#39;s not to say it&#39;s bad by any measure for our small team - we just have these data that we can compare to.</p> <p><strong>2. Ducks are sometimes lucky</strong></p> <p>Last year, we got phenomenally lucky with our promotion efforts. We managed to get into a bunch of events and even a Nintendo Showcase. It was really incredible, and gave us loads of attention that we just weren&#39;t as lucky to secure again. Every one of those opportunities converted into at least a couple thousand wishlists, and it really added up. This time around, things have just been different. It feels like people are more focused on Switch 2 news than games coming to Switch 1. Event showcases with Steam sales pages have been cemented as a good wishlist tool, and so it&#39;s much much more competitive to get into these showcases (and also Steam is more saturated with events).</p> <p>I also want to point out how the game will only show up in Popular Upcoming on the Steam front page for a few hours before release. Only 10 games can show up on this list, and due to the huge number of games that release each day on Steam, we sit in slot number 12 for May 22nd games. We were in a similar situation last year, but we like to release later in the day. We know Thursday is a very popular day to release, but if you can ride your way into New &amp; Trending over the weekend, that&#39;s much better than sitting in Popular Upcoming for an extra day.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t expect us to be as lucky with the sequel marketing this year, but I&#39;m still always amazed at the speed that marketing best practices shift. It&#39;s a constantly changing environment and we need to always be looking for cool new opportunities.</p> <p><strong>3. TikTok is an enigma</strong></p> <p>On top of this, last year, we also found TikTok to be a huge platform for our promotion. We were at a point leading up to release were videos would consistently get 20k views or higher, and could actively see hundreds of wishlists pouring in from TikTok. This time around, TikTok has not been working in our favour. If a video got ~1000 views in 20 mins last year, we knew that would get us at least 100k views within 48 hours. Now, videos are hitting ~1000 views in 20 mins and then they just stop going any higher. We&#39;re not really sure why, but TikTok has always been mysterious to us, so we can&#39;t really make any conclusions about it.</p> <p>We&#39;ve also been trying some new things this time around. We&#39;re trying some paid Reddit Ads right now, and I&#39;ll try share outcomes of that once we have more data post-release!</p> <p>With all of this in mind: How well do you think Duck Detective: The Ghost of Glamping will do tomorrow?</p> <p>I&#39;m interested to hear people&#39;s opinions</p> <p>Hopefully this is useful to some people!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some OpenAPI tools (e.g., oapi-codegen) expect you to implement a specific interface like:</p> <p><code>go type ServerInterface interface { GetHello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) } </code></p> <p>Then your handler usually hangs off this server struct that has all the dependencies.</p> <p>```go type MyServer struct { logger *log.Logger ctx context.Context }</p> <p>func (s *MyServer) GetHello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // use s.logger, s.ctx, etc. } ```</p> <p>This works in a small application but causes coupling in larger ones.</p> <ul> <li><code>MyServer</code> needs to live in the same package as the <code>GetHello</code> handler.</li> <li>Do we redefine <code>MyServer</code> in each different package when we need to define handlers in different packages?</li> <li>You end up with one massive struct full of deps even if most handlers only need one or two of them.</li> </ul> <p>Another <a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2024/02/09/how-i-write-http-services-in-go-after-13-years/#:%7E:text=">pattern</a>%0A%09%7D%0A%7D-,Maker%20funcs%20return%20the%20handler,-My%20handler%20functions&gt;) that works well is wrapping the handler in a function that explicitly takes in the dependencies, uses them in a closure, and returns a handler. Like this:</p> <p><code>go func helloHandler(ctx context.Context, logger *log.Logger) http.Handler { return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { logger.Println(&quot;handling request&quot;) w.Write([]byte(&quot;hello&quot;)) }) } </code></p> <p>That way you can define handlers wherever you want, inject only what they need, and avoid having to group everything under one big server struct.

Recently, while learning the concurrency model of Go language, I have been very interested in its idea of &quot;Do not communicate by sharing memory&quot; (instant, share memory by communication).The channel mechanism of Go replaces explicit locks with data transfer between goroutines, making concurrent programming safer and simpler. This makes me think: can similar ideas be used in operating system design? For example, replacing traditional IPC mechanisms such as shared memory and semaphore with channels?I would like to discuss the following points with everyone:The inter process/thread communication (IPC) of the operating system currently relies on shared memory, message queues, pipelines, and so on. What are the advantages and challenges of using a mechanism similar to Go channel?Will performance become a bottleneck (such as system call overhead)?Realistic case:Have any existing operating systems or research projects attempted this design? (For example, microkernel, Unikernel, or certain academic systems?)?

I‚Äôd like to push it beyond pet-project status, so any sharp edges you spot now will help a ton.</p> <p>Repo ‚Üí <a href="https://github.com/riverset/rate-limiter-go">https://github.com/riverset/rate-limiter-go</a></p> <h1>What‚Äôs in there right now</h1> <ul> <li>Algorithms <ul> <li>Token Bucket</li> <li>Fixed-Window Counter</li> <li>Sliding-Window Counter</li> </ul></li> <li>Back-ends <ul> <li>In-memory (good for local dev / single instance)</li> <li>Redis (Lua scripts for atomic ops)</li> <li>Memcache is on the TODO list.</li> </ul></li> <li>Config-first bootstrap</li> </ul> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>limiters, closer, err := api.NewLimitersFromConfigPath(&quot;./config.yaml&quot;) allowed, err := limiters[&quot;login&quot;].Allow(ctx, userID) defer closer.Close() </code></pre> <ul> <li>Extras ‚Äì YAML config, graceful shutdown via io.Closer, and stubs for metrics / middleware hooks.</li> </ul> <h1>Eyes needed on</h1> <ol> <li>Public API feel Does the NewLimitersFromConfigPath ‚Üí map[string]Limiter pattern read clean, or would explicit constructors per algorithm be clearer?</li> <li>Extensibility wishlist Leaky Bucket and Memcache are on my roadmap.
