            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Firstly, this post will definitely not be as useful or informative as those like “My game made $XXk”, which I admire and aim for. That said, my journey hasn&#39;t been proven successful yet, so this might not be as convincing.</p> <p>FYI, I quit my job 6 months ago and have been working on my first indie game. I just want to write down my journey before I release my game so that I actually have a record to look back on for the later “successful” postmortem like others have done.</p> <p><strong>My Routine</strong></p> <p><strong>The daily routine actually starts the night before.</strong> I always write down my TODOs for the next day. Personally, I consider it important to limit the number of tasks to under 5~6, and also sort them by priority.</p> <p>After a good 8 hours of sleep, I wake up at 6:30 and immediately start working on the first TODO I wrote last night. I keep working till 10:30 and then go to the gym for 1.5 hours, <strong>by which time I should have finished at least the most important task, if not more.</strong> <em>(I exercise no less than 5 times a week, which really helps me refresh and not burn myself out).</em></p> <p>The rest of the day is nothing special—just working on the remaining tasks. Before I go to bed, I always try very hard not to skip the “Summary &amp; Planning” part. (I do skip this part once a week or two, trying not to push myself too hard lol).</p> <p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p> <p>Since I am new to indie game dev, I feel like I have gone through a lot of trial and error regarding what really matters to increase the odds of success. So far, I have reached the following two conclusions:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Have a deadline for release.</strong> At the beginning, I only had a very opaque deadline, but since setting a hard date, it helped me clarify what is lacking in my game and what should be prioritized. (Warning: the deadline actually puts a lot of pressure on me, though).</li> <li><strong>Learn marketing.</strong> I am still learning and experimenting with marketing, trying out the advice I read from other &quot;postmortem&quot; posts. (This can be controversial, but I personally decided not to have a publisher this time since I want to actually learn marketing myself, and I feel like <em>I should be the one who knows my game’s unique selling point best</em>).</li> </ol> <p>Thanks for reading this &quot;Mid-mortem&quot; post. I hope I can soon link this back in my future “how I succeeded in my first indie game” postmortem. If you have any advice or feedback, I&#39;d love to hear it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Curious-Gaby"> /u/Curious-Gaby </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qgerqs/not_a_postmortem_but_a_midmortem_for_my_wip_indie/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qgerqs/not_a_postmortem_but_a_midmortem_for_my_wip_indie/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After keeping my Steam page live for about <strong>2 and a half years</strong>, I just crossed <strong>7,000 wishlists</strong> with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/">my game</a> launching in ~1 week (Jan 26).</p> <p><strong>Three months ago</strong> I was sitting at ~3,500 wishlists. Progress felt painfully slow, and I seriously considered just releasing and moving on.</p> <p>What stopped me was how painful the idea of giving up felt. I <strong>love</strong> this project. Too much work went into it, and too many players had already shown genuine appreciation for the game to justify giving up on the promotion side.</p> <p>So I gave promotion one more real try. I reached out to YouTubers again to showcase my demo, accepted silence, and kept going. This time I put real effort into it: better-formatted emails, clearer pitches, improved Reddit posts, and more care overall. Some videos landed. Some didn’t. <strong>But the ones that did changed everything.</strong></p> <p>It was uncomfortable, time-consuming, and draining. But it worked. The game is now gaining many more wishlists on a daily basis and it&#39;s in the Popular Upcoming list (since I hit 5.5k wishlists).</p> <p>What I wanna say is: if you believe the project is good, don’t stop at “I made the game”.<br/> Promotion is part of the job, and it deserves <strong>as much care as the game itself</strong>. That’s something I truly started doing only in the last three months.</p> <p>I did a lot of mistakes as it&#39;s my first title for PC, but I am still giving it my best and I am super excited for the release :)</p> <p>For those curious, here’s the Steam page to my game:<br/> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352670/Arcadium__Space_Odyssey/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Particular4116"> /u/Odd_Particular4116 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qgcknc/i_finally_hit_the_famous_7k_steam_wishlists_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qgcknc/i_finally_hit_the_famous_7k_steam_wishlists_after/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I started as an art director and I&#39;m now working as a full time producer and art director. Looking for publishers and investors is taking 95% of my time :(</p> <p>Things are tough for us devs since the post-Covid. Are you guys managing to get any funds for your games? Did you get to sign a publishing deal lately?</p> <p>I&#39;ve managed to secure partners and funding for all my previous games, the most recent one being Tiny Garden (published alongside with Super Rare Originals) but I&#39;m struggling doing so with my latest ones. The worst part is trying to keep the team together and paying decent salaries. These guys are the best and we know super smoothly as a team but we&#39;re lacking this external validation factor that&#39;s crucial to make a living out of this in the long term. I know we&#39;re doing our part super good, so it&#39;s even more frustrating than if we were kind of mediocre or if we did not deliver good results.</p> <p>I even have a huge list of publishers, investors and other business agents that I keep updated to stay in touch with the industry state and seeing lots of them closing their businesses, lowering their investment amount, not taking risks anymore... is devastating. </p> <p>How are you all doing, guys? Is there any gold mine around that we&#39;re not aware of? Any source of funding we didn&#39;t explore? Do you recommend starting a Ko-Fi or a Patreon to a small studio like ours?</p> <p>Stay strong everybody!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oluwagembi"> /u/oluwagembi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qg8bfi/getting_to_fund_an_indie_game_nowadays_is_harder/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qg8bfi/getting_to_fund_an_indie_game_nowadays_is_harder/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I still don&#39;t fully understand the implications of this but something smells</li> <li>the code generated by sqlc made it so that all the database logic was mixed in the same files. <code>internal/adapters/postgresql/sqlc/models.go</code> has the type declarations for both products and orders same for <code>queries.sql.go</code> . That just seems wrong to me.</li> </ol> <p>So I went to chat gpt and asked it those questions, it gave me some advice that I partially understood.</p> <p>for the first question (and it kinda solves all) it told me that the api.go file was in fact overloaded with things that it shouldn&#39;t be responsible for. creating services, handlers, registering routes and wiring deps. So it suggested that all that should be done on each package and api.go should only call a method that executes it. You can see it in the link to my repo but it looks something like this</p> <pre><code>// api.go products.RegisterRoutes(r, products.Deps{ Repo: deps.Repos.Products, }) //products/routes.go func RegisterRoutes(r chi.Router, deps Deps) { service := NewService(deps.Repo) handler := NewHandler(service) r.Get(&quot;/products&quot;, handler.ListProducts) r.Get(&quot;/products/{id}&quot;, handler.FindProductByID) } </code></pre> <p>However this created a new set of issues, <code>NewService</code> originally expected a <code>repo.Querier</code> but i was sending a <code>Repository</code> with different function names (which are more semantic according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1dezksp/comment/l8frc4a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this</a>?) this caused a whole set of refactor that ended up on something that I don&#39;t think should be this complicated. </p> <p>Again, full details are on the link I added to my repo, but chatgpt ended up creating this under <code>internal/adapters/postgresql/products_repository.go</code> </p> <pre><code>type ProductsRepository struct { q *repo.Queries } func NewProductsRepository(q *repo.Queries) *ProductsRepository { return &amp;ProductsRepository{q: q} } func (r *ProductsRepository) List(ctx context.Context) ([]products.Product, error) { rows, err := r.q.ListProducts(ctx) if err != nil { return nil, err } res := make([]products.Product, 0, len(rows)) for _, p := range rows { res = append(res, products.Product{ ID: p.ID, Name: p.Name, Price: int64(p.PriceInCents), }) } return res, nil } func (r *ProductsRepository) FindById(ctx context.Context, id int64) (products.Product, error) { p, err := r.q.FindProductByID(ctx, id) if err != nil { return products.Product{}, err } return products.Product{ ID: p.ID, Name: p.Name, Price: int64(p.PriceInCents), }, nil } </code></pre> <p>My question with all this is, is this adapter really needed? why are we introducing so much logic in the database side? didn&#39;t we use sqlc exactly to avoid writing all of this? I then would have to write logic in a lot of places every time I add a new package or even a new method for a package. </p> <p>I know this is a really long post and it requires a lot of context from the 2 repos I linked, however any help would be greatly appreciated, as well as some guidance on more resources to continue learning :)</p> <p>thank you all</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Playful-Brief-3286"> /u/Playful-Brief-3286 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qgsdid/vibe_learning_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qgsdid/vibe_learning_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a> community,</p> <p>Some of you might remember <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nqfe74/solving_slow_postgresql_tests_in_large_go/">my post from a few months back</a> about speeding up PostgreSQL tests using template databases. In this sub-reddit and other places, developers have commented on their use cases and I am grateful for the feedback I have received.</p> <p>A common theme in the comments was about migration tooling: many of you use libraries like <code>goose</code>, <code>golang-migrate</code> or <code>Atlas</code> in production and wanted to keep using them in tests without extra overhead. I&#39;m glad to share that <code>pgdbtemplate</code> now natively supports these libraries through dedicated adapters. This means you do not have to write custom migration runners, while you still get the speed of template databases.</p> <h1>What&#39;s new</h1> <p>Just plug in your preferred migration runner:</p> <p><strong>1. For</strong> <code>goose</code></p> <pre><code>import pgdbtemplategoose &quot;github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate-goose&quot; runner := pgdbtemplategoose.NewMigrationRunner(os.DirFS(&quot;./migrations&quot;)) </code></pre> <p><strong>2. For</strong> <code>golang-migrate</code></p> <pre><code>import pgdbtemplategolangmigrate &quot;github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate-golang-migrate&quot; runner := pgdbtemplategolangmigrate.NewMigrationRunner(&quot;./migrations&quot;) </code></pre> <p><strong>3. For</strong> <code>Atlas</code></p> <pre><code>import pgdbtemplateatlas &quot;github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate-atlas&quot; runner := pgdbtemplateatlas.NewMigrationRunner(&quot;./migrations&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Each adapter respects the original library&#39;s functionality and provides configuration parameters for flexibility.</p> <h1>What this solves</h1> <p>If you have ever run tests against PostgreSQL with complex schemas, you&#39;ve likely seen how slow it is to run migrations before each test. The template approach solves this by running them once on a template database and then re-using it for all test databases, with consistent creation times and full test isolation.</p> <p>In our benchmarks with complex schemas (5+ tables), the template approach is ~50% faster than running migrations per test. For 200 test databases, that&#39;s a reduction from ~9.2 seconds to ~5.8 seconds. The new migration adapters maintain that speed while simplifying your existing workflow.</p> <h1>Get started</h1> <pre><code>go get github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate go get github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate-pgx # or pq go get github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate-goose # or atlas/golang-migrate </code></pre> <p>Define the template manager in your <code>TestMain</code>:</p> <pre><code>provider := pgdbtemplatepgx.NewConnectionProvider(...) runner := pgdbtemplategoose.NewMigrationRunner(migrationsFS) config := pgdbtemplate.Config{ ConnectionProvider: provider, MigrationRunner: runner, } tm, _ := pgdbtemplate.NewTemplateManager(config) tm.Initialize(ctx) defer tm.Cleanup(ctx) </code></pre> <p>Each test gets its own isolated database:</p> <pre><code>func TestUserRepo(t *testing.T) { db, dbName, _ := tm.CreateTestDatabase(ctx) defer tm.DropTestDatabase(ctx, dbName) // Continue with a fresh, migrated database... } </code></pre> <p>The library is minimal, extensible and thread-safe. It works with both <code>pgx/v5</code> and <code>database/sql</code> Go drivers, as well as supports <code>testcontainers-go</code>. <code>pgdbtemplate</code> has been tested in the enterprise on systems with billing and contracting schemas (dozens of tables and thousands of tests).</p> <p><strong>Github</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate">github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate</a></p> <p>Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual_Tutor_647"> /u/Individual_Tutor_647 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qg268x/speeding_up_postgresql_tests_in_go_now_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qg268x/speeding_up_postgresql_tests_in_go_now_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Today, with rtc v0.8.0, we&#39;ve reached full feature parity with the async-based webrtc crate and comprehensive W3C WebRTC API compliance.</p> <h1>What&#39;s New Since v0.3.0?</h1> <p>When we announced v0.3.0, we mentioned that Simulcast support and RTCP feedback handling (Interceptors) were still in progress. Those are now complete, along with several other features:</p> <ul> <li>Interceptor Framework – NACK generator/responder, Sender/Receiver reports, TWCC sender/receiver, Simulcast with RID/MID extensions</li> <li>mDNS Support – Privacy-preserving ICE candidates with .local hostnames</li> <li>W3C Stats API – Full getStats() implementation with StatsSelector for selective queries</li> <li>Enhanced Simulcast – First-class support for multiple RTP encodings per track</li> </ul> <h1>Current Status</h1> <p>The rtc crate now has feature parity with the async webrtc crate:</p> <ul> <li>✅ ICE (Host, SRFLX, Relay, Trickle ICE, ICE-TCP, mDNS)</li> <li>✅ DTLS 1.2 with certificate fingerprints</li> <li>✅ SRTP with AES-CM and AES-GCM cipher suites</li> <li>✅ SCTP for reliable &amp; unreliable data channels</li> <li>✅ RTP/RTCP with full header extension support</li> <li>✅ Interceptors (NACK, RTX, TWCC, SR/RR, Simulcast)</li> <li>✅ W3C WebRTC Stats API</li> <li>✅ Full Peer Connection API (offer/answer, tracks, data channels, events)</li> </ul> <h1>Quick Refresher: Why Sans-I/O?</h1> <p>For those new to the project, the sans-I/O pattern means protocol logic is completely decoupled from networking, threads, or async runtimes:</p> <pre><code>// You control the I/O loop - works with any runtime or no runtime let mut pc = RTCPeerConnection::new(config)?; // SDP offer/answer exchange via signaling // ... loop { // Send outgoing packets while let Some(msg) = pc.poll_write() { socket.send_to(&amp;msg.message, msg.transport.peer_addr)?; } // Handle events (connection state, tracks, data channels) while let Some(event) = pc.poll_event() { match event { RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnConnectionStateChangeEvent(state) =&gt; { println!(&quot;Connection state: {state}&quot;); } RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnTrack(RTCTrackEvent::OnOpen(init)) =&gt; { println!(&quot;New track: {}&quot;, init.track_id); } _ =&gt; {} } } // Handle incoming messages (RTP, RTCP, data channel) while let Some(message) = pc.poll_read() { // Process RTP packets, data channel messages, etc. } // Feed incoming network data let (n, peer_addr) = socket.recv_from(&amp;mut buf)?; pc.handle_read(TaggedBytesMut { ... })?; // Handle timeouts for retransmissions/keepalives pc.handle_timeout(Instant::now())?; } </code></pre> <p>This gives you runtime independence, deterministic testing, and full control over your event loop.</p> <p>Check the Examples README for working code demonstrating how to use the sansio RTC API with event loops for different WebRTC use-cases: <a href="https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc/blob/master/examples/examples/README.md">https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc/blob/master/examples/examples/README.md</a></p> <p>The examples cover:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data Channels</strong>: bidirectional messaging, flow control, offer/answer between two rtc instances</li> <li><strong>Media</strong>: play from disk (VP8/VP9/H264/H265/AV1), save to disk, broadcast, simulcast, RTP/RTCP forwarding, track swapping, insertable streams (E2E encryption)</li> <li><strong>ICE/Connectivity</strong>: mDNS privacy, ICE restart, Trickle ICE, ICE-TCP (passive &amp; active modes)</li> <li><strong>Stats</strong>: W3C WebRTC statistics collection and monitoring</li> </ul> <h1>What&#39;s Next?</h1> <p>With feature parity achieved, our focus shifts to four key areas:</p> <ul> <li>🔄 Browser Interoperability – Comprehensive testing with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We&#39;re building automated browser test infrastructure.</li> <li>🔄 Performance Engineering – Benchmarking with criterion, profiling hot paths, optimizing DataChannel throughput (target: &gt;500 Mbps reliable, &gt;1 Gbps unreliable) and RTP pipeline latency.</li> <li>🔄 Test Coverage – Expanding unit tests toward 80%+ coverage, adding integration scenarios, and fuzz testing for all packet parsers.</li> <li>🔄 Code Quality – Cleaning up 104 TODO/FIXME comments, improving rustdoc coverage, and refining APIs based on user feedback.</li> </ul> <h1>Get Involved</h1> <p>We welcome contributions at all levels:</p> <ul> <li>Good first issues: Documentation, unit tests, simple TODO cleanups</li> <li>Intermediate: Integration test scenarios, benchmark implementations</li> <li>Advanced: Performance optimizations, new interceptors, protocol extensions</li> </ul> <h1>Links:</h1> <ul> <li>Blog Post: <a href="https://webrtc.rs/blog/2026/01/18/rtc-feature-complete-whats-next.html">https://webrtc.rs/blog/2026/01/18/rtc-feature-complete-whats-next.html</a></li> <li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc">https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc</a></li> <li>Examples: <a href="https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc/blob/master/examples/examples/README.md">https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc/blob/master/examples/examples/README.md</a></li> <li>Crate: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rtc">https://crates.io/crates/rtc</a></li> <li>Docs: <a href="https://docs.rs/rtc">https://docs.rs/rtc</a></li> <li>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/4Ju8UHdXMs">https://discord.gg/4Ju8UHdXMs</a></li> <li>Main Project: <a href="https://webrtc.rs/">https://webrtc.rs/</a></li> </ul> <p>Questions and feedback are very welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Excitement-67"> /u/Hungry-Excitement-67 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qghitd/project_update_rtc_080_feature_complete_whats/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qghitd/project_update_rtc_080_feature_complete_whats/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Version 0.1.0 of Rustorio is now up on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustorio">crates.io</a>!</p> <p>The first game written <em>and played</em> entirely in Rust&#39;s type system (well almost). Not just do you play by writing Rust code, the rules of the game are enforced by the Rust compiler! If you can write the program so it compiles and doesn&#39;t panic, you win!</p> <p>A while ago I realized that with Rust&#39;s affine types and ownership, it was possible to simulate resource scarcity. Combined with the richness of the type system, I wondered if it was possible to create a game with the rules enforced entirely by the Rust compiler. Well, it looks like it is.</p> <p>The actual mechanics are heavily inspired by Factorio and similar games, but you play by filling out a function, and if it compiles and doesn&#39;t panic, you&#39;ve won! As an example, in the tutorial level, you start with <a href="https://docs.rs/rustorio/latest/rustorio/gamemodes/struct.TutorialStartingResources.html">10 iron</a></p> <pre><code>fn user_main(mut tick: Tick, starting_resources: StartingResources) -&gt; (Tick, Bundle&lt;Copper, 1&gt;) { let StartingResources { iron } = starting_resources; </code></pre> <p>You can use this to create a <a href="https://docs.rs/rustorio/latest/rustorio/buildings/struct.Furnace.html"><code>Furnace</code></a> to turn copper ore (which you get by using <a href="https://docs.rs/rustorio/latest/rustorio/fn.mine_copper.html"><code>mine_copper</code></a>) into copper.</p> <pre><code> let mut furnace = Furnace::build(&amp;tick, IronSmelting, iron); let copper_ore = rustorio::mine_copper::&lt;8&gt;(&amp;mut tick); furnace.add_input(&amp;tick, copper_ore); tick.advance_until(|tick| furnace.cur_output(tick) &gt; 0, 100); </code></pre> <p>Because none of these types implement <code>Copy</code> or <code>Clone</code> and because they all have hidden fields, the only way (I hope) to create them is through the use of other resources, or in the case of ore, <a href="https://docs.rs/rustorio/latest/rustorio/struct.Tick.html">time</a>.</p> <h1>New features</h1> <ul> <li>Revamped recipe system. Recipes and technologies are now defined using macros, allowing much more variation and stuff like automatic and standardized documentation. Many thanks to palimpsest for implementing most of the proc-macros. I&#39;d never worked with them before so I don&#39;t know if I would have gotten it done without their help.</li> <li>Territories. Some people mentioned that optimizing the game was kinda pointless when you were limited by hand mining ores anyway. This has now changed! You can still hand mine the territories to start, but to scale you can add miners to the territories to automate the process.</li> <li>Scale. You now need 200 points to win the game, and points require not iron and copper, but circuits and steel. Together these should give you much more to optimize on.</li> </ul> <h1>Next steps</h1> <p><strong>Playtesting</strong>: This is not so much a task for the developers, but for <strong>you</strong>. The game is now at a point where I wanna start focusing on the actual, you know, gameplay. This means that any and all feedback on this point is incredibly valuable, whether it&#39;s a pain point or something you enjoy. I&#39;d even love to see your entire playthrough to get a picture of the things people get up to. Rustorio has a unique user interface for a game so we have to reinvent a lot of game design from scratch which means playtesting is essential. So please do leave a comment here, send me a DM or join the <a href="https://discord.gg/uKJugp85Fk">Discord</a>.</p> <p>Other than that I&#39;m considering setting up an official leaderboard where players can submit playthroughs that is then run and ranked on how few ticks they take.</p> <p>I&#39;m also looking into supporting subfactories. This brings quite a few interesting technical difficulties and I think it&#39;s essential for making more complex gameplay a good experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PenguinAgen"> /u/PenguinAgen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/albertsgarde/rustorio">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qgdjy9/rustorio_v010_using_rusts_type_system_as_a_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve created (NOT vibe-coded) an aliasing/keybind plugin for Zsh (and maybe other shells in future), which allows you to create customizable leader-key combos and project-specific keybinds to run commands. It&#39;s called <code>blaze-keys</code> (or <code>blz</code>). </p> <p>The teaser demo here shows the leader-key functionality, but <code>blz</code> also makes it easier to define top-level keybinds, and they can automatically reassign when you <code>cd</code> between projects. For example, you could assign F8 so it always runs the build command, which would change from <code>cargo build</code> to <code>uv build</code> depending on the working directory. The longer demo is here: <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/765747">https://asciinema.org/a/765747</a>.</p> <p><code>blz</code> is fundamentally designed to cut out all the unnecessary typing from common commands. I still use <code>fzf</code> and <code>zsh-autosuggestions</code> (which are awesome!), but <code>blz</code> gives me the most optimised keystrokes for common commands. </p> <p>One nice thing about <code>blz</code> is that you don&#39;t need to use the <code>Enter</code> key to run commands: you choose when invoking it whether you want &#39;exec&#39; mode or &#39;abbr&#39; mode. This makes it feel very smooth. </p> <p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/enhanced-primate/blaze-keys">https://github.com/enhanced-primate/blaze-keys</a></p> <p>If anyone&#39;s wondering why the history is short: I started working on this over Christmas 2024, and have been using it since then.

My question is, how do you handle errors in your production code?</p> <p>I feel like for programs, anyhow is usually enough because when you get an error at runtime, you rarely want to actually check the error’s contents and change behaviour based on that. Most of the time you just want log the error, take a step back and continue from there.</p> <p>However, in libraries, that’s where it gets a bit confusing for me. Is it a good idea to use anyhow in libraries? How do you bridge your custom error types with already existing error types from dependencies? What is the best way to define your custom error types? With derive_more? this_error? Something else?</p> <p>I’m pretty much looking for advice, best practices etc in production code mainly, but I guess code from hobby projects would be similar. Thank you</p> <p>EDIT: I&#39;m looking for more technical and particular answers. For example, a link to a blog post or research, or &quot;I worked on X, bumped into problem Y, solved it using Z&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ve seen most people (not) use X&quot; and so on. Answers like &quot;Depends&quot;, &quot;There&#39;s no secret formula&quot;, &quot;You need to add context and make your errors show exactly what it&#39;s useful for your case&quot; contribute to nothing We all know this stuff already.
