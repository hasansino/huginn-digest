            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I been making an indie game and I&#39;m trying to put myself more out there so that people can at least know that my game exists and is being built (planning to release an alpha in 2 months).</p> <p>Since I&#39;m a nobody, I decided to go with youtube shorts. Pretty logical for discoverability. Also tried to avoid Reddit as it is a minefield for self promo, there&#39;s no audience retention and it&#39;s mostly peers.</p> <p>I decided to make daily updates as youtube shorts since I know I make stuff fast and so I&#39;d have enough made to show each day and it would also force me to stay on track and work on my game each day.</p> <p>So the first few shorts, I would just show what I&#39;d make in the day not putting much more thought or effort into it.</p> <p>But audience retention (&#39;&#39;stayed to watch&#39;&#39;) was low, and watch time was also low. And for youtube, if you want your short to land on people&#39;s pages and be watched, you need at least 60% stayed to watch and ideally 80%. (Mines are at 30-40%)</p> <p>So I studied the thing. Binge watched tutorials about youtube shorts. Learned about hooks, inclusivity, plot and so on. Basically how you need to cater the vid to the viewer instead of just showing what you want to show. Making it interesting, intriguing. A little movie condensed in 60secs.</p> <p>And so I tried to make a goddamn MrBeast internet influencer clown of myself. It worked, to some degree, getting 5-15 likes and a couple hundreads of views.</p> <p>But let&#39;s be real. With the time and mental energy I&#39;m pouring on these, I could be working on my game 1.25x faster. And I doubt that in these couple hundreads or thousands of doomscrolling rotting brains will transfer to sales as these people probably aren&#39;t even pc gamers also. The youtube algo is just throwing a bunch of sht everywhere on the wall hoping it&#39;ll stick.</p> <p>And what&#39;s even more frustrating, is that my first two vids got even more views than the latest ones. Though they have less likes. It&#39;s as if youtube&#39;s algo gave me a big push at the start and now is barely showing me.</p> <p>It&#39;s all just so damn confusing. Everyone are giving tips on &#39;&#39;do this or do that&#39;&#39; while the feedback is so long to get and makes absolutely no damn sense most of the time (youtube stats I mean).</p> <p>Like this past whole week I been spending all day trying to think about how to make these damn shorts while making the game. No joke, I find making video games to be 10x easier than making fcking dumbasses youtube shorts. Well in terms of knowing what to do that is.</p> <p>Have you ever gone through this?</p> <p>Since the algo is so unpredictable, should I just stop trying to please it and just make my daily updates and that&#39;s it?</p> <p>Or am I just doing this whole thing wrong?</p> <p>Or should I just cut this sht off, work 60-70 hours on the game, release, get another job, work 60-70 hours and pour everything into paid ads?</p> <p>Because all I want is to make games. I don&#39;t care about all that social media stuff. But I know it&#39;s needed as it significantly increases chances of success for an indie developer. And I am willing to go out of my comfort zone as much as it&#39;s needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight_Season_4500"> /u/Slight_Season_4500 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kvfjsl/how_tf_do_do_you_reach_your_targeted_audience/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kvfjsl/how_tf_do_do_you_reach_your_targeted_audience/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wishlists are very important for visibility and overall sales, but there is no number that will automatically give you an edge. It is often said that you need 8000 or 10000 minimum wishlists before launch for your game to be a success, but I have some counterpoints to that.</p> <p>Not every game can reach those numbers. Those numbers require a lot of investment in marketing, while making a trendy game that does well on social media.</p> <p>According to this wishlist to sales calculator you will make a median of $150k if you have 10k wishlists on launch. Not every game need to make that much money. If you take a year to make a game as a side project and it makes $30k I would consider that very successful, and you can achieve that with 2k wishlists. So you don&#39;t need 8k wishlist you need <strong>as many wishlists as you can get</strong>.</p> <p>It is often mentioned that you need 8k wishlists for your game to appear on steam&#39;s &quot;Popular Upcoming&quot; and &quot;New Releases&quot; lists. I have some qualms with that. You don&#39;t need a specific number to appear on those lists, you need to be on the top of the list. If it becomes common to have 8k wishlists you will need to have considerably more to top it. So you don&#39;t need 8k wishlist you need <strong>as many wishlists as you can get</strong>.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen a bunch of charts about how pre-launch wishlists correlates to sales. If there was a magic number that you should aim for you should be able to see a <strong>step in the graph</strong> at that number of wishlists, but there is no such step.</p> <p>It is clear to me that the amount of pre-launch wishlists correlates to sales. But there is no magic number. If you can get to 2k instead of just 1k that&#39;s a big improvement. If you can get to 16k instead of 8k that is also a proportionally big improvement.</p> <p>So, as I&#39;ve been saying, you don&#39;t need 8k pre-launch wishlist you need <strong>as many wishlists as you can get</strong>.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested to hear your thoughts, specially if you have data to support them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ArcaneThoughts"> /u/ArcaneThoughts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kve4wo/you_dont_need_8000_wishlists_before_launch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kve4wo/you_dont_need_8000_wishlists_before_launch/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For anyone who is excited about joining the June Next Fest, I&#39;ve watched the Q&amp;A about it in the Steamworks channel. These are what I found to be important:</p> <p>1- The first 48 hours is of utmost importance. Everyone is on equal grounds in terms of visibility given by Steam. There is not a lot you can do to get further visibility from Steam.</p> <p>2- After the 48 hours, the recommendation algorithm chooses what game to recommend based on factors such as the amount of wishlists you got in those 48 hours, what tags your game has, what the people that wishlisted your game played previously etc.</p> <p>3- Just to clarify it further, <strong>YOUR TAGS MATTER</strong>. Update them if necessary.</p> <p>4- Your recent wishlist count, the amount of players playing the demo <em>can</em> always be a factor, also in the Next Fest. However, what is best to do is to be sure that your Steam Page and the demo itself is coherent with each other. People want to play what they see in your Store Page, so optimize it as much as you can. You want the impressions to count as much as possible.</p> <p>5- You can have a separate demo page, or don&#39;t. It mostly depends on preference. If you want further feedback on your demo and get reviews on it, go ahead and create a page. If you disable your standalone demo page and enable it again, all the reviews stay as they are.</p> <p>6- Steam does not care about the separate demo page reviews. However, gamers do. Be wary of that.</p> <p>7- If you want your demo to sent out to press by Steam itself, make sure your demo is released before <strong>29th of May</strong>, 10 days before the Next Fest starts.</p> <p>8- Live streaming is not as important as before, so don&#39;t stress over it too much. However, you should still live stream if you have the time for it.</p> <p>9- There will probably be at least a 1000 games in the Next Fest.</p> <p>If you have any other recommendations to give or I&#39;ve missed anything, please do share down below.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love writing UIs in React, but I hate writing business logic in javascript/typescript. I need Rust&#39;s lack of footguns to be productive writing any tricky logic, and I like being closer to the metal because I feel more confident that my code will actually run fast. I have a <a href="https://github.com/not-pizza/victor">vector database</a> and some <a href="https://github.com/wafer-inc/catboost">AI inference code</a> that I use quite often on the web, and it would be a nightmare to write that stuff in Typescript. Also, <code>wasm-bindgen</code> is awesome at generating Typescript annotations for your rust code, and great at keeping your bundle size small by removing everything you don&#39;t use.</p> <p>But for writing UIs, React is just perfect, especially since there&#39;s such a mature ecosystem of components available online.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s a ton of wrong information online on how to start working with this stack, so I realized I should probably share some details on how this works.</p> <p>First, you need to <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/">install wasm-pack</a>. Then, create your rust project with <code>wasm-pack new my-rust-package</code> . Naturally, you <a href="https://vite.dev/guide/">then follow the standard instructions for creating a new vite project</a> (I did this in an adjacent directory).</p> <p>In your vite project, you&#39;ll need to make sure you have `vite-plugin-wasm` and `vite-plugin-top-level-await` enabled to make use of your wasm code:</p> <pre><code>// in file: vite.config.ts import { defineConfig } from &#39;vite&#39; import react from &#39;@vitejs/plugin-react&#39; import wasm from &quot;vite-plugin-wasm&quot;; import topLevelAwait from &quot;vite-plugin-top-level-await&quot;; export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react(), wasm(), topLevelAwait()], }) </code></pre> <p>Once you&#39;ve done that, you can just point at your rust package in your <code>package.json</code>, and add the <code>vite-plugin-top-level-await</code> and <code>vite-plugin-wasm</code> packages in your dev dependencies:</p> <pre><code>// package.json // [...] &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;my-rust-package&quot;: &quot;file:../my-rust-package/pkg&quot;, // add this } &quot;devDependencies&quot;: { &quot;vite-plugin-top-level-await&quot;: &quot;^1.5.0&quot;, // add this &quot;vite-plugin-wasm&quot;: &quot;^3.4.1&quot; // add this } // [...] </code></pre> <p>The pkg folder will be automatically created when you run <code>wasm-pack build</code> inside <code>my-rust-package</code>, which is all you need to do to build it. (For release builds, you should run <code>wasm-pack build --release</code>.) You don&#39;t need to pass any other flags to <code>wasm-pack build</code>. There&#39;s a ton of wrong information about this online lol.</p> <p>Unfortunately, hot module reloading doesn&#39;t quite seem to work with wasm modules, so right now I&#39;m manually reloading the project every time I change the Rust code. Still, it works pretty great and makes me super productive.</p> <p>--------</p> <p><a href="https://chadnauseam.com/coding/tips/rust-and-react">This post has been mirrored to my personal site</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChadNauseam_"> /u/ChadNauseam_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kvge9i/rust_vitereact_is_an_insanely_slick_combination/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kvge9i/rust_vitereact_is_an_insanely_slick_combination/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It solves problems that we didn&#39;t even know we have in <code>c</code> !</p> <p>But can&#39;t help it to avoid thinking that, the <code>borrow checker</code> is kinda enforcing the way we should think, I mean I get it, if borrow checker doesn&#39;t allow it, there is definetly something wrong, but sometimes I&#39;d like to just get passed it! for example : I know i&#39;m not gonna get myself into a <code>race-condition</code> if I have an extra mutable reference!</p> <h1>So my question is,</h1> <p>Lets say we have the following block in c :</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; typedef struct { int age; char *name; } Person; int main() { // ig #[derive(Default)] is default in c Person P1; = &quot;Ada&quot;; P1.age = 30; // and lets get a pointer (mutable refrence) to another Person pointing it to P1 Person *P2; P2 = &amp;P1; // then mutate our heap area from P2 P2-&gt;name = &quot;Leon&quot;; P2-&gt;age = 20; printf(&quot;P1 : name: %s , age : %d \n&quot; , , P1.age); printf(&quot;P2 : name: %s , age : %d \n&quot; , P2-&gt;name , P2-&gt;age); // NOTE: we print P1 first! (ofc in rust we are ending P1&#39;s lifecycle so we leave P2 dangling, hence the compile time err) return 0; }P1.nameP1.name </code></pre> <p>so as you would assume, this program prints :</p> <pre><code>P1 : name: Leon , age : 20 P2 : name: Leon , age : 20 </code></pre> <p>So how do you achieve the same thing in <code>rust</code> ? (keep in mind we want to print out P2 after P1 (printing a a ref borrow after printing from it&#39;s owener)</p> <p>I know it&#39;s the definition of <code>figthing the borrow checker</code> but as I have been proven before, there is always an elegant solution when dealing with low level languages!</p> <p>again, I understand this example is really pointless! and obviously <strong><em>the exact c implementation shouldn&#39;t be possible in rust but what I want to know is can we copy (clone)valueif we borrow areference`</em></strong> !</p> <p>P.S: I know we can clone by value or add a new scope in the middle to fight it using lifecycles, but what I really want to see is a low level solution! after all we have references, they are &quot;pointers to heap areas(sort of!)&quot; and we can read them. so we should be able to get a clone of it on the <code>stack</code></p> <p>P.S. Sorry for the probable! typos, typing on a phone!</p> <p>Edit: my question targets non-primitive types :)</p> <h1>Edit: I&#39;m sorry, apparently the way I put this has caused some confusion (allocating HEAP) !

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>BytePool is a Go library that solves the &quot;don&#39;t know when to release memory&quot; problem through automatic reference counting. It features tiered memory allocation, zero-copy design, and built-in statistics for monitoring memory usage. Perfect for high-concurrency scenarios where manual memory management is challenging.</p> <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/ixugo/bytepool">github.com/ixugo/bytepool</a></p> <p>Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions! üôè</p> <p>**Application scenarios:**<br/> 1. Pushing RTMP to the server with a read coroutine that generates a large number of `[]byte`.<br/> 2. For the data of the above RTMP stream, when users access protocols such as WebRTC/HLS/FLV, three write coroutines are generated.<br/> 3. The RTMP `[]byte` needs to be shared with other coroutines to convert protocols in real-time and write to clients.<br/> 4. This results in multiple goroutines sharing the same read-only `[]byte`.<br/> 5. The above scenarios are derived from the streaming media open-source project lal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent-Tax-6894"> /u/Maleficent-Tax-6894 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kutbxt/bytepool_highperformance_go_memory_pool_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kutbxt/bytepool_highperformance_go_memory_pool_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>
