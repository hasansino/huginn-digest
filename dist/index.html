I&#39;m uncertain how to proceed for the Character Creator demo, and whether or not I should release it as a demo on the game&#39;s main app, or as a separate application, similar to how I&#39;ve seen some games release a &quot;Prologue&quot;. I know that Steam games can only have one Demo.</p> <p>There are so many considerations that are boggling my mind a bit, such as how to min/max steam visibility algorithms like the demo being put into &quot;New and trending&quot; categories, how to funnel wishlists to my main Steam app, etc.</p> <p>Any Steam App experts that may be able to lend their wisdom here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/terminatus"> /u/terminatus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ku06fb/steam_apps_questions_about_releasing_a_character/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ku06fb/steam_apps_questions_about_releasing_a_character/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I joined two years ago when I had the opportunity to help a dear friend produce a MR title for the Quest platform and have since helped ship another mobile title and helped with operations for a few tiny indie studios as a &quot;#2&quot; guy to the studios&#39; owner. Trying to think of where to pour out my free time in order to improve my job prospects in this rough state of the industry so I can set myself up for long term success (which is, of course, never a sure thing).</p> <p>So, that begs the question? What makes for a superstar job candidate? Should I be making games in my free time and getting my hands dirty in unity? Should I be working on PM/Scrum/etc certifications? Work on gaining more business and operations knowledge/credentials?</p> <p>I realize this is sort of an existential question for myself, but curious if you guys have any thoughts on what sets someone apart as a desirable producer, beyond the soft skills, number of titles shipped, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alexm287"> /u/alexm287 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kttcly/what_sets_apart_a_a_top_tier_producer_from_their/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kttcly/what_sets_apart_a_a_top_tier_producer_from_their/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Not so long ago I realized that I kinda went <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/haele3d">full indie</a> two years ago and kinda survived, this is how it went, not always kindly.</p> <h1>BACKSTORY</h1> <p>I was working as a 3D generalist for a long time. One day a friend mentioned something about how cool Unreal Engine 4 with all the realtime stuff and no need for rendering. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t really touch it for months or years after, until I found myself on a hiatus like thingy and felt like learning something new, so I started to watch UE tutorials. Some game dev talks came up on youtube too.</p> <p>The very first talk I really remember was the talk of Jake Birkett where he explains how he survived years in game dev without a hit. I felt like game dev could be actually fun.</p> <p>Slowly I started to adopt UE4 into my workflow up until the point that it became my main work environment, but not yet as a game dev. Somewhere around covid with a lot of free time I started to dip my feet into blueprints and experimenting with small game ideas.</p> <p>There were a lot of prototypes, but most of them I canceled due to realizing after a while that their scope is well beyond me. (Some of them I still tinker with when I have some &quot;free&quot; time or need a bit of change). Nothing really serious came out of them.</p> <h1>BEST FEET FORWARD</h1> <p>One day browsing through the creative apps on play store and found some poser apps for hand and character character drawing, some of them had downloaded around 100K and even in the million range. I thought that maybe I could do it as well.</p> <p>There were multiple apps that dealt with hand, so I thought why not do a feet one for starter, so was the idea of HAELE 3D - Feet Poser Pro was born. In the beginning I thought about it as a mobile only app, that maybe later on if I make any money from it I could try to publish on Steam as well.</p> <p>Publishing on Play Store was a big pain with UE4, handling all the various SDKs and whatever requirements on play store, not to mention the 100mb limit made me nearly give up multiple times. So I started to do the port for PC as well.</p> <p>When I had something watcheble I started posting on Twitter, DeviantArt and Instagram, Twitter and Insta didn&#39;t really got picked up in the beginning, but somehow on Deviant Art the fetish community picked it up and suddenly it had a quite enthusiastic audience.</p> <p>They were asking about the PC version a lot, so my main focus changed to the pc build. I released it on Play Store too, but due to the constant changes in requirement and lack of interest, I decided to discontinue it and do it only for PC.</p> <p>I published HAELE 3D - Feet Poser Lite on Steam in April (2023), to make a bit of noise for the Pro version and give a cheaper alternative. It didn&#39;t really make much money at that time, but made enough to keep me hopes up for the Pro version.</p> <h1>15 MINUTES OF FAME</h1> <p>Then came around the next Next Fest where Feet Poses Pro participated with a demo. It was the first time when it kinda blew up, LVL 80 published an article about it, then it appeared in a podcast by Kotaku and various smaller articles.</p> <p>Then an article appeared on nothing less than <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/theres-a-foot-posing-simulator-with-a-free-demo-on-steam-if-thats-your-scene/">PC Gamer</a>, then later on GamerSky as well. Most of the articles just memed around it, but there were some serious words as well. I didn&#39;t really mind the memeing, like there is no bad advertisement right.</p> <p>I even doubled down a bit on the memey factor, started doing a bit of reddit somewhere all this, and suddenly had posts that made 1000k+ upvotes.</p> <p>Next fest made a ton of wishist (2-3k) with my scale than it was huge.</p> <p>Although I was already watching a lot of talks and articles from Chris Zukowski I didn&#39;t even hope to get on Popular Upcoming so I launched with a few K wishlist.</p> <p>I went quite fine for what I hoped for, it wasn&#39;t a big hit, but it made enough for me to stay alive and maybe decline a few jobs and start working on the Hand Poser, which people were asking around a lot about.</p> <h1>HANDS DOWN FAILURE</h1> <p>So I closed my eyes, turned down the jobs and put all my effort into Hand Poser Lite, I released with high hopes but not so high wishlists, whatever worked for the feet it didn&#39;t really for the hand.</p> <p>Did all the marketing you can do for free, nextfest and such and such.</p> <p>The EA launch of Hand Poser Lite was a disaster, barely made any money, I felt devastated, there were a lot of questions about it back then, but the wishlist somehow just didn&#39;t turn into sales. It felt like a huge failure.</p> <h1>FALLING ON MY FACE AGAIN</h1> <p>I thought okay maybe the pro version will do better so I started to prepare for the upcoming next fest, but in the meantime I also had an idea to give a try with a portrait drawing reference app that became HAELE 3D - Portrait Studio Lite.</p> <p>The experiments with it went quite well and quite quick, for some reason I had the idea that I will publish it&#39;s Lite version for free to see how much barrier of entry is my pricing (Feet and Hand Lite was around 14 USD Feer Pro around 30), so maybe that it&#39;s free could spread more easily and make some visibility for my other published apps.</p> <p>I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong, it made barely any visibility and of course no sales at all, it had 10k free downloads, but none of the charts moved at all. I asked Steam to turn it into a paid game. It was only nowdays that it managed to make enough to recoup the 100 USD entry.</p> <p>In the meantime, Hand Pro was in the garage, Hand Lite was making a little money, Feet Pro and Lite were making okay money to stay on the surface and keep developing.</p> <p>My next step was publishing Hand Lite into 1.0 after finishing it up, adding VR, a new menu, smoother controls and many improvements.</p> <p>Published it with a 2-3 K wishlist to 1.0 nothing really happened that night. Had like 14 sales or something, can we get lower than this I felt. Went to bed sad and sorry.</p> <h1>PURE LUCK ROCKET</h1> <p>Next morning I wake up it&#39;s kinda always the first thing for me to check visibility and sales charts. I saw a strange bump in Hand Poser Lite and an unusually high number, I think it was around 200, I was sure it was some kind of an error or I was watching a 3 month period or something, but no.</p> <p>Turned out that there was an article on GamerSky and a Twitter post that somehow <a href="https://x.com/gamespark/status/1797765505220215218">went viral </a>and peeked at around 3 million views. It pushed my sales biig time. I had bundles and cross promos set up with all my apps, so the huge visibility generated my GamerSky slowly spilled over to all of my apps and suddenly started to make sales all around. Localization is super important, it turned out, as it gives more visibility all around Steam for users who mostly play in their own language.</p> <p>I couldn&#39;t really believe my eyes, I didn&#39;t go super rich or anything overnight, but it gave me enough confidence to stay at the full indie solo dream, and keep working on the other apps.</p> <p>The interesting and kinda sad this that going viral with it I think is simply purely accidental algorithm magic, GamerSky has posted about my app before, but they never reached anywhere this traffic, it just happened I think cause their post somehow went online in a blessed time and got picked up like giant perfectly timed snowball and got tossed on and on.</p> <p>If it didn&#39;t happen I probably still sit around with below average sales and returning to my previous freelancing thing, but it did :)</p> <p>A bit later on I published the 1.0 for Feet Poser Pro as well, it was a nice bit of bump in sales, nothing like the Hand 1.0, but pushed everything a bit further.</p> <h1>SINKING LIKE A STONE</h1> <p>So I kept working on Hand Pro and starting a little side project to do something more interactive. Sales were a roller coaster based on Themed and Seasonal sales, but the baseline was higher than before, giving me buffer for another failure.</p> <p>The something more interactive was a little local multiplayer only game called Line of Fire - Pirate Waltz. If you are frequent in the sub you could have run into its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1irkudy/postmortem_my_game_converted_06_of_its_wishlists/">post mortem</a>, won&#39;t detail it here again. Key takeaway is that genre is super important just as well as an online option for any multiplayer. Yes I know, super obvious right, dunno what I was doing or hoping for, realized this all too late, so fail again.</p> <h1>RECENTLY...</h1> <p>After I swept away my sorrows of failure for like the third time, I returned to the finishing of Hand Poser Pro. With some semi successful reddit posts, a mediocre nextfest, with a bit of paid ads on twitter and reddit, around 300 usd tops or so, and more than a year of being in coming soon state on Steam, it managed to reach the popular upcoming charts with something 6,5K wishlist, the feeling when I saw the wishlist rating on Steam DB were overwhelming and very jumpy in every sense :)</p> <p>Now it&#39;s friday, it is already sitting on the first page of popular upcoming, a Publisher Sale Event is already set up to spread the visibility to other apps, it is going to release first thing on Monday morning. I don&#39;t know if it is going to be able to reproduce the success of Hand Lite, or just drop like the stone cause everybody is already fine with the Lite version, dunno.</p> <p>but I have some plans for the future, Portrait Studio Pro for example is ready for its own little failure already, but I hope it will fail upwards, and I can keep rolling on the kinda full indie dream :)</p> <p>I hope there is some takeaway for you from my story, my best wishes for you and your game if you read it so far, and for you too who didn&#39;t!</p> <p>Pace</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/igeolwen"> /u/igeolwen </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ktp6jd/i_went_full_indie_a_bit_more_than_2_years_ago_by/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ktp6jd/i_went_full_indie_a_bit_more_than_2_years_ago_by/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But we hoped that the gameplay would catch some players once we have a playable demo on Steam. And oh boy, it did!</p> <p>So we did release the demo one week ago and already had a peak of 18 concurrent players on the first day. More than we ever had in any playtest before! So we were quite happy with that.<br/> But just two days later we woke up and suddenly had over 50 concurrent players, placing us in the Top 100 most played demos in Steam! To be honest, we never really figured out where the players came from.</p> <p>The day later we woke up to a bigger German streamer playing the game for 5000 live viewers and our concurrent players went up to 227 and the demo was Top 20 WORLDWIDE! This gave our impressions on Steam a massive boost as we were shown in multiple categories like Top Demos, Trendling Wishlists etc. And of course also some smaller streamers and YouTubers started to create content about the game.</p> <p>We never reached the peak of 227 concurrent players again, but 50-80 concurrent players was quite normal for the last few days.</p> <p>Before releasing the demo we were normally getting 5-15 Wishlists a day, but in the last week we never got less than 100 a day, some days even 300 or 400.</p> <p>Just wanted to share our happiness and story. If you have any questions or want to hear more details/numbers, please ask! :)</p> <p>Also here&#39;s a link to the game, in case you want to check out the demo: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405540/Tiny_Auto_Knights/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=demo_first_week&amp;utm_medium=gamedev">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405540/Tiny_Auto_Knights/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaTeKaPe"> /u/KaTeKaPe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ktg59s/how_our_steam_demo_got_in_the_top_20_worldwide/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ktg59s/how_our_steam_demo_got_in_the_top_20_worldwide/">[comments]</a></span></div>

At the heart of this evolution lies the need for robust security ‚Äî enter the SDN firewall, a critical component for protecting telecom networks from threats while maintaining ultra-low latency and scalability.</p> <p>Traditionally built with languages like C or Python, SDN firewalls face trade-offs between speed, safety, and complexity. Rust, a modern systems language, offers a compelling alternative. In this guide, we‚Äôll dive into implementing a telecom-optimized SDN firewall in Rust. We‚Äôll cover SDN basics, Rust‚Äôs advantages, and a step-by-step implementation with code examples. Whether you‚Äôre a telecom engineer securing 5G networks or a Rust developer exploring SDN, this post will show you how Rust can redefine network security...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/syedmurtza"> /u/syedmurtza </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://medium.com/@Murtza/implementing-a-telecom-optimized-sdn-firewall-in-rust-39e2c7fa60fc">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ktn8ug/implementing_a_telecomoptimized_sdn_firewall_in/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This past month, I‚Äôve been seeing a flood of posts hating on Go - Medium articles, personal blogs, dramatic (/s) ‚Äúexpos√©s‚Äù (/s) of ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù (/s) bugs in random libraries, Reddit threads, YouTube videos, and more. Suddenly, Golang is apparently terrible. People listing all its flaws like it‚Äôs breaking news. ‚ÄúHave you seen how they handle errors??‚Äù Disgusting. Awful. Unusable. &quot;Literally trash language&quot;. lol</p> <p>But the timing of all these takes feels a little too convenient. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it ‚Äî but it‚Äôs hard not to notice how suddenly and frequently this stuff is popping up. I‚Äôm not against criticism - far from it - but Go hasn‚Äôt gone through any major changes recently. And if you filter out the subjective noise and stick to roughly objective complaints, you‚Äôll notice most of them have been part of the language for years. Yet somehow, they didn‚Äôt bother people that much before.</p> <p>And when it comes to foot-guns or accidentally installing some rogue package that wipes your disk - well, Go‚Äôs not exactly unique there either. That kind of stuff can happen in any language. The difference is, it‚Äôs easy to avoid in Go if you just use a bit of common sense. And honestly, that‚Äôs one of the things that still makes Go great: it doesn‚Äôt require much effort to write good code.</p> <p>Apologies if this has been talked about already - I tried looking but didn‚Äôt see anything recent.

The final source code is available on GitHub. Links provided below</p> <p>To me, it seems like it would be better to instantiate the DB and Logger in the main function, so that they can be used there, and passed to the handlers that need them, negating the need for DB and Logger to be part of the application struct. I think it would make more sense if the application struct and logic for assembling was in main() as well. I&#39;m not convinced the panic in main() is a good idea either. Would it not be better to use the logger to log something nicely then os.Exit(1)?</p> <p>It seems to me that the Application struct could just be a collection of handlers and middleware. That way you could have have SetupRoutes() be a method on the Application struct. It seems odd to pass the whole application struct to SetupRoutes() like he does here. I could understand if you where to pass all the handlers and middleware to it individually, but with his way you end up giving it more than it needs.</p> <p>I notice he doesn&#39;t implement any middleware to recover from panics in the handlers either.</p> <p>I also notice he is not very precise with language and terminology which doesn&#39;t give me confidence in his ability, but I&#39;m too new to this to be able to tell. I was hoping someone with a bit more experience has looked at this and might have some thoughts on it, or on what I&#39;ve said in this post.</p> <p><a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-go/">https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-go/</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Melkeydev/fem-project-live">https://github.com/Melkeydev/fem-project-live</a></p> <p>Edit:</p> <p>Here is my own code which I think is easier to understand?</p> <pre><code>func main() { logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil)) db, err := sql.Open(&quot;sqlite3&quot;, &quot;test.db&quot;) if err != nil { logger.Error(&quot;Failed opening database&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, err) os.Exit(1) } defer db.Close() userModel := model.NewUserModel(db) sessionModel := model.NewSessionModel(db) userHandler := handler.NewUserHandler(userModel, logger) sessionHandler := handler.NewSessionHandler(sessionModel, logger) middleware := middleware.NewMiddleware(logger) app := &amp;Application{ UserHandler: userHandler, SessionHandler: sessionHandler, Middleware: middleware, } srv := &amp;http.Server{ Addr: &quot;:8080&quot;, Handler: app.Routes(), ErrorLog: slog.NewLogLogger(logger.Handler(), slog.LevelError), } logger.Info(&quot;starting server&quot;, &quot;addr&quot;, srv.Addr) err = srv.ListenAndServe() logger.Error(&quot;Failed to start server&quot;, &quot;error&quot;, err) os.Exit(1) } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HugePin3873"> /u/HugePin3873 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ktp0w9/melkeys_frontend_masters_course/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ktp0w9/melkeys_frontend_masters_course/">[comments]</a></span></div>
