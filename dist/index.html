            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just pushed out the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dst-factory">dst-factory crate</a>. This crate makes it easy to create DSTs (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/dynamically-sized-types.html">Dynamically Sized Types</a>), which are great to reduce memory use and save some cycles when you have a lot of heap-allocated objects. For example, if you&#39;re building large graphs, using DSTs can save you at least 8 bytes per node, and often more.</p> <p>The <code>#[make_dst_factory]</code> attribute causes a <code>build</code> factory to be generated letting you easily create an instance of the annotated struct. The last field of the DST can be a <code>str</code>, an array (<code>[T]</code>), or a dyn trait.</p> <pre><code>#[make_dst_factory] struct MyStruct { id: u32, name: str, } // call the generated build factory which returns a Box&lt;MyStruct&gt;. let s = MyStruct::build(0, &quot;Name String&quot;); </code></pre> <p>Check it out, and please let me know of any bugs or new features you&#39;d like to see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/martin_taillefer"> /u/martin_taillefer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l3nh06/introducing_the_dstfactory_crate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l3nh06/introducing_the_dstfactory_crate/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Not because there&#39;s anything fancy about it, but because I genuinely could not find anything similar. I used to use `lossless-cutter` but because of it being an electron app it was not-working more often than working for me. `Ninve` (Ninve Is Not a Video Editor) uses MPV binary as a live preview for the edited video and then simply runs a lossles trim `ffmpeg` command to do the job. There&#39;s also mpv json ipc library in the repo which I wrote for this purpose, so if you wanna hack around with mpv you might find it useful as well.

Just recently studied Common Lisp for 3 months and write a little renderer with modern OpenGL ( lights , cameras materials and model loader ). It was a fun project but to be honest working with outdated packages and bindings became a chore ( especially on MacOS ) . My main fascination with lisp is the interactive way of working with lisp and its macro (DSL ) capability. I don‚Äôt think any other language comes close on that regard. </p> <p>Enter rust . I‚Äôm interested in learning more about gpu programming and wgpu caught my interest along with bevy and other projects. The rust community is much more active, but I‚Äôm wondering if rust is really for me ? I‚Äôm not working on projects with 60 other developers and I‚Äôm originally a C programmer so memory management is all part of the equation for me . ‚ÄúSafety‚Äù is important for me but it‚Äôs not top of the list . Rust however has a pretty impressive compiler in terms of error messaging . The LSP in vscode is also pretty cool . ( although doom eMacs with sly for Common Lisp is excellent in its own way ) .

For much longer I&#39;ve been building an MORPG game in Rust with <code>macroquad</code> and various other crates (like three different ECS&#39;). My main issue with <code>macroquad</code> is that it&#39;s not based on <code>wgpu</code> (which is amazing for compile times). Another gripe I have is that it tries to be 3D but it&#39;s really not that capable. Things like animations, <code>macroquad-tiled</code> and <code>macroquad-platformer</code> are very incomplete and don&#39;t work for a lot of cases and in my case needed to be rewritten anyway</p> <p>So I decided to build a 2D only graphics engine that is based on <code>wgpu</code>. It&#39;s something like <code>pixels</code> without the heavy optimizations but with textures, fonts and more. I&#39;m building <code>egor</code> with the intention of being generic over something game-specific. Currently I have two simple demos showcasing things like sprite animations (not an abstraction of egor) and I plan to add demos of things not related to games. It&#39;s meant to be a way to build GUI applications with basics like timing, input, rendering/fonts</p> <p>I&#39;m sharing it now because it&#39;s fairly capable for simplistic applications (see demos) and I&#39;d like to get some real feedback. Looking for that, contributions or whatever can help keep this thing moving</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wick3dr0se"> /u/wick3dr0se </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/wick3dr0se/egor">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l38pyw/egor_crossplatform_2d_graphics_engine/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I want to say sorry to the next person reading it, and I know if I came across it I would get sad, like how sad you get when seeing someone use a gazillion patterns in Java.</p> <p>so I&#39;m trying to resolve this skill issue.

I was hesitating between &quot;polish it a little bit more&quot; vs &quot;release it as early as possible to get some feedback&quot;. And here I am.</p> <p>Monstera is a framework that allows you to write stateful application logic in pure Go with all data in memory or on disk without worrying about scalability and availability. Monstera takes care of replication, sharding, snapshotting, and rebalancing.</p> <ul> <li>Built with performance in mind. All necessary data is local.</li> <li>Fewer moving parts and less network calls. No external dependecies.</li> <li>Complex things can be done with simple code. Simple execution model and strong transactional guarantees.</li> <li>Applications are easily testable and local development is a breeze.</li> </ul> <p>And all of that while being horizontally scalable and highly available.</p> <p>So far I have found that the most common question I get is &quot;Why?&quot;:) I definitely need to write more documentation and examples of problems it can help solving. But for now I have an example application completely built with it: <a href="https://github.com/evrblk/monstera-example">https://github.com/evrblk/monstera-example</a>. I hope it can help you understand what components are involved and how flexible you can be in implementing application cores.</p> <p>Make sure to read those docs first! They will help you understand the concepts and the example app better:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://everblack.dev/docs/monstera/overview/">https://everblack.dev/docs/monstera/overview/</a></li> <li><a href="https://everblack.dev/docs/monstera/units-of-work/">https://everblack.dev/docs/monstera/units-of-work/</a></li> <li><a href="https://everblack.dev/docs/grackle/concepts/">https://everblack.dev/docs/grackle/concepts/</a></li> <li><a href="https://everblack.dev/docs/grackle/locks/">https://everblack.dev/docs/grackle/locks/</a></li> </ul> <p>I would appreciate any feedback! Starting from what is not clear from readmes and docs, and finishing with what would you change in the framework itself.

Normally, in Yocto&#39;s bitbake tool, this isn&#39;t allowed, because it turns off network access for all phases except <code>do_fetch</code>, but the <a href="http://influxdb-1.8.10.bb"><code>influxdb-1.8.10.bb</code></a> Bitbake recipe uses the syntax</p> <pre><code>do_compile[network] = &quot;1&quot; </code></pre> <p>to keep networking turned on during the <code>do_compile</code> phase, so that the go build environment can do its thing.</p> <p>But, it&#39;s still failing.</p> <p>I&#39;m concerned that I may be falling victim to container-ception, as I&#39;m doing my bitbake build inside the crops/poky:debian-11 container already, and looking at the <a href="http://build.sh">build.sh</a> script that comes in when I clone the influxdb-1.8.10 repo manually, it looks like that wants to build a container from scratch, and then run the local build system from within that. This may be more of a question for the <a href="/r/docker">r/docker</a> sub, but I have to pass --net=dev-net to use my custom network pass-through to <strong>MY</strong> build container to insure that when anything in <strong>it</strong> tries to access the Internet, it does so through the correct network interface. My concern is that if the bitbake build environment for influxdb creates yet another docker container to do its thing in, that that inner container may not be getting run with my dev-net docker container networking setup properly.</p> <p>So, first question, what it the above go error message trying to convey to me? I can see in my build container, that I can resolve and pull down the URL: <a href="https://proxy.golang.org/cloud.google.com/go/bigtable/@v/v1.2.0.mod">https://proxy.golang.org/cloud.google.com/go/bigtable/@v/v1.2.0.mod</a>, without issue. So why isn&#39;t the influxdb go invocation incapable of it?</p> <p>Also, I am running systemd-resolved on local port 53, but not as IP address 127.0.0.11. That must be something in the inner container, which bolsters my theory that the inner container is scraping off the network configuration of the outer container.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmbeddedSoftEng"> /u/EmbeddedSoftEng </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l37o6q/not_a_go_dev_so_whats_going_wrong_here/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l37o6q/not_a_go_dev_so_whats_going_wrong_here/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around a couple of behaviors I can&#39;t understand well with Go generics. Here is a simple example, similar to a use case I&#39;m working on for a personal project now:</p> <p>``` import &quot;fmt&quot;</p> <p>type Animal interface { SetName(name string) }</p> <p>type Dog struct { name string }</p> <p>func (d *Dog) SetName(name string) { d.name = name }</p> <p>func withName[T Animal](name string) *T { a := new(T) a.SetName(name) return a }</p> <p>func main() { d := withName[Dog](&quot;peter&quot;)</p> <pre><code>fmt.Println(&quot;My dog: &quot;, d) </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>The compiler marks an error in <code>a.SetName(name)</code>:</p> <p><code> a.SetName undefined (type *T is pointer to type parameter, not type parameter) </code></p> <p>This is surely because of my unfamiliarity with the language, but I don&#39;t see how <code>a</code> being <code>*T</code> it&#39;s a problem, when the compiler knows <code>T</code> is an <code>Animal</code> and has a <code>SetName()</code> method.</p> <p>Which brings me to the other error I get which is somewhat related: In the line <code>d := withName[Dog](&quot;peter&quot;)</code> where the compiler complains: <code>Dog does not satisfy the Animal</code>.</p> <p>Now I know the this last one is due to the <code>Dog</code> method using a pointer receiver, but my understanding is that that&#39;s what one should use when is modifying the receiver. </p> <p>So with this context, I&#39;m very confused on what is the the go way in these situations. I know the following will silence the compiler:</p> <p><code> (*a).SetName(name) //de referencing d := withName[*Dog](&quot;peter&quot;) // Using *Dog explicitly in the type param </code></p> <p>But feels like I&#39;m missing something. How you satisfy interfaces / type constraints when pointer receivers are involved? I don&#39;t see people using the last example often.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2Spicy4Joe"> /u/2Spicy4Joe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l343vm/noob_question_generics_and_interfaces_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l343vm/noob_question_generics_and_interfaces_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve already googled some stuff but would be cool if someone</strong> <strong><em>sold</em></strong> <strong>it to me so to say</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dark_zarich"> /u/Dark_zarich </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l30nwj/my_company_is_pushing_go_for_web_backend_i_need/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l30nwj/my_company_is_pushing_go_for_web_backend_i_need/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Then I wanted to make a post for other Go devs looking for something similar to Dim. </p> <p>The verbosity of error wrapping structures were my main complaint about the language until I discovered another extension Lowlight Patterns which what I were using until I forked it for developing Dim. Then writing Go became pure enjoyment as in fact error wrapping style over try/catch in call hierarchies makes the code easier to parse for the first time for the mind. </p> <p>TLDR; Dim is basically a VS Code extension which dims parts of code that matches with regex based rules provided by you to pop the main logic. But I developed it mostly for dimming Go‚Äôs error blocks. So I added a lot of features to work as a proper block dimmer. </p> <p>For example Dim runs the common regex engine on full text; instead of some other extensions scanning doc twice for start and end markers to detect blocks. Dim lets you define rules with the regex singleline mode for blocks. Another is Dim skips dimming sections with unbalanced number of opening and closing braces; while your caret inside or any of the active selections are inside. Plus, there is ‚Äútoggle for editor‚Äù command that lets you see a source code without dim areas brings convenience when you combine it with a keyboard shortcut. </p> <p>The extension was very difficult to get it right as there were too many performance related issues. I once pulled it from Marketplace to work on it with sane mind. There were many gotchas with editor/document lifecycles and output pane was causing infinite loop. Hopefully Dim works like butter at version 3.1.8 for months. It now feels like a native editor featue. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ufukty"> /u/ufukty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ufukty.dim">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l2w5lm/how_i_fixed_error_wrapping_blocks_making_the_code/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
