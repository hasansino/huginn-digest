            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!<br/> So, I have been trying to write my own multiplayer game and I am confused on how to do it. I mean, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t know how to write networking, it&#39;s just... I am unsure what architecture type would benefit me the most. So, for context, here are my requirements :<br/> -&gt;Players can create lobbies which can be visible from a lobby list.<br/> -&gt;Other players can join these lobbies from the list or by entering the lobby&#39;s code.</p> <p>And for that, I have tried to implement an architecture that works as it follows :<br/> -&gt;Once the peer clients enter the online mode, they are connected to the server.<br/> -&gt;From there, they can open up lobbies that can be joined by other peers.<br/> -&gt;The entire server just manages the connections and the data transfer channels between the peers, not logic. The game logic will be processed by the host and sent to the others.<br/> -&gt;Despite writing my server in a data oriented manner with no classes, my packets only contain action flags and data that sort of simulate what events in OOP are (similar to <code>if recvPacket.message == &quot;AC:CRLB&quot; then lobby = newLobby(recvPacket.sender) end</code>)</p> <p>I didn&#39;t encounter much problems with this... in two days I managed to write a basic server router that allows players to host and join lobbies. But while sleeping... I suddenly realized that there might be some problems with this architecture. I mean, sure, it works perfectly for now. But the logic is all scattared across client and server. For example, for creating a lobby, the client sends a request to the server and the server sends back a response. There&#39;s two mechanisms to block a peer for opening two lobbies, one is local and one that is on the server. But then I realized... there will come more complex things to implement later, such as, making sure all the clients loaded their assets before game starts, or that all clients switched to the same game scene and so on... that seems like more work than I am willing to do at this point if that makes sense. Despite having no classes or pure events as a design pattern, my manual packets handling seems to not let me avoid problems like those I was running from when using high level frameworks and RPCs.</p> <p>So, there&#39;s another architecture in mind, I also think it&#39;s got a popular name called &quot;snapshot rendering&quot; where all the possible logic lives inside the server and the client is a thin renderer that receives from the server everything that it has to render and upon that data the server just runs the draw functions and sends back inputs like &quot;pressed W&quot; or &quot;clicked button&quot;. Now, this will increase server costs but will be much easier to write/read/modify and I will avoid an entire set of problems like syncing, cheating and so on. I believe that is exactly what games like CS 1.6 did back in the day because I always remember that when I played on a server that went down, all the game stopped suddenly, rendering only the last position of the camera and all players.</p> <p>So, my question is, personally, what would you prefer to use and why? For context, I am writing my game server in Lua with ENET and I kind of dislike OOP hence why I am not using high level frameworks or similar stuff.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yughiro_destroyer"> /u/yughiro_destroyer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r2igau/multiplayer_architecture_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r2igau/multiplayer_architecture_advice/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Adding to this, in many cases, the creator has a YouTube channel that reviews games that are worlds apart from the game they have asked a key for.</p> <p>This makes me suspect that pretty much all the approaches I receive are AI robots trying to scrape keys for selling-on later.

My current architecture is made of action pipelines (draw, play, attack) and a class that consumes global events that can come from anywhere within the pipelines.</p> <p>For example:<br/> - During card play, an on-play card triggers a draw event, with the appropriate parameters. This event is consumed and the card is drawn for the the player (or the npc).</p> <p>- During attack, an on-death card triggers a death event, ....</p> <p>It works fine in the current state of development, I can easily extend functionality and write boilerplate code for the event handling, so once a mechanic is written, it can handle all of it&#39;s combinations, but my main concern is testability.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to write unit tests to be 100% sure that all the combinations are working as I&#39;d expect them and so far it seems like that it&#39;s either very hard or straight impossible to test the current architecture.</p> <p>I was wondering if I&#39;d have a queue where I just push events and at the end of the turn they are just automatically resolved (or based on other logic), then it would&#39;ve been a lot easier, because I&#39;d know from the board state that which event will follow which and I can write tests based on the event queue and check the states according to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/arzenal96"> /u/arzenal96 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r25pw4/would_an_action_queue_be_mandatory_for_a_ccg/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r25pw4/would_an_action_queue_be_mandatory_for_a_ccg/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I shipped a real-time screen translation overlay on Steam. It took about a month to get through the review process, 5 rejections, and one mass of duct tape I&#39;m not proud of. Here&#39;s what I learned in case anyone else is crazy enough to ship a non-game utility through Steam.</p> <hr/> <h3>The origin: a hand-drawn requirements doc</h3> <p>My wife plays a lot of PC games that aren&#39;t localized in Japanese. Her workflow was: screenshot &gt; open Google image translate on her second monitor &gt; drag screenshot in &gt; read &gt; go back to the game. For every dialogue box.</p> <p>One day she handed me [this hand-drawn spec](IMGUR_LINK_HERE) and said &quot;build me a translation magnifying glass.&quot; The title at the top reads &quot;Honyaku Loupe&quot; (Translation Loupe). She even drew a circular magnifying glass design before concluding at the bottom: &quot;practically speaking, it should probably just be a rectangle...&quot;</p> <p>That drawing became the entire product requirements document. I&#39;m not joking.</p> <hr/> <h3>Lesson 1: Steam DLC is not consumable</h3> <p>My app uses AI translation (Gemini API), which costs money per call. I needed users to buy translation credits. My first idea: sell a &quot;Translation Credit Pack&quot; as DLC.</p> <p><strong>Rejected.</strong> Turns out Steam DLC can only be purchased once per account. You can&#39;t buy the same DLC again. This seems obvious in hindsight - DLC is &quot;Downloadable Content,&quot; not a token system.</p> <p>I had to pivot to Steam&#39;s In-Game Purchases (microtransaction) system instead. That meant integrating with a completely different API and going through a separate approval process.</p> <hr/> <h3>Lesson 2: Logo visibility is no joke</h3> <p>Steam requires a lot of image assets - capsule images, header images, library assets, etc. Your app&#39;s logo/name must be clearly readable in every single one.</p> <p>I got rejected 3 times on logo alone. Text slightly too small? Rejected. Contrast not strong enough against the background? Rejected. The review team is incredibly strict about this and they should be - your assets are your storefront. But I wasn&#39;t expecting the level of pixel-perfection required.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Design your capsule images at the smallest display size first and make sure the text is legible there. Then scale up. I did it backwards and paid for it.</p> <hr/> <h3>Lesson 3: Read every checkbox</h3> <p>One of my rejections was because I forgot to update a checkbox indicating that the app contains In-Game Purchases. That&#39;s it. One checkbox. A full review cycle wasted.</p> <p>Steam&#39;s app configuration has a LOT of fields and checkboxes. After switching from DLC to In-Game Purchases, I updated the code, the store description, the pricing - but missed one metadata checkbox. Go through every field twice before submitting.</p> <hr/> <h3>Lesson 4: WPF + Steam Overlay = pain</h3> <p>The app is built with C# / WPF / .NET 7.0. WPF was the right choice for a transparent, always-on-top overlay window - it handles that better than anything else on Windows, even in 2026.</p> <p>But Steam Overlay doesn&#39;t play nice with WPF. The overlay injects itself into DirectX/OpenGL render loops, and WPF doesn&#39;t use either for its normal rendering pipeline. This means when a user clicks &quot;Buy Credits,&quot; the Steam purchase overlay simply... doesn&#39;t appear.</p> <p>My solution: the in-app purchase screen is rendered using OpenGL. Just that one screen. The rest of the app is pure WPF. It&#39;s ugly architecturally, but it works.</p> <p>If you&#39;re building a non-game app for Steam with WPF/WinForms/etc., plan for this. Steam Overlay integration is essentially undocumented for non-game frameworks.</p> <hr/> <h3>Lesson 5: Your spouse is the harshest QA tester</h3> <p>My wife found a memory leak by playing for 3 hours straight - something no test plan would have caught because I never tested continuous usage that long.</p> <p>She also rejected my first UI because &quot;the font is ugly,&quot; refused to use the app until I added a hotkey she liked, and filed a bug report (verbally, at dinner) about OCR failing on a specific game&#39;s stylized font.</p> <p>If you have a non-technical user who actually needs your product in their daily life, put them in front of it as early as possible. They will find things you never thought to test, and they will not be polite about it.</p> <hr/> <h3>Tech stack summary (if curious)</h3> <ul> <li>C# / WPF / .NET 7.0 (overlay and main UI)</li> <li>OpenGL (Steam Overlay purchase screen only)</li> <li>Windows.Media.Ocr for local OCR (free, no network)</li> <li>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite API for translation</li> <li>2-layer cache (local + server) - players on the same game share cached translations, 50-70% cache hit rate</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3>TL;DR</h3> <ul> <li>Steam DLC is one-time purchase only - use In-Game Purchases for consumables</li> <li>Design capsule images at smallest display size first - logo legibility is heavily scrutinized</li> <li>Check every metadata checkbox after making changes</li> <li>Steam Overlay doesn&#39;t work with WPF - I had to use OpenGL for just the purchase screen</li> <li>Hand-drawn specs from your wife are surprisingly effective requirements documents</li> </ul> <p>Happy to answer questions about the Steam review process for non-game apps, WPF overlay development, or managing stakeholders who share your bed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Big-Perspective-5768"> /u/Big-Perspective-5768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r1y62d/5_steam_rejections_a_handdrawn_spec_from_my_wife/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r1y62d/5_steam_rejections_a_handdrawn_spec_from_my_wife/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been writing Rust apps that need Supabase, and Supabase just doesn&#39;t have an official Rust SDK. Sure, you can use raw HTTP requests and piece it together yourself, but a proper SDK is such a nicer solution. The JavaScript, Python, Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter communities all have first-party clients — Rust had nothing official.</p> <p>So I built one that has feature parity with the official SDKs for other languages.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://crates.io/crates/supabase-client-sdk">supabase-client-sdk</a></strong> is a full-featured Rust client for Supabase with a fluent, JS SDK-like API. It uses the PostgREST REST API by default (no database connection needed), with an opt-in <code>direct-sql</code> feature for direct PostgreSQL access via sqlx.</p> <h2>What&#39;s in it</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Query Builder</strong> — Fluent API for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, UPSERT, and RPC. 20+ filter methods, count options, CSV/GeoJSON output, <code>explain()</code>, the whole thing.</li> <li><strong>Derive Macros</strong> — <code>#[derive(Table)]</code> for type-safe queries with automatic table/column mapping.</li> <li><strong>Auth (GoTrue)</strong> — Email/password, phone, OAuth, magic link, OTP, anonymous auth, Web3 wallet auth, SSO, MFA (TOTP + phone), session management with auto-refresh, admin API, and full OAuth 2.1 server + client-side PKCE flow.</li> <li><strong>Realtime</strong> — Phoenix Channels v1 protocol over WebSocket. Postgres Changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE listeners), Broadcast, and Presence tracking with auto-reconnect.</li> <li><strong>Storage</strong> — Bucket management, file upload/download/move/copy, signed URLs, public URLs, image transforms (resize, quality, format).</li> <li><strong>Edge Functions</strong> — Invoke deployed Deno functions with JSON/binary/text bodies, custom headers, region routing.</li> </ul> <p>Everything is feature-gated so you only pull in what you need:</p> <p>```toml supabase-client-sdk = &quot;0.1.0&quot;</p> <h1>or pick and choose:</h1> <p>supabase-client-sdk = { version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;, features = [&quot;auth&quot;, &quot;realtime&quot;] } ```</p> <h2>Architecture</h2> <p>It&#39;s structured as a modular Cargo workspace with 8 independent crates — core, query, derive, auth, realtime, storage, functions, and the main facade. Each crate is published separately on crates.io, so if you only need, say, the auth client, you can depend on <code>supabase-client-auth</code> directly without pulling in the rest. The main <code>supabase-client-sdk</code> crate ties them all together behind feature flags, and each sub-crate adds an extension trait on <code>SupabaseClient</code> so the API feels cohesive:</p> <p>```rust let client = SupabaseClient::new(config)?;</p> <p>// Query let rows = client.from(&quot;cities&quot;).select(&quot;*&quot;).eq(&quot;country&quot;, &quot;Japan&quot;).execute().await;</p> <p>// Auth let session = client.auth()?.sign_in_with_password_email(&quot;<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;).await?;</p> <p>// Realtime let realtime = client.realtime()?; realtime.connect().await?;</p> <p>// Storage let storage = client.storage()?; storage.from(&quot;photos&quot;).upload(&quot;pic.png&quot;, data, FileOptions::new()).await?;</p> <p>// Edge Functions let functions = client.functions()?; functions.invoke(&quot;hello&quot;, InvokeOptions::new().body(json!({&quot;name&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}))).await?; ```</p> <h2>Why I built this</h2> <p>I wanted to use Supabase in Rust without having to hand-roll HTTP requests for every feature. The JS SDK is genuinely nice to use, and I wanted that same experience in Rust. It took a while — especially getting realtime and the full OAuth flows right — but I&#39;m happy with where it landed.</p> <p>360+ integration tests and runnable examples for every feature — query basics, typed queries, advanced queries, auth, realtime, storage, and edge functions. Just <code>supabase start</code> locally and <code>cargo run --example auth --features auth</code> to see any of them in action.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Crates.io:</strong> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/supabase-client-sdk">supabase-client-sdk</a></li> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Brainwires/rust-supabase-client">Brainwires/rust-supabase-client</a></li> <li><strong>Docs:</strong> <a href="https://docs.rs/supabase-client-sdk">docs.rs/supabase-client-sdk</a></li> </ul> <p>This is v0.1.0 — just published today.

This, together with built-in wgpu integration allows you to create zerocopy video processing pipelines. These basically allow you to:</p> <ol> <li><p>decode the video</p></li> <li><p>process it with wgpu</p></li> <li><p>encode the result</p></li> </ol> <p>with the raw, uncompressed video staying in GPU memory the whole time, with the only GPU &lt;-&gt; RAM copies being of compressed video. This is meaningful, because uncompressed video is huge (about 10GB/min of 1080p@60fps).</p> <p>The encoder can also be used on its own to record any sequence of frames rendered using wgpu.</p> <p>The encoder API is a bit awkward for now, but we&#39;re actively working on making it safe as soon as possible, it just requires some upstream contributions which take time.</p> <p>Plans for the nearest future include streamlining the process of creating zerocopy one-to-many-resolutions transcoders, and then adding support for more codecs (we still only support H.264 for now).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx"> /u/xXx_J_E_R_Z_Y_xXx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/smelter/tree/master/vk-video">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r20523/vkvideo_020_now_a_hardware_decoding_and_encoding/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wrote a macro to concatenate constant strings. As you may know, it&#39;s not possible with <code>std::concat!()</code>. That can only concat <em>literals</em> and macros which produce literals (e.g. <code>env!()</code>).</p> <p>There is also a library (and probably others) called constcat. But I feel like this is too small of a thing to add another dependency for. <a href="https://docs.rs/constcat/latest/constcat/">https://docs.rs/constcat/latest/constcat/</a></p> <p>So, here&#39;s my approach:</p> <p>```rs macro_rules! const_str { ($name:ident = $value:expr) =&gt; { #[allow(unused)] macro_rules! $name { () =&gt; { $value }; } #[allow(unused)] const $name: &amp;str = $value; }; }</p> <p>const_str!(FOO = &quot;foo&quot;); const_str!(BAR = &quot;bar&quot;); const_str!(FOOBAR = concat!(FOO!(), BAR!()));</p> <p>fn main() { println!(&quot;{}&quot;, FOOBAR); } ```</p> <p>The idea is that you declare every constant string with the <code>const_str!</code> macro and pass it the name and value. (Or, at least every constant which needs to be concatted further.) It produces an actual constant <em>as well as a macro with the same name</em>. So, if you need to concat that to a bigger string, you can use the macro instead of the constant.</p> <p>An alternative is to declare every constant string only as a macro (verbose, five lines for each string) and always use it as a macro invocation (very ugly IMO). And if you use a mix of the two, you might have to change the declaration &amp; all use sites of a const string when you later want to const-concat it.</p> <p>If a coworker wanted to introduce this in your codebase, would you be opposed to it? What would be your arguments?</p> <p>Edit: Added equal sign in the macro syntax to make it nicer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdmiralQuokka"> /u/AdmiralQuokka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r1y93z/is_this_const_str_concat_macro_cursed_or_blessed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r1y93z/is_this_const_str_concat_macro_cursed_or_blessed/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I maintain Bifrost, an open-source LLM gateway. When we started, Python seemed obvious - most AI tooling is Python, FastAPI is familiar, huge ecosystem.</p> <p>We went with Go instead. Here&#39;s why:</p> <p><strong>Concurrency model at scale</strong></p> <p>LLM gateways spend most time waiting on external API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc). Need efficient concurrency for thousands of waiting requests.</p> <p>Go: 10,000 goroutines, ~2KB each, cheap context switching. Python: GIL limits parallelism. Even with asyncio, thread contention becomes the bottleneck past 500-1000 RPS.</p> <p><strong>Latency overhead</strong></p> <p>Bifrost: ~11 microseconds per request at 5,000 RPS LiteLLM: ~8ms per request</p> <p>That&#39;s roughly 700x difference. At 10,000 requests, that&#39;s 110ms vs 80 seconds overhead.</p> <p><strong>Memory efficiency</strong></p> <p>Go&#39;s memory footprint: ~68% lower than Python alternatives at same throughput.</p> <p>We run production on t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB). Python gateways we tested needed t3.xlarge for same load.</p> <p><strong>Deployment simplicity</strong></p> <p>Single static binary. No dependencies. No virtual environments. Copy to server, run it.</p> <p><strong>Where Python wins</strong></p> <p>Python&#39;s ML ecosystem is unmatched. For model serving or training, Python is the obvious choice.</p> <p>But for infrastructure - proxies, routers, gateways - Go&#39;s strengths (HTTP handling, connection pooling, efficient concurrency) align perfectly.</p> <p><strong>The tradeoff</strong></p> <p>Smaller ecosystem for AI-specific tooling. But gateways don&#39;t need ML libraries. They need efficient I/O and concurrency.</p> <p>Code: <a href="http://github.com/maximhq/bifrost">github.com/maximhq/bifrost</a> </p> <p>For Gophers building infrastructure: have you hit similar Python performance walls?

Sharing the architecture since this space is getting more complex the moment you move beyond single agent setups.</p> <p>problem was fairly simple on paper. Multiple agents need to share knowledge without constantly overwriting each other. A shared database alone does not give you memory semantics or conflict handling.</p> <p>Current layout looks roughly like this</p> <pre><code>type MemoryService struct { store *MemoryStore pubsub *PubSub consolidator *Consolidator } </code></pre> <p>agents write observations into isolated namespaces. A consolidation layer merges related memories and resolves overlaps. Pubsub propagates relevant updates so agents can react without polling everything. Consistency is eventual which is good enough for this workflow.</p> <p>Stack is mostly boring and stable. nats for pubsub, postgres for durable storage, redis as hot cache, grpc between agents.</p> <p>conflict resolution turned out to be the most interesting part. When two agents learn contradictory information you need clear rules. Current approach is pragmatic: timestamp based resolution for hard facts, voting style resolution for softer signals, manual review for critical conflicts.</p> <p>so far it handles around 100 agents without noticeable degradation. Memory writes are roughly 50ms and retrieval with consolidation lands around 100ms on average.</p> <p>Saw on twitter there&#39;s a Memory Genesis Competition happening around long term agent memory. Makes sense that distributed coordination is becoming a bigger issue as people scale beyond toy examples.</p> <p>Go ended up being a solid fit here. goroutines make the concurrent consolidation pipeline straightforward and predictable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/breadislifeee"> /u/breadislifeee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r260g4/distributed_memory_system_for_multi_agent/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r260g4/distributed_memory_system_for_multi_agent/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I am happy with the result and I am &quot;rushing&quot; to the end, hoping to release next month or in early April. If it looks interesting and you want to wishlist it, that would be great.</p> <p>Anyway, let&#39;s talk about the juicy stuff: the tech! </p> <p>As you can imagine, it&#39;s made using <strong>Rust</strong>. It&#39;s using a custom framework; the first idea was to use Notan, but I wanted to experiment a bit with wgpu, so I made a new repo and started experimenting. That evolved into a sort of &quot;new Notan&quot; that I am using right now (there is a chance I&#39;ll put all this new stuff into Notan eventually, if I don&#39;t starve to death first hahaha).</p> <p>So, along with wgpu, it uses <strong>Kira</strong> for audio, <strong>winit</strong> for windowing on native platforms, and a custom solution for web. I used <strong>shipyard</strong> for the ECS initially, but eventually I moved to <strong>bevy_ecs</strong> because the ergonomics, commands, and message systems (IMHO) made it simpler to work with. Those were things I missed and wanted to implement in my game, but it was just easier to move to a solution that already had them. I feel that the code got much simpler at that point, but this can be subjective.</p> <p>The physics system is a boid simulation that uses parallel iterators and parallel systems where it makes sense. This, along with the batching system for drawing, allows me to put a lot of stuff on the screen in the end-game, which is nice. There is room for some optimizations yet, but I am spending too much time on this project and have decided to just do these things when the &quot;market needs it.&quot;</p> <p>Let&#39;s talk about the <strong>pain points</strong> with this game: the ECS, the UI, and the cost of fast prototyping.</p> <p><strong>The ECS:</strong> I have been programming in Rust for 5 or more years already, so I am very used to it and I like it. However, creating games while trying to do it &quot;similarly to other languages&quot; is hard due to its restrictions. I feel forced to use ECS (not always), and while ECS fits this project very well, I kind of feel that I don&#39;t like it... sometimes I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. There is some complexity and verbosity to it, and it needs a specific mental model to fit ideas into it. This is mainly true in the first steps of a new project, because once you set an architecture, adding, removing, or changing pieces is the easy part.</p> <p><strong>UI:</strong> This is hard. No matter if it&#39;s in an ECS environment or not, having something simple, performant, and flexible for games (animations, reactions, etc.) is hard in Rust, at least if you do it from scratch. I ended up with a monstrosity that uses <strong>Taffy</strong> and an ECS pattern similar to <code>bevy_ui</code>, and while it works well, I am not happy with it and I would love to have some time eventually to improve this.</p> <p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> This one probably isn&#39;t a Rust issue, but a &quot;do it yourself&quot; issue, where I need to do everything from scratch, reinvent the wheel, and do basic stuff just to have the foundation to build the thing I wanted to test. Refactoring things here have a huge impact too. This is the most dangerous part of building games like this for me right now, because the cost can leave you with less room to iterate or pivot ideas, making your game potentially worse because you will run out of time or money.</p> <p>Anyway, I don&#39;t want to end the post with the feeling that I didn&#39;t like making my game with Rust. I love the language, it&#39;s one of my favorites and probably my main go-to for &quot;everything&quot;, but it probably wasn&#39;t the right call for a commercial project that I was expecting to take less than a year. But this is on me... I am usually very bad at estimating project timelines.</p> <p>Thanks for joining me in my TED talk hahaha</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Nazariglez"> /u/Nazariglez </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3979140/Karma_Keepers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1r1w0mu/custom_engine_wgpubevy_ecskira_my_incrementalidle/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
