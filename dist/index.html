            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m making a medical application that allows users to upload images taken with a microscope (very large usually 2GB or more) and then view them later with annotations created by machine learning models to classify parts of cells etc.</p> <p>The problem is that after a user has uploaded a file, I use a decoder to convert the image from one of the many microscopy formats to a standardised format. Now since this application will run in security critical applications such as hospitals, I dont want a compromised user/hacker uploading a malicious file and for the decoder to try to open it. I would ideally be able to check if this file contains malware before executing it. Now I will probably have this decoding process go on in a container in an isolated server in case the file is crafted to exploit some 0-day vulnerability in the decoders, but is it possible to perform checks on the file before its opened by any programs at all to check if its general malware.</p> <p>Are there any Rust libraries that offer such functionality? Should I just submit the file hash to some 3rd party virus database and check for the result? Is this even a concern or something that can be mitigated by such a check or should I just attempt to decode the file in a container and if it fails it fails and not bother prechecking it?</p> <p>It just seems wrong to not do a check, but I also dont think such a check would be the most fruitful and the containerised, isolated run it and check if it decodes approach is the way but I&#39;m not sure. Would love some thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/noureldin_ali"> /u/noureldin_ali </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kujvmr/check_file_uploads_for_malware_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kujvmr/check_file_uploads_for_malware_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I think this is giving me a hard time wrapping my mind around how to properly structure things with the way rust &quot;wants&quot; you to do it. Heres the problem</p> <p>In my game, I have a GameObject trait</p> <pre><code>trait GameObject { /// Gets the unique ID of this game object used to identify it. fn get_id(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str; /// Gets the action wheel of this object (every object must have one) fn get_action_wheel(&amp;self) -&gt; impl ActionWheel; } </code></pre> <p>So far so good, the problem is that when I try to make a generic collection of these objects, such as a <code>Vec&lt;dyn GameObject&gt;</code> it doesnt work because the GameObject isnt dyn compatible. I just dont really understand what Im meant to do in scenarios like this. If I wrapped it in an enum, every time I access a wheel from something that implements the GameObject, even if I know the concrete wheel it will return (based on the object), I would still need to check the enum which just seems kind of strange.</p> <p>Any advice on this? How do you think about this?

The server is optimized for reliability, security, and ease of deployment in production environments.</p> <hr/> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Authoritative DNS</strong>: Serves authoritative responses for all queries to your domain (e.g., <code>anydomain.tld</code>).</li> <li><strong>Multi-Record Support</strong>: Handles A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, PTR, TXT, and CNAME records.</li> <li><strong>DNSSEC Ready</strong>: Supports DNSSEC key management and secure record signing.</li> <li><strong>High Performance</strong>: Asynchronous networking (UDP/TCP) via Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent queries.</li> <li><strong>RFC Compliance</strong>: Strict adherence to DNS protocol standards for interoperability.</li> <li><strong>Extensible Storage</strong>: Uses SQLite for DNS record storage, allowing easy updates and migrations.</li> <li><strong>Easy Deployment</strong>: Includes deployment and update scripts for smooth operational workflows.</li> <li><strong>Comprehensive Logging</strong>: Integrates with <code>env_logger</code> for detailed runtime diagnostics.</li> <li><strong>Web Interface</strong>: (Coming soon) Administrative web UI for DNS record management.</li> <li><strong>API Service</strong>: (Coming soon) RESTful API service for programmatic DNS record management.</li> <li><strong>User Management</strong>: (Coming soon) Multi-user access control with role-based permissions.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>Architecture</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Language</strong>: Rust (2021 edition)</li> <li><strong>Async Runtime</strong>: <a href="https://tokio.rs/">Tokio</a></li> <li><strong>Database</strong>: SQLite via <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite">rusqlite</a></li> <li><strong>Logging</strong>: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/log">log</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/env_logger">env_logger</a></li> <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a></li> <li><strong>DNSSEC</strong>: Built-in support for key loading and RRSIG/DS/DNSKEY records</li> <li><strong>Web Framework</strong>: (Coming soon) <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a> or <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum">Axum</a> for UI and API endpoints</li> <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: (Coming soon) JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization</li> <li><strong>Containerization</strong>: Docker support with Alpine Linux for minimal footprint</li> <li><strong>Cross-Compilation</strong>: Support for building from Debian to Alpine Linux (musl) target</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>DNS Record Management</h2> <p>DNS records are managed in an SQLite database (<code>dns.db</code>). The schema supports multiple records per domain and type, and can be easily updated using SQL scripts.</p> <p><strong>Example schema (<code>dns_records.sql</code>):</strong> <code>sql CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dns_records ( domain TEXT NOT NULL, record_type TEXT NOT NULL, value TEXT NOT NULL, ttl INTEGER DEFAULT 3600, PRIMARY KEY (domain, record_type, value) ) WITHOUT ROWID; </code></p> <p><strong>Sample records:</strong> <code>sql INSERT OR REPLACE INTO dns_records VALUES (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;203.0.113.10&#39;, 3600), (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;MX&#39;, &#39;10 mail.anydomain.tld&#39;, 3600), (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;NS&#39;, &#39;ns1.anydomain.tld&#39;, 3600), (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;NS&#39;, &#39;ns2.anydomain.tld&#39;, 3600), (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;SOA&#39;, &#39;ns1.anydomain.tld hostmaster.anydomain.tld 1 10800 3600 604800 86400&#39;, 3600), (&#39;anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;TXT&#39;, &#39;&quot;v=spf1 a mx ~all&quot;&#39;, 3600), (&#39;www.anydomain.tld&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;203.0.113.10&#39;, 3600); </code></p> <h2>DNSSEC Support</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Key Management</strong>: DNSSEC keys are loaded from environment-configured paths.</li> <li><strong>Record Signing</strong>: Supports RRSIG, DS, and DNSKEY records for secure, signed DNS responses.</li> <li><strong>Preprocessing</strong>: Key files can be preprocessed using provided scripts before deployment.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h2>How to Create <code>DNSSEC_KEY_FILE</code></h2> <p>To enable DNSSEC for <code>nx9-dns-server</code>, you need to generate a DNSSEC key pair and provide the public key file to the server via the <code>DNSSEC_KEY_FILE</code> environment variable. Here&#39;s how you can do it using <a href="https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#dnssec-keygen">BIND&#39;s dnssec-keygen tool</a>:</p> <h3>1. Install <code>dnssec-keygen</code></h3> <p>On most Linux systems, you can install it via the package manager:</p> <p>```bash sudo apt-get install bind9-dnsutils # Debian/Ubuntu</p> <h1>or</h1> <p>sudo yum install bind-utils # CentOS/RHEL ```</p> <h3>2. Generate DNSSEC Key Pair</h3> <p>Run the following command to generate a 2048-bit RSA key for your domain (replace <code>anydomain.tld</code> with your actual domain):</p> <p><code>bash dnssec-keygen -a RSASHA256 -b 2048 -n ZONE anydomain.tld </code></p> <ul> <li>This will produce two files in your current directory: <ul> <li><code>K.+008+.key</code> (public key)</li> <li><code>K.+008+.private</code> (private key)</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h3>3. Set the <code>DNSSEC_KEY_FILE</code> Environment Variable</h3> <p>Copy the public key file (<code>.key</code>) to your server&#39;s key directory (e.g., <code>/var/nx9-dns-server/</code>):</p> <p><code>bash cp Kanydomain.tld.+008+24550.key /var/nx9-dns-server/ </code></p> <p>Then, set the environment variable in your deployment environment or systemd service:</p> <p><code>bash export DNSSEC_KEY_FILE=&quot;/var/nx9-dns-server/Kanydomain.tld.+008+24550.key&quot; </code></p> <p>Or in your systemd unit file: <code> Environment=&quot;DNSSEC_KEY_FILE=/var/nx9-dns-server/Kanydomain.tld.+008+24550.key&quot; </code></p> <h3>4. (Optional) Preprocess the Key</h3> <p>If your deployment uses a preprocessing script (as referenced in your <code>deploy.sh</code>), run:</p> <p><code>bash sudo chmod +x /var/nx9-dns-server/preprocess-key.sh sudo -u dnsuser /var/nx9-dns-server/preprocess-key.sh </code> This may normalize the key format or permissions as required by your server.</p> <h3>5. Restart the DNS Server</h3> <p>After setting the key file, restart your DNS server to load the new key:</p> <p><code>bash sudo systemctl restart dns-server.service </code></p> <h3>6. Verify DNSSEC is Working</h3> <p>Use the provided <code>dnscheck.sh</code> script or <code>dig</code> to verify DNSSEC records:</p> <p>```bash bash dnscheck.sh</p> <h1>or manually:</h1> <p>dig @localhost anydomain.tld DNSKEY +dnssec ```</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong><br/> - Keep your <code>.private</code> key file secure and never expose it publicly. - Only the <code>.key</code> (public) file should be referenced by the server. - The server will load and use the public key for signing DNS responses.</p> <hr/> <h2>Deployment</h2> <h3>Traditional Deployment</h3> <p>Deployment is automated and robust, using the provided [<code>deploy.sh</code>](deploy.sh) script. This script handles permissions, key preprocessing, SOA updates, binary replacement, and service management.</p> <p><strong>Typical deployment steps:</strong> ```bash</p> <h1>!/bin/bash</h1> <p>set -e</p> <p>SRC_BIN=&quot;/home/youruser/apps/your-ddns/dns_server&quot;

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all. I used to love <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist">cargo-dist</a> for quickly generating cargo-binstall-compatible binaries in GitHub-Actions-generated releases. The latest release was in January and the latest commit three months ago. That doesn&#39;t seem too bad, right? Well, the current release of cargo-dist generates workflows using &quot;ubuntu-20.04&quot; as runner, which was removed in April. So, it&#39;s completely and utterly broken. You can&#39;t even easily fix it by hand, because dist checks if the workflow file is &quot;out of date&quot;, i.e. it will complain and fail if the file has been tampered with. I thought maybe there is a config option to tell dist which runner to use... but <a href="https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/"><em>the website is down</em></a>. (The documentation is obviously in the repo too, but I couldn&#39;t figure out how to fix it based on that either. (Edit: a friendly commenter replied with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kufjn6/comment/mu15luo/">fix</a>)) I think it&#39;s safe to say, the people backing cargo-dist have jumped ship. It&#39;s unfortunate. I and probably many others will now have to figure out a new &quot;blessed&quot; release workflow for our little Rust tools.</p> <p>PSA over, I hope you have a good day!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdmiralQuokka"> /u/AdmiralQuokka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kufjn6/psa_cargodist_is_dead/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kufjn6/psa_cargodist_is_dead/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It&#39;s a program that generates Voronoi patterns in the most naive way: looping through pixels, checking which point is closest and from that determining the color of that pixel. </p> <p>I <em>had</em> coded this before in both Lua and Python, and I like using it as an exercise when learning new languages since it touches on a lot of interesting points of any language (using data structures, loops, writing to files, using libraries, etc) and all of the logic is already implemented, so I can focus on just making it work. </p> <p>Rust is my first contact with systems programming, and I don&#39;t have a background in computer science or tech, so it was <em>very</em> challenging. The language really has a very particular way of getting you to do things that are super unfamiliar in the scripting languages I&#39;m used to. This took me like a day and a half (two hours of which I spent trying to solve why the Rand crate was failing to find the dlltool executable, but ok), whereas I could code the Python version in a couple of hours. But man, Cargo and the compiler made things <em>so much</em> easier. I&#39;ve read a lot online about how the rust compiler kind of teaches you how to code in it, and it&#39;s absolutely true. Error messages were super helpful, even sometimes suggesting corrections in the code.</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;m still riding the high of getting it to work and compiling perfectly, and wanted to share this small personal milestone. Feel free to critique the code and suggest improvements. Curiously, I&#39;ve benchmarked the code and the Lua version was way faster, so I might&#39;ve done something in a not-so-optimal way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SureImNoExpertBut"> /u/SureImNoExpertBut </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kud2zs/made_my_first_ever_thing_in_rust_im_super_proud/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kud2zs/made_my_first_ever_thing_in_rust_im_super_proud/">[comments]</a></span></div>

So no macro compilation time overhead or complex types that are hard for the rust-analyzer to handle. It uses <a href="https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres">rust-postgres</a> driver under the hood, so it supports query pipelining and the perfomance should be pretty good as well.</p> <p>It is NOT my project, but it seems to me like it deserves more attention. This is the only Postgres crate that solves my use case of querying deeply nested one to many relationships where rows contain nullable columns (with a little hacky patch) and extensively using domain types.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EdgyYukino"> /u/EdgyYukino </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kubllk/cornucopias_rust_from_sql_generator_maintained/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kubllk/cornucopias_rust_from_sql_generator_maintained/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Worked at a number known Studios in both US and Canada. Learned a lot, seen a lot. I also experienced through the 2008-2012ish stretch of large scale industry layoffs which was also a very tough time for the industry, However I would say that based off my own personal assessment of the industry today and also my current personal circumstances, I think its definitely my time to start preparing for a career change. </p> <p>I have never been so grateful to still be employed and have never been unemployed this whole time, However, I have never been so miserable, so highly anxious, and also just so disgusted about how bad everything has shaped up to be seeing all my favorite people thrown into terrible life circumstances losing thier jobs, but not only this I just have a major distaste for alot of things lately on the business side whether its investors, publishers, corporations, even in some extent the consumers of the games we work hard to create being toxic trolls. I do not see the recovery in any near term however I do see some optimism arising in the indie games sector. I definitely think AAA legacy is heading towards its blockbuster moment. With all this said, its my time for something new.</p> <p>I can only imagine I am not the only 3D Artist here looking for other adjacent industries to explore or pivot towards. If so, perhaps some of you already made the change, If so what did you choose and why?</p> <p>I&#39;m actually considering moving towards Arch Viz, Virtual Production any mainly anything that is Unreal focused and is making impacts towards. I have also considered getting more into UX Design because I at least always see places hiring for this in my area, Could be interesting to stand out in that realm with a 3D art background. I also thought about getting into industrial design or digital fashion. If anyone made any switches id like to hear your experiences, How do you like the change? Do you feel less or more fulfilled? Do you feel like you&#39;re treated with more respect or less? id love to hear it all.</p> <p>Thank you and I don&#39;t post on Reddit much so forgive me If I&#39;m not following proper rules and ethics here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tylerwoodz416"> /u/tylerwoodz416 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kukv1t/question_for_all_3d_artists_have_you_considered/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kukv1t/question_for_all_3d_artists_have_you_considered/">[comments]</a></span></div>

To easily expose your APIs as tools for AI agents, without the huge manual effort or limitations of simple proxying. It handles schemas, prompts, and more.</p> <p>It reads your OpenAPI spec and generates the full Go server boilerplate, complete with structured input schemas (JSON Schema) and detailed response templates (markdown prompts) for LLMs. It handles complex OpenAPI features and saves a ton of manual coding.</p> <p>check it out: <a href="https://github.com/lyeslabs/mcpgen">https://github.com/lyeslabs/mcpgen</a></p> <p>Feedback and stars are welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Intention_2396"> /u/Odd_Intention_2396 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kulxhg/opensourcing_mcpgen_a_go_tool_to_turn_openapi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kulxhg/opensourcing_mcpgen_a_go_tool_to_turn_openapi/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Is there a shorter/cleaner way to group strings for lookups? I want to have a struct (or something similar) hold all my DB CRUD types in one place. However I find it a little clunky to declare and initialize each field separately.</p> <pre><code>var CRUDtype = struct { CreateOne string ReadOne string ReadAll string UpdateOneRecordOneField string UpdateOneRecordAllFields string DeleteOne string }{ CreateOne: &quot;createOne&quot;, ReadOne: &quot;readOne&quot;, ReadAll: &quot;readAll&quot;, UpdateOneRecordOneField: &quot;updateOneRecordOneField&quot;, UpdateOneRecordAllFields: &quot;updateOneRecordAllFields&quot;, DeleteOne: &quot;deleteOne&quot;, } </code></pre> <p>The main reason I&#39;m doing this, is so I can confirm everywhere I use these strings in my API, they&#39;ll match. I had a few headaches already where I had typed &quot;craete&quot; instead of &quot;create&quot;, and doing this had prevented the issue from reoccurring, but feels extra clunky. At this point I have ~8 of these string grouping variables, and it seems like I&#39;m doing this inefficiently.</p> <p>Any suggestions / feedback is appreciated, thanks!</p> <p>Edit - Extra details:</p> <p>One feature I really like of doing it this way, is when I type in &quot;CRUDtype.&quot; it gives me a list of all my available options. And if pick one that doesn&#39;t exist, or spell it wrong, I get an immediate clear compiler error. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UghImNotCreative"> /u/UghImNotCreative </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kukgsn/how_to_group_strings_into_a_struct_variable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kukgsn/how_to_group_strings_into_a_struct_variable/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>! I recently built a dotfiles manager called <strong>lnk</strong> and would love to get some feedback from the community.</p> <p><strong>Why I Built This</strong></p> <p>After years of wrestling with chezmoi&#39;s complexity and yadm&#39;s Git quirks, I wanted something that felt more like... just Git. You know that feeling when a tool has so many features you spend more time reading docs than actually using it? That&#39;s what pushed me to build lnk.</p> <p><strong>What It Does</strong></p> <p><strong>lnk</strong> moves your dotfiles to <code>~/.config/lnk</code> (which becomes a Git repo), creates symlinks back to their original locations, and wraps Git commands nicely. That&#39;s literally it.</p> <pre><code>lnk init lnk add ~/.vimrc ~/.bashrc ~/.config/nvim lnk push &quot;setup complete&quot; </code></pre> <p>On a new machine: <code>lnk init -r your-repo &amp;&amp; lnk pull</code> and you&#39;re done.</p> <p>The core philosophy is: if you know <code>git push</code>, you know <code>lnk push</code>. Same mental model, better automation for the tedious symlink stuff. It&#39;s a single Go binary (~8MB) with atomic operations and rollback on failure.</p> <p><strong>Current State</strong></p> <p>It&#39;s <strong>pre-1.0</strong> so the API might shift, but I&#39;ve been using it daily for months without issues. The atomic operations mean if something goes wrong, it rolls back cleanly (which was a hard requirement after some... incidents with earlier versions).</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/yarlson/lnk">https://github.com/yarlson/lnk</a></p> <p><strong>Questions for the Community</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Does this approach make sense?</strong> I&#39;m trying to hit the sweet spot between Dotbot&#39;s simplicity and chezmoi&#39;s power</li> <li><strong>Any feedback on the code structure?</strong> Especially around error handling and the atomic operations</li> <li><strong>Would you actually use this?</strong> Or does it solve a problem that doesn&#39;t exist?</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;d be very grateful if someone could take a look at the code or try it out. Constructive criticism is more than welcome!</p> <p>Thanks for your time, and sorry if this is the 47th dotfiles manager you&#39;ve seen this month. üòÖ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yarlson2"> /u/yarlson2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ku9ul9/i_built_lnk_gitnative_dotfiles_manager_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ku9ul9/i_built_lnk_gitnative_dotfiles_manager_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>
