            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the comments on the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pnz1iz/bincode_development_has_ceased_permanently/">bincode announcement</a> from earlier today, I saw many allegations that when the maintainer changed their name in the project&#39;s git history, they could have also snuck in some sort of malicious code. Amidst all the fear-mongering, I didn&#39;t see anyone actually attempting to check whether or not this was the case.</p> <p>The process was trivial. I cloned the latest version from <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Estygianentity/bincode">Sourcehut</a>, then went to the old GitHub repo and scrolled through the forks for one which contained the last-known &quot;good&quot; commit, <code>Update criterion requirement from 0.5 to 0.6 (#781)</code>. Then I added it as a remote with <code>git remote add github &lt;fork URL&gt;</code>, did a <code>git fetch github</code>, and finally <code>git diff trunk github/trunk</code>. The output was as follows:</p> <pre><code>[name changes redacted] --- a/README.md +++ b/readme.md @@ -1,16 +1,4 @@ -Due to a doxxing incident bincode development has officially ceased and will not resume. Version 1.3.3 is considered a complete version of bincode that is not in need of any updates. Updates will only be pushed to the in the unlikely event of CVEs.

I have my own old name splashed across various publications, projects, and git histories. Now I have to worry about any backlash I might catch if I try and change any of that.</p> <p>It bothers me that here on <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a>, most of the comments I read were piling onto the maintainer and slinging serious accusations rather than trying to actually verify whether any of these fears were founded. The maintainer&#39;s response may have been less than ideal, but by their account, they were asleep when the internet suddenly blew up over a change they&#39;d made four months ago and moved on from. Can you imagine waking up to a social media deluge like that, and over something that&#39;s already emotionally charged like your identity? Are we not capable of extending a little grace to our fellow community members? Even in the most recent thread, I saw commenters digging up and posting the maintainer&#39;s old name, something that they&#39;d clearly expressed significant discomfort over. (Thanks to the mods here for cleaning that up.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/azqy"> /u/azqy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1poe6ts/bincodes_source_code_still_matches_what_was_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1poe6ts/bincodes_source_code_still_matches_what_was_on/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After about 10 years of doing web development (full-stack but primarily back-end) my wish is to transition into lower-level role (platform engineer, compilers / tools engineer, back-end engineer etc). I already have some experience with C++ and Rust from doing pet projects like 2D game engine and key-value database. Things haven&#39;t moved much in that direction because it was just a hobby, web dev was bringing money to the table and there are not many opportunities where I am for system programming roles. I realized I should move to freelancing and in the future I&#39;ll be looking at remote / relocation opportunities.</p> <p>I&#39;ve decided to take a “professional sabbatical” for about a year where I would focus on learning some fundamental stuff (algos &amp; data structures, networking, databases, operating systems...), do projects in Rust, get accustomed with the ecosystem and try contributing to open source projects to build my CV.</p> <p>I understand there are no guarantees for anything but I wanted to check with people who work / recruit whether this makes sense and would lack of professional experience with Rust still be harming given the current state of highly competitive market for Rust jobs. Has anyone tried something similar and was a gap in your CV accepted well by the companies interviewing you or they were not happy about it?</p> <p>P.S. I know I shouldn&#39;t focus on only one language as a SWE and I agree with that. I&#39;d be okay if I eventually end up doing C++ on my future job. However, I&#39;d seriously like for it to be Rust, because since I&#39;ve tried it many years ago I was fascinated how well designed it is and how great tools and the whole ecosystem around it are.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fantomacan_"> /u/fantomacan_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1podzxb/is_this_a_realistic_plan_for_transitioning_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1podzxb/is_this_a_realistic_plan_for_transitioning_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is fast and has some cool features that go beyond launching applications. </p> <p>At first I was a bit annoyed by the amount of boilerplate you write compared to frameworks like leptos or dioxus, but it actually felt quite intuitive after a while. The whole experience was actually quite nice and I kinda came to like the way state management works. Really cool how far GUI in rust has come over the last years (also looking forward to try Iced after their recent update, and dioxus&#39; Blitz renderer once it is a bit more complete). I think we may actually be GUI soon...</p> <p>The biggest annoyances I had while building this were:</p> <ul> <li>GPUI isn&#39;t using the typical crates used in the rust UI ecosystem (winit, wgpu), leading to poor platform support regarding some more niche stuff (e.g. wlr layer shell windows are not supported in the version released on <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a>, querying monitors/displays not implemented on wayland, ...)</li> <li>No documentations/guides (although reading through the source and just messing with it is honestly not the worst way to learn)</li> </ul> <p>Also a big shout out to the <a href="https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-component">gpui-component</a> crate, which is what really makes GPUI a feasible choice. </p> <p>You can find my project on <a href="https://github.com/zortax/zlaunch">GitHub</a> if you wanna check it out (disclaimer: used LLM assistance and didn&#39;t have prior GPUI experience, just went for it, so probably not the best reference for GPUI usage).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zortax_"> /u/Zortax_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/qprvxfqarm7g1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1podgkf/media_built_an_application_launcher_to_learn_gpui/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Binaries are ~3x smaller too (~700KB vs ~2MB).</p> <p>The core insight: make the cold pass smarter to make the hot pass do less work. Instead of simple pixel equality, the cold pass scans dynamic-sized blocks and marks &quot;problematic&quot; ones - blocks that might contain differences. The hot pass then only runs YIQ perceptual diff and antialiasing check on those problematic blocks, skipping everything else entirely. PNG I/O uses spng (C library) via Rust bindings.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Over time, I’ve seen many Rust and Tauri developers looking for meaningful projects to contribute to—projects that help them grow their skills while also solving real problems and serving real users.</p> <p>I’d like to propose a path that many developers may not be familiar with, but one that I know has a community ready to benefit from it: <strong>building a dedicated editor for AsciiDoc</strong>.</p> <p>This would <em>not</em> be a WYSIWYG editor. That approach goes against the philosophy behind AsciiDoc itself. Instead, the idea is to build an editor—and a parser—written in Rust, one that respects the principles behind the AsciiDoc syntax and treats it as a structured, semantic format. Such a tool would have clear adoption potential among people in the <a href="/r/technicalwriting">r/technicalwriting</a> community who write in AsciiDoc—myself included.</p> <p>I’m confident there is real demand for this, and that there are professionals willing to test and use such a tool. Why does this matter?</p> <p>Technical writers and other writing professionals often don’t want to rely on general-purpose code editors with dozens of extensions. They want a <strong>dedicated, lightweight tool</strong> that allows them to focus on writing, while still providing intelligent assistance, integrated diff management, and version control through Git—all within the same application.</p> <p>What I’m proposing is an intersection between the <strong><a href="/r/technicalwriting">r/technicalwriting</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="/r/tauri">r/tauri</a></strong> communities: working together on something different, but aimed at a very real and underserved audience.</p> <p>One challenge is that many people don’t fully understand the philosophy behind AsciiDoc. Because of that, I decided to take two concrete steps:</p> <ol> <li><strong>First</strong>, to propose an open ideation around what an editor designed <em>for writers who use AsciiDoc</em> should look like—conceptually and technically.</li> <li><strong>Second</strong>, to share a repository I created that aims to make the philosophy behind AsciiDoc more understandable, and to explain why that philosophy matters when designing a good writing tool for AsciiDoc users.</li> </ol> <p>Here are some relevant references and context:</p> <p><strong>Real-world usage of AsciiDoc by technical writers:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/search/?q=asciidoc&amp;cId=56264a28-9979-4954-a660-458d41bdc13c&amp;iId=ff8009ea-0721-4183-adff-b45c293dfa7a">https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/search/?q=asciidoc&amp;cId=56264a28-9979-4954-a660-458d41bdc13c&amp;iId=ff8009ea-0721-4183-adff-b45c293dfa7a</a></p> <p><strong>The AsciiDoc Manifesto</strong>, which explains the philosophy behind AsciiDoc and why WYSIWYG editors are not the right approach—while also arguing that a tool <em>designed specifically for AsciiDoc</em> can be both powerful and widely adopted: <a href="https://github.com/mcoderz/the_asciidoc_manifesto">https://github.com/mcoderz/the_asciidoc_manifesto</a></p> <p><strong>Finally</strong>, a gist with my own ideation on what a “perfect” AsciiDoc editor could look like: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcoderz/7adcd2a940318ebc17420c27d742e3fa">https://gist.github.com/mcoderz/7adcd2a940318ebc17420c27d742e3fa</a></p> <p>If you’re a Rust or Tauri developer looking for a project with real users, or a technical writer interested in better tools for structured writing, I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Opposite_West8608"> /u/Opposite_West8608 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1po1gtm/building_a_rust_tauri_editor_for_asciidoc_an/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1po1gtm/building_a_rust_tauri_editor_for_asciidoc_an/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is the first release of the library that we consider suitable for external users.</p> <p>Code: <a href="https://codeberg.org/rlst/rlst">https://codeberg.org/rlst/rlst</a> Documentation: <a href="https://docs.rs/rlst/latest/rlst">https://docs.rs/rlst/latest/rlst</a></p> <p>It is a feature-rich linear algebra library that includes:</p> <ul> <li>A multi-dimensional array type, allowing for slicing, subviews, axis permutations, and various componentwise operations<br/></li> <li>Arrays can be allocated on either the stack or the heap. Stack-allocation well suited for small arrays in performance critical loops where heap-based memory allocation should be avoided.<br/></li> <li>BLAS interface for matrix products, and interface to a number of Lapack operations for dense matrix decompositions, including, LU, QR, SVD, symmetric, and nonsymmetric eigenvalue decompositions<br/></li> <li>Componentwise operations on array are using a compile-time expression arithmetic that avoids memory allocation of temporaries and efficiently auto-vectorizes complex componentwise operations on arrays.<br/></li> <li>A sparse matrix module allowing for the creation of CSR matrices on single nodes or via MPI on distributed nodes<br/></li> <li>Distributed arrays on distributed sparse matrices support a number of componentwise operations<br/></li> <li>An initial infrastructure for linear algebra on abstract function spaces, including iterative solvers. However, for now only CG is implemented. More is in the work.<br/></li> <li>Complex-2-Complex FFT via interface to the FFTW library.</li> <li>A toolbox of distributed communication routines built on top of <code>rsmpi</code> to make MPI computations simpler, including a parallel bucket sort implementation.</li> </ul> <p>What are the differences to existing libraries in Rust?</p> <p><strong>nalgebra</strong></p> <p>nalgebra is a more mature library, being widely used in the Rust community. A key difference is the dense array type, which in <strong>nalgebra</strong> is a two-dimensional matrix while rlst builds everything on top of n-dimensional array types. Our expression arithmetic is also a feature that nalgebra currently does not have. A focus for us is also MPI support, which is missing in nalgebra. </p> <p><strong>ndarray</strong></p> <p>ndarray provides an amazing n-dimensional array type with very feature rich iterators and slicing operations. We are not quite there yet in terms of features with our n-dimensional type. A difference to our n-dimensional type is that we try to do as much as possible at compile time, e.g. the dimension is a compile time parameter, compile-time expression arithmetic, etc. ndarray on the other hand is to the best of our knowledge based on runtime data structures on the heap</p> <p><strong>faer</strong></p> <p>faer is perfect for a fully Rust native linear algebra environment. We chose to use Blas/Lapack for matrix decompositions instead of faer since our main application area is HPC environments in which we can always rely on vendor optimised Blas/Lapack libraries being available.</p> <p><strong>Vision of rlst</strong></p> <p>In terms of vision we are most looking at PETSc and its amazing capabilities to provide a complete linear algebra environment for PDE discretisations. This is where we are aiming long-term.</p> <p><strong>Please note that this is the first release that we advertise to the public. While we have used rlst for a while now internally, there are bound to be a number of bugs that we haven&#39;t caught in our own use.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HeavyMath2673"> /u/HeavyMath2673 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pnx98q/rlst_rust_linear_solver_toolbox_04/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pnx98q/rlst_rust_linear_solver_toolbox_04/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this is a redundant question, but no matter how much I&#39;ve googled through the web or on Reddit, I can&#39;t find a good, straightforward answer for Go specifically</p> <p>Basically, I&#39;m still new to Go, and right before I left my old company, a former senior engineer at an incredibly popular open-source company gave me a sort of confusing/unclear code review about my use of variables. For context, this was for a pretty simple build script – basically zero concerns about scalability, and it never directly affected end-users. The feedback seemed to be based on pursuing best practices, rather than any actual concerns about memory usage. This was also a small project pretty separate from the rest of the core team, so I wasn&#39;t sure if it was worth getting a second opinion from someone not involved with the project</p> <p>I don&#39;t have the exact code to post, so I&#39;m using a pretty simple algo to describe what I was told (I know about the much more optimized solution, but needed some something that shows off the feedback).</p> <p>Heres&#39;s essentially what I had (you don&#39;t need to focus too much on the logic, just on where the variables are placed):</p> <pre><code>func areEqualByRotation(a string, b string) bool { aLen := len(a) if aLen != len(b) { return false } if aLen == 0 { return true } aStack := []rune(a) for rotationsLeft := aLen - 1; rotationsLeft &gt; 0; rotationsLeft-- { el := aStack[0] for i := 1; i &lt; aLen; i++ { aStack[i-1] = aStack[i] } aStack[aLen-1] = el allMatch := true for i, bChar := range b { if bChar != aStack[i] { allMatch = false break } } if allMatch { return true } } return false } </code></pre> <p>And I was told to move all variables that were defined in the loops to the topmost level of the function body (which you can see right after the second return statement):</p> <pre><code>func areEqualByRotation(a string, b string) bool { aLen := len(a) if aLen != len(b) { return false } if aLen == 0 { return true } aStack := []rune(a) var el rune var bChar rune var i int var allMatch bool for rotationsLeft := aLen - 1; rotationsLeft &gt; 0; rotationsLeft-- { el = aStack[0] for i = 1; i &lt; aLen; i++ { aStack[i-1] = aStack[i] } aStack[aLen-1] = el allMatch = true for i, bChar = range b { if bChar != aStack[i] { allMatch = false break } } if allMatch { return true } } return false } </code></pre> <p>I wish I had the chance to ask him about the feedback, but I left the day after the review came in, so I just made the changes to get the code merged in</p> <p>In my mind, it&#39;s better to keep all variables scoped as aggressively as possible. Bare minimum, that helps with readability, and minimizes how much you need to keep in your head before you reach the meat of the function. I can see situations when it would be <em>required</em> to define them out of the loop, especially for pointers and closures, but the change felt like overkill, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it would have much benefit</p> <p>I know Go has escape analysis, and part of me would hope that it would detect that none of these variables are persisted for long, and would do optimizations to reuse memory, rather than declaring new things every single iteration</p> <p>Am I wrong in assuming this? I mostly come from the TypeScript world where memory usage doesn&#39;t get nearly the same amount of scrutiny, so I&#39;m not used to thinking about memory like this</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Parky-Park"> /u/Parky-Park </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1po51dh/when_should_i_be_worried_about_where_to_define/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1po51dh/when_should_i_be_worried_about_where_to_define/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Every one needs deployment, monitoring, logging, error handling, I&#39;m recreating what an api gateway does.
