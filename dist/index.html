I found this site: <a href="https://liberatedpixelcup.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator">https://liberatedpixelcup.github.io/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator</a> Even though it has very good variety with its customization, I think it is mostly for medieval themed games and I need a player model that has guns for a game that takes place in an alien planet. The closest example I can think of is something like the Doom Guy, or some kind of astronaut suit with guns. I am open to buying spritesheets as well but I could not find a source that has good variety. Please let me know if you know a good source or ideally something like the above mentioned generator but allowing us to create a player model for our theme.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Duruk4nBTN"> /u/Duruk4nBTN </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohzjse/good_spritesheet_generator_or_a_place_to_buy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohzjse/good_spritesheet_generator_or_a_place_to_buy/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Let&#39;s leave out the marketing aspect out of context for this discussion and assume that the game will get some traction and attention (imagine good IP). </p> <p>Topic is highly controversial, players like to say they hate these games, but we can&#39;t deny that they exist and some of them are fairly successful.</p> <p>I skipped the research but Diablo Immortal comes to mind, with a guy who spent a million dollars and basically locked him out of the game, because matchmaking algorithm couldn&#39;t find another wacko for him. And there&#39;s ton of games like Marvel SNAP who make the most profit from small percentage of players called &quot;whales&quot; who spend tens of thousands of dollars on a single account.</p> <p>Many games obfuscate transactions behind obscure currencies - probably due to legal and psychological reasons. It&#39;s also common that there are layers upon layers of mechanics to further obfuscate the fact that the player actually converts real money into wins in game.</p> <p>But for the sake of this discussion let&#39;s assume that the game is blatantly honest about it&#39;s intent.<br/> For example, let&#39;s assume a Diablo like game where you can perform quests to level up your character or simply spend a $1 for 1 point in character development.</p> <p>What kind of game mechanics or interactions would make people want to play such game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mrz33d"> /u/mrz33d </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohzcxl/how_about_a_purely_pay_to_win_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohzcxl/how_about_a_purely_pay_to_win_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

However, the comment that received even more upvotes than the post itself was this:</p> <p><em>&quot;12 years on a mobile game? What are you making?&quot;</em></p> <p>There were quite a few others, like the one I created my title from: <em>&quot;What in God&#39;s name have you been making for 12 f\</em>cking years?&quot;<em>, or another one: *&quot;If you&#39;ve developed a mobile game for 12 years, it&#39;s probably going to be bad&quot;</em>.</p> <p>So, I decided to actually answer the question and share the story of my game - especially since such long-term projects are pretty unusual these days, and most solo/indie developers seem to focus on shorter development cycles.</p> <p>And you can decide how bad the game turned out to be.</p> <p>I&#39;ll try to answer all the main questions:</p> <ul> <li>What game am I making?</li> <li>Why has it taken so long?</li> <li>Why do I keep working on it?</li> <li>How much money has it earned so far? and even</li> <li>How do I promote my game?</li> </ul> <h1>TL;DR</h1> <p>I started making an idle/incremental game <strong>back in 2013</strong> and released it as a Flash game on Kongregate <strong>in 2016</strong>. It turned out to be quite successful, got a lot of traction and <strong>earned a decent profit</strong> from in-app purchases over the next four years, while I focused completely on fixing bugs, adding features, and creating more and more content.</p> <p><strong>In 2020</strong>, when Flash technology died, I decided to port the game to Unity and publish it on mobile. <strong>In May of this year (2025)</strong>, I finally released it on Google Play. Currently I&#39;m still working on it (and probably will keep doing so).</p> <h1>Wrong assumption</h1> <p>One wrong assumption that commenters are probably making is that when I say I&#39;ve been working on the game for 12 years, it means the game is still not released.</p> <p>That&#39;s not true! The first version of the game was released back in 2016, 3 years after I started developing it. I mean, it&#39;s still a pretty long development cycle, just not 12-years long, right?</p> <h1>What game am I making?</h1> <p>At the end of 2013, I stumbled upon <strong>Cookie Clicker</strong> - an idle/incremental game that had just been released at the time - and I completely fell in love with the concept.</p> <p>However, as a game developer, I instantly found hundreds of aspects that could be added or improved to make the game even better. I guess many people here know exactly what I&#39;m talking about.</p> <p>So, I got to work right away. And that&#39;s how my own idle/incremental game was born. I called it <strong>Get a Little Gold</strong>, because instead of baking cookies, players collect gold by clicking on a stone in the middle of the screen.</p> <p>At that time, idle games were almost non-existent. Name any popular title in this genre, and I&#39;m 100% sure it was released after I started working on mine. <em>Clicker Heroes, NGU Idle, Antimatter Dimensions, Trimps</em>, even <em>Adventure Capitalist</em> - all of these came out after 2013.</p> <p>So <strong>Get a Little Gold</strong> was one of the pioneers of its genre, and many concepts that are now widely used were first introduced in my game. For example, challenges and multiple layers of prestige.</p> <h1>Why did it take so long?</h1> <p>Despite looking simple on the surface, the game is actually quite deep and packed with content that gradually reveals itself as players progress, prestige, and unlock new layers, modes and upgrades. In its current state, it will likely take you 3-4 months just to reach the late midgame and unlock all the main modes.</p> <p>Moreover, in 2014 (a year after I started working on the game) my daughter was born. That made me absolutely happy, but it also affected my productivity not in the best way.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, it took me <strong>3 full years</strong> to create and balance the first version of the game before finally publishing it on Kongregate.</p> <p>Players on Kongregate seemed to really enjoy the game, and that motivated me to keep improving it and adding more content like new challenges, modes, and unlocks. So I kept working on it for the <strong>next 4 years</strong>, releasing about <strong>40 major updates</strong> (almost one per month!).</p> <p>Until, in 2020, Flash Player was discontinued (stopped working in browsers), and I ended up with a popular and loved game that couldn&#39;t be played anymore.</p> <p>That&#39;s why I decided to port my game to Unity and bring it to mobile devices. Honestly, I always thought idle games were a perfect fit for mobile, but I&#39;d never had the chance to make one. The end of Flash felt like a sign that it was finally time.</p> <p>However, to do that, I first had to learn Unity and C#, since I&#39;d only ever worked with Flash and its ActionScript 3 programming language before.</p> <p>It took me <strong>about a year to learn Unity and another one to rewrite nearly half of the game</strong>, when russia invaded my country and launched missiles on my hometown. The war terminated development for a full year. During that time, I created another short project about the russian invasion - but that&#39;s another story.</p> <p>I returned to working on <strong>Get a Little Gold</strong> in mid-2023 and kept developing it until, finally, in <strong>May 2025</strong>, I finished the port and released it on Google Play.</p> <h1>Why do I keep working on it?</h1> <p><strong>Get a Little Gold</strong> is my most successful project so far. Before that, I had made a few smaller games, but none of them ever reached the numbers that Get a Little Gold did. Not only did it gather <strong>over 2 million plays on Kongregate</strong> and become one of the most played idle games on the portal, but it also started generating a pretty decent income through in-app purchases. I&#39;ll get back to the actual numbers a bit later.</p> <p>That&#39;s why I decided to invest even more time into porting the game and releasing it on mobile devices.</p> <p>The game also managed to build an <strong>incredibly friendly and dedicated community on Discord</strong>. These people have been waiting and supporting me throughout the entire process of porting the game. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I would have been able to finish the game without their support.</p> <p>Right now, I&#39;m working on the iOS version of Get a Little Gold, which will hopefully be released in 2026.</p> <p>And as long as people keep playing, I plan to keep updating the game and adding new content.</p> <h1>What about money?</h1> <p>During the 4 years when the game was active on Kongregate, it earned <strong>almost $105,000</strong> (around 90% from in-app purchases and the remaining 10% from ads).</p> <p>I know that&#39;s not much (especially since it was further reduced by Kongregate&#39;s commission and taxes), but my monthly &quot;salary&quot; still ended up being considerably higher than the average salary in Ukraine at that time. At the same time, I&#39;m fully aware that in many Western countries it would be impossible to live on that income.</p> <p>After releasing the game on Google Play, it now earns <strong>a little over $1,000 per month</strong> on average, and I&#39;m doing my best to keep improving it and hopefully increase that number. I also hope that releasing the game on iOS will help boost the revenue.</p> <h1>What have I done to promote the game?</h1> <p>First of all, my main source of promotion has been players who loved the original Kongregate version. They helped me test the mobile version and became its first players.</p> <p>Additionally, a little over 2 years ago I created <strong>a YouTube channel</strong> where I share my development journey and post devlogs. For example, here&#39;s a video where I tell the full story of the game in detail: <a href="https://youtu.be/xUVbQG4_pe0">How I solo created the game that earned more than $100K</a></p> <p>Finally, since I don&#39;t have any budget to spend on ads, the only other promotion I&#39;ve done is a couple of Reddit posts. Genre-specific subreddits like <a href="/r/incremental_games">r/incremental_games</a> can be a great way to showcase your game and attract some players.</p> <p>Also, as a solo game developer with 15 years of experience, I&#39;m fully aware that developers rarely play other developers&#39; games. So, speaking about reddit posts, believe it or not, the one you are reading right now wasn&#39;t made to promote my game, but rather to share my somewhat unusual experience, which I hope might be useful to some of you.</p> <p>With that said, if anyone decides to give my game a try, I&#39;d really appreciate your thoughts: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TheGamestStudio.GetaLittleGold">Get a Little Gold on Google Play</a></p> <p>This was a long post, and I tried to cover everything, but if you still have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments. And thank you for reading all the way to the end!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jarofed"> /u/jarofed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohihpl/what_in_the_gods_name_have_i_been_making_for_12/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohihpl/what_in_the_gods_name_have_i_been_making_for_12/">[comments]</a></span></div>

(Spoiler: No miracle happened, but I'm pretty satisfied.)</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not all bad. I&#39;ll break it down.</p> <h1>Let&#39;s start with the final numbers. During Next Fest, I got</h1> <ul> <li><strong>339 Wishlists</strong></li> <li><strong>~110 Demo Players</strong></li> <li>Several YouTube videos</li> <li>A few Twitch streams</li> </ul> <p>Considering I started the fest with only <strong>~250 total wishlists</strong> and 100 players, I&#39;m thrilled. Wishlists are now back to the normal 3-5 per day, and new demo players are still trickling in. Everything&#39;s back to baseline.</p> <h1>The Conversion Funnel</h1> <ul> <li>Impressions: 45,754</li> <li>Store Page Visits: 1,639</li> <li>Impression-to-Visit Conversion: 3.5%</li> <li>Wishlists: 339</li> <li>Visit-to-Wishlist Conversion: 20% </li> </ul> <h1>What I Did For This</h1> <p>I won&#39;t repeat myself too much, as I wrote about my prep before, but here&#39;s the gist:</p> <ol> <li>Updated the trailer.</li> <li>Updated the capsule art.</li> <li>Updated the store page description and screenshots.</li> <li>Pushed one more small demo update to fix a few minor issues.</li> </ol> <p>This was the absolute bare minimum I had to do for the store page.</p> <h1>What Else I Did (The &quot;Shameful&quot; Part)</h1> <p>As usual, I (insistently and shamelessly) begged people to play my game. I opened Twitch and sent a template message to <strong>about 50-70 streamers</strong> asking them to play my demo.</p> <p>This resulted in me <strong>getting temporarily banned from sending DMs on Twitch for a couple of days.</strong></p> <p>About <strong>5-6 people</strong> responded and actually played, which seems like a normal conversion rate. This included both Russian-speaking and English-speaking streamers.</p> <p>It felt super uncomfortable sending those messages, but I can always force myself to do it. This time I didn&#39;t use Discord or email. For some reason, Twitch DMs are the most effective (and lowest friction) channel for me. I only messaged streamers who had 40+ concurrent viewers.</p> <h1>Some &quot;Basic&quot; Advice About Next Fest</h1> <p>If you&#39;re planning to participate, you&#39;ll hear this advice. Here&#39;s my take on it:</p> <p><strong>&quot;Get your demo to at least 80% finished.&quot;</strong> This is 100% correct. Do it! People will try to play, and it will suck if their whole impression is ruined by bugs.</p> <p><strong>&quot;Prep your store page.&quot;</strong> Also correct. I watched streamers browse games. They click an interesting capsule, watch the trailer for 5 seconds, and skim the page. If it doesn&#39;t hook them, they&#39;re gone. I&#39;m sure players (with thousands of demos to choose from) do the exact same thing.</p> <p><strong>&quot;Harass people and ask them to play your demo.&quot;</strong> This is painfully correct. If you&#39;re an indie with no friends or publisher, some people might play your demo organically, but you can&#39;t count on any real results. Swallow your shame and start writing.</p> <p><strong>&quot;Don&#39;t join your first Next Fest. Wait until you have max wishlists.&quot;</strong> Correct. The number of impressions your demo gets is directly tied to your active players. More wishlists = more potential players = more visibility (in theory).</p> <p>All of this is great advice. Of course, none of us are actually going to follow all of it XD </p> <h1>How It Really Felt</h1> <p>Guys. <strong>It was awesome.</strong></p> <p>I genuinely loved all of it. People were playing, sending messages. A couple of times I opened Twitch and saw a streamer playing my game right in my &quot;recommended&quot; feed. One time I even jumped into the chat in real-time to help a streamer get to the end of the demo.</p> <p>The feedback was, classically, mixed. From the streams I watched, I&#39;d say 60-70% of players reached the end of the demo, which is fine. Overall, I got positive feedback. I&#39;m sure there were streams where people quit after 5 minutes, but I didn&#39;t see those. That&#39;s also normal. Some found the ending too dark; others were discussing the plot long after.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>This boost in attention has been a <strong>massive motivator</strong> and gives me some faith in a bright future. I absolutely <strong>do not regret</strong> joining this Next Fest right now, even though I made a ton of mistakes.</p> <p>Considering how hard it&#39;s been for me to sit down and work lately, and how low my expectations were, this was incredibly cool.</p> <p>I recommend it to everyone. And thanks to all of you for the advice you gave me before!</p> <p>Link to my game: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812640/When_eyes_close/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812640/When_eyes_close/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Old-Butterscotch8711"> /u/Old-Butterscotch8711 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohdtba/i_havent_been_able_to_get_any_real_work_done_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ohdtba/i_havent_been_able_to_get_any_real_work_done_on/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Anyways, at the time I just learned about libp2p, and tried to come up with a project that would simply abstract over the kademlia protocol so that I could understand both better.</p> <p>This is a rough idea of what I think I wanted, and I learned a lot about the language (especially while working with macros) and would like some feedback and advice s a beginner rust dev. I haven&#39;t been coding for very long so please forgive the code quality, but I have tried to use AI to document it to be as understandable as possible.</p> <p>I figure (in addition to adding complete functionality and other TODOS) that there are several areas I already know are a little weird:</p> <ul> <li>The overhead of the wrapper abstractions (esp redb) is crazier than I initially thought, so I will probably revisit those. Likely excessive cloning and multi threading bottlenecks I think.</li> <li>The API is not as ergonomic as I would like it. I used a bunch of other macros in the proc-macros that have led to weird hygiene issues.</li> <li>I&#39;m working on making PeerId persistence a little better.</li> </ul> <p>Please let me know where I can improve, and if possible, what I can read to get better at the idiomatic and optimisation aspects of rust.

Really liking it so far, great fun for the most part!</p> <p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed though, and have been thinking about for a while, is that a lot of rust projects don&#39;t seem to use comments as much as projects written in other languages. A lot of them will have barely an comments at all.</p> <p>This trend seemingly fits in with the style things are documented in general; most of the time you get reference docs of the API and a cursory intro into the thing in a readme style, but &quot;usage&quot; docs or &quot;how to&quot; sections are rarely used.</p> <p>I&#39;ve found myself having to dive deep into the source code to really understand what&#39;s going on way more in rust than I had with most other languages I&#39;m familiar with. </p> <p>One observation I find particularly interesting about this is that I don&#39;t this has something to do with a difference in personal preference in general, as I&#39;ve seen libraries written by the same team/person in a different language take a completely different approach to documenting than in rust.</p> <p>So. What do you think is it about rust that makes people at large not feel like writing comments and documentation? Have you noticed this as well? Do you perhaps notice a difference in your approach to this when writing rust versus another language?</p> <p>PS: Despite the title, I&#39;m asking this with a genuine curiosity and fondness of the language, I&#39;m not trying to do a &quot;rust bad&quot; here :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Interesting_Golf_529"> /u/Interesting_Golf_529 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oh86x9/why_do_yall_have_an_aversion_to_writing_comments/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oh86x9/why_do_yall_have_an_aversion_to_writing_comments/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey devs! </p> <p>I&#39;m working on a Rust-based game project and want to use Recast Navigation for crowd pathfinding, specifically via the recastnavigation-sys crate (which wraps the C++ lib with cmake and bindgen). The goal is to compile it to bare metal wasm32-unknown-unknown so I can run navmesh generation/querying server-side. But if I just clone <a href="https://github.com/andriyDev/recastnavigation-rs-sys">https://github.com/andriyDev/recastnavigation-rs-sys</a> and try to run: </p> <p><code>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/Users/wladpaiva/Developer/f/recastnavigation-rs-sys/wasm32-unknown-unknown.cmake cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown</code><br/> <br/> It says it cannot locate standard C library headers such as &lt;assert.h&gt;, &lt;math.h&gt;, &lt;string.h&gt;, &lt;stdlib.h&gt;, and &lt;stdio.h&gt; which is fair... it looks like it does not locate the sysroot but I have instructed the cmake to use wasi-libc.<br/> <br/> here&#39;s my cmake file:</p> <pre><code># --- wasm32-unknown-unknown.cmake --- set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic) set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR wasm32) # Compilers set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER &quot;/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang&quot;) set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER &quot;/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++&quot;) # Path to wasi-libc sysroot (Homebrew) set(WASI_SYSROOT &quot;/opt/wasi-sdk/share/wasi-sysroot&quot;) # Tell clang where to find headers set(WASM_INCLUDE_FLAGS &quot;-isystem${WASI_SYSROOT}&quot;) # Common compiler flags for wasm32-unknown-unknown set(WASM_COMMON_FLAGS &quot;--target=wasm32-unknown-unknown -nostdlib ${WASM_INCLUDE_FLAGS}&quot;) # Apply them forcibly to all C/C++ compilation set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT &quot;${WASM_COMMON_FLAGS}&quot;) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT &quot;${WASM_COMMON_FLAGS}&quot;) # Linker: don‚Äôt try to use host libraries set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT &quot;-nostdlib&quot;) # Tell CMake not to try running executables set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE STATIC_LIBRARY) # Print for debugging message(STATUS &quot;Using wasi-libc from: ${WASI_SYSROOT}&quot;) message(STATUS &quot;C flags: ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT}&quot;) </code></pre> <p> <br/> From this point, gpt and google is just not helpful anymore so Idk how to move forward. Should I implement a fake_libc or use any other lib? I&#39;m sure someone else has done something like this before. Any ideas would be much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wladpaiva"> /u/wladpaiva </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ohmh7x/help_needed_compiling_recastnavigationsys_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ohmh7x/help_needed_compiling_recastnavigationsys_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>
