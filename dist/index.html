The note generation is pretty simple and unimportant to my question: I&#39;m stepping through a text document and generating a note based on each parsed line of text. </p> <p><strong>Question</strong></p> <p>How can I make <strong>non-blocking, non-stuttering writes with an audio envelope</strong> to the Output Port? Essentially I would like to do &quot;the normal thing:&quot; play a note, let it fade out based on some arbitrary parameters, and have that be <em>entirely independent</em> of other notes playing. </p> <p><strong>Note on previous attempts</strong></p> <p>I&#39;ve played around with this and built solutions that either block a thread with a note, stutter when too many notes are played (due I believe to rapid lock acquire-release), or don&#39;t satisfy the borrow checker. I am happy to provide more details if anyone is interested. </p> <p><strong>Type of Answer I&#39;m Requesting</strong></p> <p>A fantastic solution to this question would be a pointer to a Rust low-latency MIDI generation library or application. <code>unsafe</code> is acceptable. A custom solution would be fantastic but is not at all expected of anyone. </p> <p>Many thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Blighttown_Again"> /u/Blighttown_Again </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ntzkv0/lowlatency_midi_programming/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ntzkv0/lowlatency_midi_programming/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Glommio has something similar - &quot;Sharding&quot; under channels, but it didn&#39;t allow that. So I had to fork glommio and implement IntoRawFd for GlommioStream to make it happen :)</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/utilitydelta-io/glommio-sharded-affinity-server-starter">https://github.com/utilitydelta-io/glommio-sharded-affinity-server-starter</a></p> <p>Super keen to hear any feedback on my architectural approaches!

Over the past year, I‚Äôve been focusing on Rust and Bevy, since my main goal is to make games. However, being 1 indie developer can be really challenging, so I‚Äôm reaching out here on Reddit to hopefully find some like-minded people who‚Äôd be interested in working together.</p> <p>I‚Äôve already worked with Bevy, though I‚Äôm still learning more about both Bevy and Rust as I go. Ideally, I‚Äôm looking for 2‚Äì3 other developers who‚Äôd be excited to join me. Any games we create will probably need some optimization, but I think that‚Äôs part of the fun and learning process.</p> <p>If we end up making money through itch.io (most likely itch.io), I‚Äôd split the earnings evenly between the team. To be clear, I know some people may think it‚Äôs silly for a 13-year-old to form a dev team, but I‚Äôm serious about this. If you don‚Äôt have anything constructive or encouraging to say, please just move on. What I do care about is finding teammates who want to build something cool together, regardless of age or location.</p> <p>Since my computer can‚Äôt handle Unity, I‚Äôd prefer we use Bevy with VS Code, or possibly Godot (though I don‚Äôt yet have experience in it).</p> <p>If you‚Äôre interested, I‚Äôd love for you to join.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We just released FFmate <a href="https://docs.ffmate.io/docs/release-notes#version-2-0-26-09-2025">2.0,</a> and with it we rewrote the entire codebase using <a href="https://goyave.dev/">Goyave</a>. For context: FFmate is an automation layer for FFmpeg with a job queue, REST API, watchfolders, presets, webhooks, and now <a href="https://docs.ffmate.io/docs/clustering">clustering support</a>. I wanted to share the reasoning behind this decision since I think it might be relevant for others building long-running Go apps.</p> <p>Our previous codebase was in a good state, but not perfect. Over time we ran into rare race conditions that were hard to reproduce and harder to test against. We had built and maintained our own framework, which we called sev framework. It had similarities to Goyave but never reached the same maturity.</p> <p>Although we invested a lot into making it scale and into keeping it contributor-friendly, we knew we wanted to do better. Version 2 felt like the right moment to make that change. Sooner rather than later.</p> <p>What we gained with Goyave:</p> <ul> <li>Built-in test framework and test utilities</li> <li>Data validation and type conversion out of the box</li> <li>A more reliable foundation with less custom code to maintain</li> </ul> <p>We also approached it with open eyes about the limitations:</p> <ul> <li>Configuration in Goyave is not thread safe</li> <li>It uses its own configuration interface</li> <li>Heavy reliance on interfaces (trade-off between flexibility and overhead)</li> </ul> <p>We cut about 2,000 lines, simplified the structure, and made room for new featuress. The biggest is cluster support. Clustering allows multiple FFmate instances to share a single Postgres queue, spread tasks across nodes, and keep running even if one node fails.</p> <p>If you‚Äôve done a similar rewrite or worked with Goyave in production, I‚Äôd like to hear your experience.</p> <p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate">https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href="https://docs.ffmate.io">https://docs.ffmate.io</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Soft_Potential5897"> /u/Soft_Potential5897 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nthner/why_we_rewrote_ffmate_with_goyave/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nthner/why_we_rewrote_ffmate_with_goyave/">[comments]</a></span></div>
