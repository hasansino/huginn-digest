            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the past three years, I have been working on Trane (<a href="https://github.com/trane-project/trane/">https://github.com/trane-project/trane/</a>), a deliberate practice engine that helps users master complex skills. I wanted to build something on top of it that would be useful to a wider audience and showcase its full potential. I learned about the literacy crisis and figured creating a literacy program would be cost-effective and impactful. After researching the science of reading and writing acquisition, I created Pictures Are For Babies, a literacy program that integrates Trane with a full curriculum to teach literacy to the college level and best-in-class pedagogy.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the amount of effort and time that had to go into this means the project must be commercial However, a Lite version available for free with no time limits and no payment required. The Full version aims to develop true mastery of literacy at the college level and beyond. The Full version is available via a $1000 one-time payment or a $20/month subscription with lifetime software and content updates included.</p> <p>The first version of the Full product includes the completed curriculum for reading and writing at the symbol, word, and sentence levels. Upcoming releases will add the remaining tracks of the curriculum, focused on reading comprehension of a variety of text types and explicit writing instruction at the sentence and paragraph levels.</p> <p>The Lite version includes the first levels of the curriculum. The value of the Lite version goes well beyond its content. By integrating the correct pedagogy from the ground up, it serves as a complete and professional tool for detection, prevention, and remediation of reading difficulties in early readers.</p> <p>Trane is built with rust and open-source and contributes to around 90% of all the code. The rest of the product consists of a UI built with dioxus and some extra code to embed the curriculum and handle licensing.</p> <p>I am happy to answer any questions about the product, how it was built, and about the science behind it.</p> <p>For screenshots of the software, please visit the user interface page at <a href="https://picturesareforbabies.com/manual/user-interface/">https://picturesareforbabies.com/manual/user-interface/.</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TraneProject"> /u/TraneProject </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://picturesareforbabies.com/home/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nklslv/pictures_are_for_babies_software_tutor_to_help/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is mainly targeted at the OpenRouter API, but it follows the OpenAI Chat Completions API so it also works with any server that follows the standard, like Ollama, vLLM, etc.</p> <p>I am a AI Engineer at my current job, which means I mostly use Python. However, with the rise of Python libraries written in Rust such as uv, ruff, pydantic, polars, etc. I&#39;ve been wanting to learn more about the Rust world, so I made orpheus as a learning project to dive into lifetimes, generics, async runtimes, traits, best practices for rust projects and the rust ecosystem in general.</p> <p>Here are some features that might interest you!</p> <ul> <li>Async support with tokio</li> <li>Streaming llm responses</li> <li>Selection from over 50 providers</li> <li>Image, PDF, and audio multimodality</li> <li>Model Fallbacks</li> <li>Web Search</li> <li>Tool Calling for Agents</li> <li>MCP Support</li> <li>Structured Outputs from llms</li> <li>Prompt Caching</li> </ul> <p>This project really made me fall in love with Rust, to the point I found it annoying to go back to Python for work (lol). My next priority with orpheus will be to create Python bindings with Pyo3!</p> <p>This is my first rust crate, so any feedback is welcome!

I have been pleasantly surprised by the feedback on my first post (to which I will reply when I have enough time): <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nguivf/best_way_to_build_a_gui_rust_project/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nguivf/best_way_to_build_a_gui_rust_project/</a> </p> <p>I will be involved in some research projects at my university while I am doing my PhD. I will work on these full time. More specifically I will be implementing and testing evolutive algorithms like genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation etc.</p> <p>I have done a project like this before for an assignment and used Rust. I really like Rust due to the expressiveness, safety compared to C/ C++ in which I have also done algorithms quite a bit and the handholding from the compiler.</p> <p>Besides that 1 week project, contributing to a small REST API and doing Leetcode in Rust, I have no practical experience on it. I have ~3 years experience of professional development (C#) and 9 total years of programming (C, C++, Java, Python). I have read a few chapters from the book, but at the time I didn&#39;t have much need or time to continue.</p> <p>What would you say it&#39;s &quot;safe&quot; for me to start working on the project without doing much more reading before? Can I just read what I need and improve while going?</p> <p>If I had infinite time I would read all the books page by page, but that is not practical as I would like to start working on the projects in a few weeks. Otherwise, I think my preferred way would be Brown University&#39;s fork of the book, as it also includes examples: <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/">https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/24online24"> /u/24online24 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nk4hki/start_working_on_a_project_before_reading_any/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nk4hki/start_working_on_a_project_before_reading_any/">[comments]</a></span></div>

RecoverCheck aims to mitigate this risk by scanning your codebase and flagging any goroutines that could potentially leave you vulnerable.</p> <h1>Features:</h1> <ul> <li>Detects goroutines without <code>recover</code></li> <li>Easy to integrate into your existing workflow</li> </ul> <h1>Reason behind creating it:</h1> <p>The application I am working has extensive use of goroutines and something we miss to add the recover function and that leads to goroutine panic, sometimes bringing the whole process down. We were not sure if there is any existing linter that checks for this. So we created this linter :)</p> <p>I would love to get your feedback on this tool. Any suggestions on features, improvements, or best practices would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Check it out on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/cksidharthan/recovercheck">RecoverCheck</a></p> <p>This code is the initial iteration as i wanted to have something quick. once all the edge cases are ironed out and if more people find it useful, I&#39;ll plan to submit a PR to golangci-lint to add this linter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry-Risk5512"> /u/Dry-Risk5512 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nkafeq/introducing_recovercheck_a_golang_linter_to_catch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nkafeq/introducing_recovercheck_a_golang_linter_to_catch/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I built the collision detection system on the same principle, and all physics calculations use SDFs.</p> <p>Since the initial idea was to cover as many platforms as possible, including web (honestly, now I&#39;m not even sure why I needed web support üòÖ), I chose wgpu as the graphics API, winit as the window manager, and matchbox as the networking library (a WebRTC wrapper that lets you send packets from the browser like over UDP. This is necessary for high-speed network packet transmission in action shooters).</p> <p>Even though I dropped web support after a while, WebRTC stayed, which created additional challenges later when building game servers. Switching technologies mid-development would have taken too long.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been developing the game on this stack for two years, handling everything myself‚Äîfrom physics engine code to drawing UI in GIMP. Deadlines got moved multiple times, but in the end, I managed to finish the game (at least as a playable prototype).</p> <p>Toward the end of development, I decided to release all the game code openly under the AGPL-3.0 license. If players and the community show interest in this project and I can secure funding to work on it full-time‚ÄîI&#39;ll continue development.</p> <p>What I ended up with‚Äîsee below.<br/> <a href="https://maffi44.itch.io/slice4d">Additional information on website</a><br/> <a href="https://youtu.be/yeCqfqE4ylk?feature=shared">Trailer on Youtube</a><br/> <a href="https://youtu.be/Pl355uSTBLc?si=Z_ZOoEUuSkhI5vOx">Video-tutorial on Youtube</a><br/> <a href="https://github.com/maffi44/slice-4d-shooter">Source code on Github</a><br/> <a href="https://maffi44.itch.io/slice4d">Itch.io page with build for windows</a><br/> (For other platforms, you have to build it yourself from the source code)</p> <p>video</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maffi44maffi44"> /u/maffi44maffi44 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1nkao65/i_quit_my_job_to_build_a_multiplayer_shooter_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1nkao65/i_quit_my_job_to_build_a_multiplayer_shooter_in/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
