            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Learning Math is, to most people, a challenge and, to many, a fearsome thing. In large measure that&#39;s because, in most schools, teachers are tied to a curriculum and required to progress through it at a proscribed rate regardless of how well their students are learning. Students have to keep up or not, the teacher has to keep moving from topic to topic or face the ire of the school&#39;s administration. From a student&#39;s perspective, he or she is constantly being asked to learn new skills well before the previous skills have actually been mastered. That makes math frustrating and scary. The system is broken, but the app this post is all about -- <a href="https://github.com/jtreagan/Question-Bank-Creator"><strong>Question Bank Creator</strong></a> -- will help make life easier for students in their learning and for parents and teachers as they try to help those students, even if they are forced to work within a broken system. You can read an article about <a href="https://github.com/jtreagan/Question-Bank-Creator/blob/master/Appeal%20for%20help.md">Question Bank Creator <strong>here</strong></a> or go to its repository (linked above) to learn more. With this post I&#39;m hoping to connect with Rust coders who are willing to contribute some of their time to help with the project. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/jtreagan/Question-Bank-Creator/blob/master/README.md"><strong>Readme.md</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/jtreagan/Question-Bank-Creator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"><strong>Contributing.md</strong></a> files to learn more. Then take a look at the identified issues, do a pull request, and make a difference. Your help will be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ambitious-Ad-7307"> /u/Ambitious-Ad-7307 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o9gl9r/question_bank_creator_help_for_parents_teachers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o9gl9r/question_bank_creator_help_for_parents_teachers/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When desktop applications need a GUI, why isn&#39;t a simple local webserver + web frontend combo used as a viable option more frequently? </p> <p>To me, I see the ability of using a webserver (Axum, Actix, etc) + web frontends (HTML/CSS + js framework, wasm, etc - whatever your heart desires) to offer a lot of flexibility in approach, and far more useful to learn long term. Web development skills here seem to provide a lot more overlap and general utility than learning something more specialized, and would promote better maintainability. </p> <hr/> <p>What advantages does something like Tauri offer if I know I&#39;m only targeting desktop applications? I see Tauri as a limiting factor in some ways.<br/> 1. Current methods for backend &lt;-&gt; frontend data transfers are pretty limited in both implementation and somewhat in design (poor performance due to js, more so than is true for standard web pages), <em>and</em> I have to learn additional Tauri-specific methods/approaches which are not useful outside of Tauri. Why not use the plethora of existing web standards for data transfer?<br/> 2. Tauri is also pretty limited for Linux, as it requires the use of WebKitGTK as the only browser option, which doesn&#39;t support a lot of common modern browser standards. Even if there aren&#39;t features lacking, the performance is truly abysmal.<br/> 3. Tauri faces false positives for Windows virus/malware recognition. This is a pretty big deal, and supposedly Tauri devs can&#39;t do anything to fix it. 4. As Tauri is still somewhat new overall as a project, documentation for it is somewhat lacking. It&#39;s far from the worst documented FOSS project out there, but it definitely needs additional clarity when doing anything beyond basic tasks.</p> <p>What advantages would something like QT offer? To me, It seems like QT is more limiting in terms of possibilities. It ties me exclusively to desktop designs, and the knowledge is less transferable to other projects and technologies. </p> <p>And while this is explicitly not Rust related (but is 100% in line with the rest of the context here), why is Electron preferred over a local webserver + web page in the first place? The only real advantage I can see is easier filesystem access, and that the program behaves/looks like a desktop app instead of opening in the browser. I know the former can be solved, and it seems like as a community we could&#39;ve solved the latter as well (without choosing the nuclear option of pure WebView only). There&#39;s also some value in having a standardized browser to target, but this is far less of an issue today than in the past. </p> <hr/> <p>It seems to me that the only major downsides to the approach of a local webserver + web frontend are:</p> <ol> <li>Runs in the browser instead of as a separate desktop application. Again, I think this could be fixable if there was a demand for it - effectively it&#39;d be similar to WebView/Electron/Tauri in nature, in that the browser of choice would have a launch option/mode for running without full browser options or menus - just a minimal web page running distinctly from other browser processes already open.</li> <li>Arguably insecure from a privacy perspective, as anything on the local computer would have access to see APIs and other traffic between the frontend and backend of the program. I would argue this isn&#39;t a major point as it operates on the premise of a compromised environment in the first place, but it is perhaps something which is more exposed than when compared to other desktop GUI approaches.<br/></li> <li>Tauri for example can bundle and package the final product up very nicely in a single executable or appimage when completed. This is really convenient and easy. Doing this manually with something like axum + web frontend is still possible, but requires a bit more configuration and effort.<br/></li> </ol> <p>Am I overlooking anything else? All I really see are positives and upsides, giving me far greater flexibility along with way more resources to achieve what I want. But when I search for this concept, I don&#39;t find too many examples of this. When I do find relevant discussions, most people point to Tauri, which I find to be a confusing suggestion. Other than Tauri resembling a standard desktop app more closely, it seems to be more like a limitation rather than a genuine benefit to me. Why is my opinion seemingly a seldom held one? Are there any projects which are targeted at what I&#39;m after already, without the added limitations from something like Tauri?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DesperateCourt"> /u/DesperateCourt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o996t7/why_shouldnt_i_use_a_local_webserver_htmlcssjs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o996t7/why_shouldnt_i_use_a_local_webserver_htmlcssjs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t use GORM but I want to use it or something like it, if better. Here&#39;s my beef. To date, the best ORM tool was LINQ-SQL in C#. I want something like it in Go. LINQ stood for &quot;Language Integrated Query&quot;. What did it do that set it apart from all other ORM&#39;s? You got compile time (realtime) type safetly on dynamic sql. You never had a string in your code referring to a column name.</p> <p>When I finally saw that GORM suppported generics I did a quick dive into the documentation, but I still saw the code riddled with character strings referencing database columns. That means it requires an integration test vs a pure unit test to validate your code. Blechhh.</p> <p>LINQ does this by having anonymous types created by both the compiler and IDE while the developer is writing code. Essentially. LINQ was the closest thing to a 4GL implemented in a 3GL developer experience.</p> <p>I&#39;ve rolled my own ORMs for specific Db&#39;s by writing ad/hoc code-generators for specific dbs. Defined generic interfaces etc... THe code generator takes care of looking at all the tables/column/pks and generating code to implement the interfaces you&#39;d expect in granular db record CRUD.</p> <p>But what I can&#39;t solve in Go, is the ability to map JOIN&#39;s to a new data type on-the-fly. Often we write code that needs columns/fields/aggregations from multiple tables into a single structure. I don&#39;t want to have to go off and create a new artifact to describe such a natural thing in normalized database development.</p> <p>Does any understand what I&#39;m talking about?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kimbonics"> /u/kimbonics </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o9fnk6/thoughts_on_the_latest_gorm_with_generics/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o9fnk6/thoughts_on_the_latest_gorm_with_generics/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>After the post on performances a couple of days ago, I wanted to share another maybe counter intuitive, habit I have, I will use as an example a very small parsing library I made called flash-flags.</p> <p>I know that someone might think ‚Äòif a simple parser has ~95% coverage isn‚Äôt fuzzing a time waste?</p> <p>I used to think the same Unit Test are great for the happy paths, edge, concurrent and integration scenario but I found out that fuzz testing is the only way to find the ‚Äòunknwown‚Äô.</p> <p>My test suite proved that Flash Flags worked great for all the input I could imagine but the fuzz test proved what happened with the millions of input I couldn‚Äôt imagine like --port=%¬ß$! (Who would think of that?!?!), very long arguments or random Unicode characters. For a library that had to be the backbone of my CLI apps I didn‚Äôt want to take that risk.</p> <p>So after being satisfied with the coverage I wrote </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agilira/flash-flags/blob/main/fuzz_test.go">https://github.com/agilira/flash-flags/blob/main/fuzz_test.go</a>. </p> <p>This test launches millions of combinations of malformed arguments to the parser to make sure that it wouldn‚Äôt go to panic and that it would gracefully handle errors.</p> <p>Did it find any critical, application crashing, bug? No, but it did find dozens of tiny, slimy edge cases and ‚Äòunhandeled states‚Äô that would have led to unpredictable behavior.</p> <p>This process took me a week but it made the library not just ‚Äòok‚Äô but ‚Äòanti-fragile‚Äô.</p> <p>So fuzz testing is useless if you have a good coverage? No, in my opinion is one of the most valuable tool we can use to transform a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô library/app into a production-ready one, especially for something as fundamental as flag parsing.</p> <p>I also applied this process to my other libraries and all the times it took me between 2 days and a week but I think it‚Äôs really worth it.</p> <p>You can see how I applied the same principles to other libraries with few differences for example:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agilira/argus/blob/main/argus_fuzz_test.go">https://github.com/agilira/argus/blob/main/argus_fuzz_test.go</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/agilira/orpheus/blob/main/pkg/orpheus/orpheus_fuzz_test.go">https://github.com/agilira/orpheus/blob/main/pkg/orpheus/orpheus_fuzz_test.go</a></p> <p>It takes time, but it makes the final product more robust and dependable.</p> <p>I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on fuzz testing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Superb_Ad7467"> /u/Superb_Ad7467 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o9a6bz/why_i_spent_a_week_fuzz_testing_a_go_flag_parser/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o9a6bz/why_i_spent_a_week_fuzz_testing_a_go_flag_parser/">[comments]</a></span></div>
