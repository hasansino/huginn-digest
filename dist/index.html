            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone. I recently joined Reddit (and this subreddit) and just wanted to tell you all about how I earned my first dollar with a video game.</p> <p>A few months ago, while waiting for some sprites for my main project, I downloaded Ren&#39;Py. I had never used it before and just wanted to see how it worked. I ended up making a very short visual novel called <strong>&quot;Ass Effect: Liara T&#39;Soni,&quot;</strong> which basically consisted of... well, having sex with Liara from Mass Effect.</p> <p>It was a project I put together over a weekend with absolutely no ambition or marketing behind it. I&#39;m not even sure if I should call it &#39;practice&#39; because it was more of a playful experiment on my part, but I uploaded it to <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a> anyway. I didn&#39;t even bother to translate it properly; I uploaded a second &quot;English version&quot; which, by the way, was also poorly translated, and I only realized it three months later! LOL.</p> <p>Anyway, I got about 800 views and 30 downloads, and among them... I received a donation that translated into one dollar in earnings!</p> <p>I know that amount is basically nothing, but it made me incredibly happy. Feeling that someone valued your little &quot;experiment&quot; enough to give you money for it is an amazing feeling. So, maybe the solution to selling games is to make them all NSFW and give the option to name your character Hitler.</p> <p>Now, tell me! How did <em>you</em> earn your first dollar developing games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Novel-Sheepherder365"> /u/Novel-Sheepherder365 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oh4mrl/i_earned_my_first_dollar_developing_video_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1oh4mrl/i_earned_my_first_dollar_developing_video_games/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>---</p> <p><em>(By Team Empreintes, a small indie studio in Angoul√™me ‚Äì FR)</em></p> <p>---</p> <h1>Why this post?</h1> <p>Our studio‚Äôs direction can be described along two axes:</p> <p>- Exploring the possibilities opened up by creating non-violent games.</p> <p>- Making games where the design itself is the vehicle of the message we want to express (I explain this below).</p> <p>We believe that what makes video games distinct from other media is the interaction between human and software:</p> <p>The deepest messages are conveyed by how one plays, not just what one reads or hears when playing. In short, the main message of the game is carried first by the system and then by the narrative.</p> <p>Our first game, Fireside Feelings, came out of a corollary question:</p> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúHow can we foster empathy between players through game design?‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>This post tells how we attempted to answer that, what we failed at, what we found, and what we learnt about creation and about listening people.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>Who we are</h1> <p>We are Team Empreintes, a small horizontally-structured team based in Angoul√™me, in the South-West of France.</p> <p>In practice, there are two of us: Jaximus and me, Vidu.</p> <p>We do everything together, sometimes awkwardly, often passionately.</p> <p>We began developing games around 2020, and in June 2025, during the Wholesome Direct, we released our first ‚Äúofficial‚Äù game: Fireside Feelings.</p> <p>Today, we are working on our second project: The Granny Detective Society.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>Which game are we talking about?</h1> <p>Fireside Feelings is an asynchronous conversational game.</p> <p>The principle is simple:</p> <p>you pick a topic, you create your character, you sit by a fire with another player and respond.</p> <p>But the discussion is not in real time.</p> <p>When you see the other player‚Äôs answer, it is actually that player‚Äôs answer from their play-through, when they answered the question themselves.</p> <p>This time-offset is in part the key to the game:</p> <blockquote> <p>no pressure, no performance, no expectation of an immediate reply.</p> </blockquote> <p>Just the time to think and to be sincere.</p> <p>But it took us a long way to arrive here.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>Thinking about game-design as a framework for empathy</h1> <p>At the start, we began with this idea:</p> <blockquote> <p>&gt; ‚ÄúHuman behaviours depend on the framework in which they evolve.</p> </blockquote> <p>So how can we create a framework that favours the emergence of empathy?‚Äù</p> <p>So we experimented a lot.</p> <p>First, we wanted to eliminate all form of performance:</p> <blockquote> <p>no score, no likes, no view-count.</p> </blockquote> <p>We wanted to clarify the frame so it was obvious you were there for two things:</p> <ol> <li>To deposit yourself, share your thoughts, your emotions, after reflection.</li> <li>To receive, listen to what someone else has deposited before you, without judging, without arguing.</li> </ol> <p>When you read someone‚Äôs testimony, that person will never know they shared it with you. You are alone facing a small piece of humanity, sincere and fragile. And all we ask is that you welcome it.</p> <p>Then, we worked on total anonymity. At first the pseudonyms remained visible and some people recognised each other. That broke the magic, the sense of intimacy, the ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù. So we anonymised absolutely everything, including the avatar design, to avoid players posting images of the characters to find their owners.</p> <p>Also, our players embody anthropomorphic animals, to neutralise physical or social assumptions, while preserving expressive warmth. We wanted the characters to give an emotional colour rather than a social origin.</p> <p>We also added trigger warnings, not to censor, but to allow everyone to navigate between sensitivities, without being exposed to painful narratives.</p> <p>Finally, we blocked the possibility to modify one‚Äôs answer after reading another player‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a small detail, but it changes everything: you write what you feel, not what you think you should say. You don‚Äôt react: you express.</p> <p>And above all, we insisted on being totally transparent: this is not a chat, nor an AI. It‚Äôs a human exchange system: giving and receiving. And this is told to the player as soon as they arrive in the game and several times during their experience.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>The contagion of sincerity</h1> <p>What we hadn‚Äôt anticipated, however, was how contagious sincerity can be. In the game, all answers are hand-moderated, and what we learnt to look for in our moderation were messages that were sincere, affirmed, intimate.</p> <p>Because we observed that sincerity is contagious.</p> <p>Indeed, for every new player confronted with an entry thus moderated, we observed roughly the same phenomenon: initially responses are short, shy. Then, message after message, they lengthen, deepen, become personal. And thus become high-quality responses. Even at a festival ( in the noise, standing up, surrounded ) we saw players pause, breathe, and write moving texts.</p> <p>That is when we said to ourselves: damn, this is so cool, the set up works. The context dictates the behaviour.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>Finding the right mediator</h1> <p>One of our big early project blind spots was that we hadn‚Äôt thought our frame through properly.</p> <p>At first we tried to imitate a classic discussion: a character asked a question, responded, triggered another‚Ä¶ But everything felt fake.</p> <p>Two things were missing:</p> <p>- an anchor point from one discussion to the next,</p> <p>- a moderator to put players on equal footing.</p> <p>One day, as we had written to Mathew of Wholesome Games to introduce our game, he told us a key phrase:</p> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúFind someone or something that guides the discussion, not participates in it.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>And everything clicked.</p> <p>We created Spark, a small flame that lives in each camp-fire. Spark doesn‚Äôt judge, doesn‚Äôt debate: it listens, links voices, gives rhythm. It became the heart of the game. From there, everything opened up.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>External reward and internal reward</h1> <p>One of our objectives was thus to create a space favouring well-being. In both senses of the word. Acting well and feeling well.</p> <p>Our first reflex was to ‚Äúreward kindness‚Äù, to create an external motivation pushing toward benevolence. So we added a gift system: little shooting stars you could give to a player whose answer you liked.</p> <p>On paper, it was seductive. But very quickly, people began writing to receive gifts. And sincerity disappeared.</p> <p>We discussed this with Ziba of PopCannibal (Kind Words), who told us:</p> <blockquote> <p>‚ÄúWhen I want to add a feature, I ask myself how social networks would do it‚Ä¶ and then I do the opposite.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>That phrase served as our compass. We needed instead to remove all form of competition, all form of performance race, all form of external motivation to let the player develop internal motivations. Stronger and healthier.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>What moderation taught us about people</h1> <p>I won‚Äôt go into the details of the moderation system here (maybe in another post if people are interested), but you should know that all responses are read and hand-moderated, by two persons.</p> <p>We wanted to avoid becoming slaves to our own game, while keeping a human link in the process.</p> <p>But overall, we were extremely surprised at how much players grasped, wholeheartedly and spontaneously, the idea of self-moderating their content. Let me explain. When you finish a conversation, you can take a Polaroid photo. Then, all your Polaroids are pasted above your bed and you can reread your conversations. And when you click on a Polaroid, you can assign a trigger-warning to your conversation.</p> <p>It‚Äôs quite badly thought and tedious, honestly, we didn‚Äôt really count on it. But regardless, we realised that a large majority of players themselves filled in their own trigger warnings. Without any external motivation, people took care of one another.</p> <p>Small aside from a more personal point of view: having read hundreds of messages, we understood something simple and immense:</p> <blockquote> <p>&gt; On a very deep level, everyone wants the same thing.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be listened to, understood, loved. For the people they care about to be happy and healthy.</p> <p>Our common values are far closer than what social networks and the press let us believe. It might seem a little na√Øve, but it‚Äôs an idea that has deeply marked me.</p> <p>---</p> <h1>So, does it pay off?</h1> <p>Yes and no.</p> <p>(-) The launch was a bit chaotic. Our publisher chose a shadow drop of the game, without a real marketing campaign before, during or after. Before the launch, we had barely 2,000 wishlists.</p> <p>(+) But thanks to the Wholesome Direct, the community took over. And the reception was overwhelming.</p> <p>Players wrote to us that it was ‚Äúthe game of their life‚Äù. Others thanked us for having ‚Äúmade the internet softer, if only for a moment‚Äù. A journalist told us she only had one thing to look forward to each evening: entering the game‚Äôs bubble of softness.</p> <p>We also saw an unexpected echo from the furry and VTubing communities. I spent hours chatting with members of these communities on Discord, and I discovered there a kindness and depth I hadn‚Äôt imagined.</p> <p>Today, Fireside Feelings is:</p> <p>~3,500 sales</p> <p>~20,000 wishlists (entirely organic)</p> <p>98% positive reviews on Steam</p> <p>It‚Äôs not the game that will make us financially safe, but it‚Äôs so much more than that.</p> <p>---</p> <p>What we‚Äôre taking away from this experience</p> <p>&gt; The framework creates the behaviour. If you want kindness, design for it.</p> <p>&gt; Transparency creates trust. The clearer you are, the freer people feel.</p> <p>&gt; Performance and competition carry a form of violence. They can have their place, but only if they are chosen deliberately.</p> <p>&gt; And above all:</p> <p>It‚Äôs the first time in our lives as artists that we release a project and simply feel proud of its impact. Even if some parts of the game are awkward, even if some drawings make us wince, we know we will never be ashamed of having made this game. And that‚Äôs a fabulous feeling.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Thank you for reading all the way !</p> <p>If the topic interests you, I could write another post about sustainable human moderation by two people. And if you‚Äôd like to discuss it, it would be with great pleasure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Vidu_BCM"> /u/Vidu_BCM </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ogs96y/what_trying_to_create_empathy_in_a_game_taught_us/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ogs96y/what_trying_to_create_empathy_in_a_game_taught_us/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!</p> <p>TL;DWR (= don&#39;t wanna read) - this is announcing the initial public release of Amble, a data-driven text adventure game engine + scripting language/compiler + developer tooling + full playable demo game. You can find it with quickstart instructions at the <a href="https://github.com/pygmy-twylyte/amble">main Amble repository on GitHub</a>.</p> <p><strong>What is Amble, and... well, why?</strong></p> <p>Amble is a full-featured 100% data-driven game engine for text adventure or interactive fiction games, but includes a full suite of development tools (a DSL for game content that is compiled into TOML used by the engine, a language server, building and packaging tools, a tree-sitter parser and full Zed editor extension) and a moderately sized demo game to show some of what the engine can do.</p> <p><strong><em>But \</em>why* would you create a *text adventure* engine</strong>* <strong><em>and all this stuff?</em></strong></p> <p>This started because I wanted to learn Rust. I first created the `gametools` crate as a starter project, and when I ran dry on ideas for that, I decided to work on something that would *use* that crate somehow. The next natural idea was a text game using the &quot;spinners&quot; module from the `gametools` crate.</p> <p>It has just blown up from there as I became more comfortable with Rust, parser libraries, etc. As I developed the demo game content, whenever I&#39;d run into something I&#39;d want to be able to do and couldn&#39;t, I&#39;d go back and build the capability into the engine. Eventually it became way too complex to reasonably flex the abilities of the engine writing content directly in TOML, so the amble_script DSL was born. Well, then it was really annoying authoring content in the DSL without syntax highlighting, so... you see where this is going.</p> <p><strong>Engine Features (non-exhaustive)</strong></p> <ul> <li>100% data driven -- drop in different content, have a completely different game</li> <li>Two stage loader -- validates all symbols and references during load</li> <li>Map of arbitrary size and rooms with arbitrary numbers of connections which can be conditional and changed entirely via triggers during gameplay, making it possible to dynamically alter individual locations and the entire map according to game state and events.</li> <li>Items that can be consumable (single or multi-use) and can have special abilities, or require other items to have special abilities to interact with them (e.g. &quot;fuse&quot; requires an item with &quot;ignite&quot; capability to &quot;burn&quot;.) Items can contain other items and be nested infinitely (or at least up to max `usize`).</li> <li>NPCs with dialogue, moods/states, and can be static or move by routes or randomly within a prescribed area</li> <li>Triggers: these form the heart of the engine and allow you to make the game world, items and characters react in a broad variety of ways to player actions and detected gameplay situations.</li> <li>Scheduling system: can schedule (or trigger conditional) events on future turns, and they can be automatically rescheduled or cancelled if conditions no longer apply. Scheduled events can even schedule other events, making branching story event chains easy to create.</li> <li>View module that aggregates all messages / feedback from the engine and displays them in styled and organized frames each turn</li> <li>User-definable themes for styling and coloring of all game elements</li> <li>Goal / Achievement and Help systems</li> <li>Save/Load -- complete world state is saved, so loading a game restores all flags, NPC positions, puzzles, scheduled events, inventories -- everything.</li> <li>Broad unit / integration test coverage (but not full, I admit.)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Developer Niceties</strong></p> <ul> <li>custom, intuitive English-like language to define world entities and triggers (an extensive creators guide and cheat sheet are included)</li> <li>a full Zed extension with syntax highlighting, outlining, diagnostics, autocomplete, symbol renaming, goto definition -- the works.</li> <li>xtask crate to simplify content refreshes, engine rebuilds, distribution packaging</li> <li>in-game developer commands (feature must be enabled at build time) to allow teleporting, scheduled event and flag manipulation, item spawns, and more.</li> <li>extensive logging of game state changes and triggers fired can be enabled</li> </ul> <h1>BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GAME?</h1> <p>If you don&#39;t care about any of that but are interested in playing the game demo, quickstart instructions are toward the top of the README on the <a href="https://github.com/pygmy-twylyte/amble">main repo page</a> on GitHub. I&#39;ve tested it extensively in a variety of terminals on Linux, done very limited testing using Wine on a Windows build, and not at all on Mac (though it should work fine, in theory.)</p> <p>In developing the content, I just wanted to pack it with as many references as I could to things I enjoy while still being somewhat coherent. So, you&#39;ll find the following themes throughout:</p> <ul> <li>absurdist humor (Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide, Discworld, Monty Python)</li> <li>various sci-fi universes</li> <li>Portal (the game)</li> <li>Frank Zappa</li> </ul> <p><strong>Final Bit...</strong></p> <p>If you actually read this far, thanks. I&#39;m interested in any and all contributions and feedback. I&#39;ve been an amateur programmer since 6502 assembly and Pascal were cutting-edge, and I&#39;m always happy to get helpful / constructive advice from the pros who really know what they&#39;re doing!</p> <p>I&#39;m not much of a front-end developer. The UI is passable and very playable, but I was careful to keep all display logic in the View module so it can be nuked and repaved, hopefully without having to do much to the rest of the engine. So, if someone&#39;s really good with TUIs, I&#39;d love for you to take a look.</p> <p>For those who care about such things: AI definitely contributed to this project. I wrote the amble_engine, the REPL and DSL grammars, and all of the demo game content nearly 100% myself by hand, but leaned pretty heavily on Codex and Claude to help with tests, the DSL compiler, the language server and documentation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/djvbmd"> /u/djvbmd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oh4ct8/amble_enginedsl_and_zed_extension_opening_to_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1oh4ct8/amble_enginedsl_and_zed_extension_opening_to_the/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ogo351/now_that_i_know_rust_after_doing_several_projects/" target="_blank">Now that I know Rust after doing several projects (most web microservices), I can say with confidence, I can easily use Rust for all back-end related tasks as I do with Go and Python for the last 8 years working as Senior Back-end Dev (Today I'm Staff SWE focused at back-end and distributed system).</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is something that I wasn&#39;t confident when started to enjoy Rust, for the context. I worked mostly using golang for the last 8 years in fintechs, big tech, startups etc, most of the time Go + a legacy codebase in Java, PHP, Python etc.</p> <p>The thing was, a language without GC would still be productive? And after using Rust I started to get very comfort with writing the code without getting into any trouble, sure the async model is not as easy as in Go or modern Java with virtual threads, but it is literally the same async colored functions that we use in Python, old Java, PHP, and several other languages for years, it is definitely easy and is not the big deal.</p> <p>Most of the work in my domain that is distributed systems and back-end, is just concurrency code, IO bound, and Rust with Tokio is great for this, same great performance that I achieve with Go, but even more safe because the code is always checked to be thread safe and doesn&#39;t have race conditions.</p> <p>And sure, we don&#39;t have many problems using Go like people who never work with it exaggerates, I never miss a sleep for a null pointer, and was rare to see someone creating race conditions problems, but at the same time, after you learn Rust, you&#39;re learning way more consistent to be better at concurrency thinking about thread safe and preventing race conditions than using Go, and naturally you will become a more efficient software engineer. And even working with very experienced SWE in Go and Java, you came to a point where you cannot continue to get better unless you start to use C++ or drop the GC, so if the curve after learning is pretty much the same (serious, 99% of our job as back-end is calling apis, db, and create concurrent workers to process something async) you definitely can be productive using Rust for this as in any other language, the crates are very mature already, but you&#39;re choosing a path that will let always grow in efficiency as SWE (for the cost of maybe one or two days more to build a feature).</p> <p>I already take my decision, I will and already am using Rust for all back-end related and I just use Go or Python if I don&#39;t have the Rust runtime like Google cloud function (I don&#39;t know if they finally added support) or things like this, otherwise I truly believe Rust should be the main language for general back-end, even in startups that need to move fast, is still fast, because the majority of startups like I said, the work is just calling apis, db, and creating workers etc, no big deal, people just love to pretend that is a complex work when it&#39;s not, the complexity is very outside the code in design the solutions for distributed systems, and for that, Rust is just fine and let you become each day more efficient as SWE building better software.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/swordmaster_ceo_tech"> /u/swordmaster_ceo_tech </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ogo351/now_that_i_know_rust_after_doing_several_projects/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ogo351/now_that_i_know_rust_after_doing_several_projects/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Most modern systems are not just code that executes queries, but sequences of actions that must be performed atomically and restored in case of failure. This is not about business logic within a single function, but about process orchestration chains of steps where each operation can end in an error requiring compensation.</p> <p>This task is solved by the Saga pattern, one of the most complex and important architectural patterns. It describes how to perform a series of distributed rollback operations without resorting to global transactions.</p> <h1>The Problem</h1> <p>Manually implementing orchestration usually quickly turns into chaos. Errors have to be handled cascadingly, rollback logic is spread across the code, and attempts to add custom confirmation or parallel branches make the system unpredictable.<br/> On the other hand, there are mature platforms like Temporal or Cadence. They are reliable, but require the deployment of an entire infrastructure: brokers, workers, DSLs, and make a simple process dependent on an external ecosystem.<br/> Between these extremes Floxy appeared -- an embedded library on Go that implements the Saga pattern with orchestration, compensation, and interactive steps, without external services and heavy runtime.</p> <h1>The Philosophy of Floxy</h1> <p>Floxy is based on a simple idea: workflow is a part of the program, not a separate service. Instead of a dedicated platform with RPC and brokers, Floxy offers a library in which the business process is described using regular Go code - without a new language or YAML files. Basic principles:</p> <ol> <li>Minimalism. Everything is built around context.Context, pgx, and simple data structures.</li> <li>Predictability. Any state is stored in PostgreSQL; the behavior is deterministic.</li> <li>Isolation. All tables are created in the workflows schema without interfering with the application logic.</li> <li>Orchestration as a library. Saga, retry, rollback, and human-in-the-loop are available without an external runtime.</li> <li>Versioning. Each workflow template has a version number, ensuring the safe development of processes.</li> </ol> <h1>Key Features</h1> <p>Floxy implements a full set of functions for building reliable orchestrations:<br/> - Saga with orchestration and compensation. Each step can have an OnFailure handler that performs rollback or compensation.<br/> - SavePoint. Partial rollback to the last saved point.<br/> - Conditional steps. Logic branches using Go templates -- without an external DSL.<br/> - Parallel / Fork / Join. Parallel execution branches and subsequent synchronization.<br/> - Human-in-the-loop. Support for steps that require human intervention (confirm, reject).<br/> - Cancel and Abortion. Soft cancellation or immediate shutdown of workflow.<br/> - Idempotency-aware steps. The execution context (StepContext) provides the IdempotencyKey() method, which helps developers implement secure operations.<br/> - Migrations are embedded via go:embed. Floxy is completely self-sufficient and has the function of applying migrations.</p> <h1>Architecture</h1> <p>Floxy is a library with simple but expressive abstractions:</p> <ol> <li>Store is a layer for storing templates, template instances, states, and events (PostgreSQL via pgx).</li> <li>Builder is a workflow template builder</li> <li>Engine - executor and coordinator of steps: plans, rolls back, repeats, synchronizes.</li> <li>Worker Pool - a background pool that processes a queue of steps.</li> <li>Each step is performed in a context (context.Context), and the background worker checks the workflow_cancel_requests table in order to interrupt long-running steps in a timely manner.</li> </ol> <h1>Workflow as a Graph</h1> <p>A workflow in Floxy is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps defined through the built-in Builder API.<br/> The Builder creates an adjacency list structure, checks for cycles, and serializes the description to JSON for storage in workflow_definitions.</p> <p><code>wf, _ := floxy.NewBuilder(&quot;order&quot;, 1).</code><br/> <code>Step(&quot;reserve_stock&quot;, &quot;stock.Reserve&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Then(&quot;charge_payment&quot;, &quot;payment.Charge&quot;).</code><br/> <code>OnFailure(&quot;refund&quot;, &quot;payment.Refund&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Step(&quot;send_email&quot;, &quot;notifications.Send&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Build()</code></p> <p>If the Builder detects a cycle, Build() returns an error, ensuring the graph is correct even before the flow is run in the engine.</p> <h1>Versioning and Isolation</h1> <p>Each workflow template is stored with a version number. When updating a template, the developer must increment the version number. This ensures that running instances continue to execute according to their original schema.<br/> All Floxy tables are located in a separate workflows schema, including the workflow_instances, workflow_steps, workflow_events, and workflow_definitions tables, among others. This ensures complete isolation and simplifies integration into existing applications.</p> <h1>Human-in-the-loop</h1> <p>Floxy supports interactive steps (StepTypeHuman) that pause execution and wait for a user decision.<br/> The workflow enters the waiting_decision state, and the decision (confirmed or rejected) is written to the workflow_human_decisions table. After this, the engine either continues execution or terminates the process with an error.<br/> Thus, Floxy can be used not only for automated processes but also for scenarios requiring confirmation, review, or manual control.</p> <h1>Cancel and Abort</h1> <p>Floxy supports two stopping mechanisms:<br/> - Cancel - rolls back to the root (save points are ignored),<br/> - Abort - immediately terminates execution without compensation.</p> <p>Both options are initiated by adding an entry to the workflow_cancel_requests table. The background worker periodically polls it and calls context.CancelFunc() for active steps of the corresponding instance.</p> <h1>Tests and Examples</h1> <p>Floxy is covered by a large number of unit and integration tests that use testcontainers to automatically deploy PostgreSQL in a container. This ensures the engine operates correctly in all scenarios: from simple sequential flows to complex parallel and compensation processes.<br/> Furthermore, the repository contains numerous examples (./examples) demonstrating various step types, the use of OnFailure, branches, conditions, human-in-the-loop scenarios, and the rollback policy. This makes getting started with the project simple and intuitive, even for Go newbies.<br/> Furthermore, the repository is equipped with extensive documentation and PlantUML diagrams, allowing for a detailed understanding of the engine&#39;s workflow.</p> <h1>Why Floxy Stays Lightweight</h1> <p>Floxy doesn&#39;t use brokers, RPC, or external daemons. It runs entirely within the application process, relying solely on PostgreSQL and the standard Go and pgx packages:<br/> - pgx - a fast driver and connection pool;<br/> - context - operation lifetime management;<br/> - net/http - REST API via the new ServeMux;<br/> - go:embed - built-in migrations and schemas. Despite the presence of background workers and a scheduler, Floxy remains a library, not a platform, without separate binaries or RPC protocols.</p> <h1>Example of Usage</h1> <p><code>engine := floxy.NewEngine(pgxPool)</code><br/> <code>defer engine.Shutdown()</code></p> <p><code>wf, _ := floxy.NewBuilder(&quot;order&quot;, 1).</code><br/> <code>Step(&quot;reserve_stock&quot;, &quot;stock.Reserve&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Then(&quot;charge_payment&quot;, &quot;payment.Charge&quot;).</code><br/> <code>OnFailure(&quot;refund&quot;, &quot;payment.Refund&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Step(&quot;send_email&quot;, &quot;notifications.Send&quot;).</code><br/> <code>Build()</code></p> <p><code>engine.RegisterWorkflow(ctx, wf)</code></p> <p><code>engine.RegisterHandler(&amp;ReserveStock{})</code><br/> <code>engine.RegisterHandler(&amp;ChargePayment{})</code><br/> <code>engine.RegisterHandler(&amp;RefundPayment{})</code><br/> <code>engine.RegisterHandler(&amp;Notifications{})</code></p> <p><code>workerPool := floxy.NewWorkerPool(engine, 3, 100*time.Millisecond)</code><br/> <code>workerPool.Start(ctx)</code></p> <p><code>instanceID, err := engine.Start(ctx, &quot;order-v1&quot;, input)</code></p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Floxy solves the same problem as large orchestrators, but with the library philosophy inherent to Go: minimal abstractions, maximum control.<br/> It implements the Saga pattern with orchestration, supports compensation, conditions, parallelism, and interactive steps - all while remaining lightweight, transparent, and embeddable.<br/> Floxy is a tool for those who prefer manageability without infrastructure and reliability without redundancy.</p> <p><a href="http://github.com/rom8726/floxy">http://github.com/rom8726/floxy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Such_Humor_9911"> /u/Such_Humor_9911 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogwyfe/floxy_lightweight_saga_workflow_engine_on_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogwyfe/floxy_lightweight_saga_workflow_engine_on_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I recently joined a company, really like the product but the code is real mess. It‚Äôs a huge repo with all services they have. Bunch of go, nodejs, vue3, react, angular 1.. all together. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even a monorepo, just many things in all repo. All services, ui run all together with tmux. </p> <p>An example of some</p> <p>GO part</p> <pre><code>tmux new-session -d -s SOME_SYSTEM \ \; new-window -d -n api -c ./REPO/systems/api &quot;fd -e go --exclude=\&quot;**/wire*.go\&quot; | entr -cr go run . start&quot; \ \; new-window -d -n backend -c ./REPO/systems/backend &quot;fd -e go -e toml --exclude=\&quot;**/wire*.go\&quot; --exclude=\&quot;vendor/**\&quot; | entr -cr go run . -c config.local.toml server&quot; \ </code></pre> <p>Node part </p> <pre><code>\; new-window -d -n iu -c ./REPO/services/iu &#39;node --inspect=9233 --watch bin/master.js&#39; \ </code></pre> <p>As you see in node services I can add --inspect=9233 and do some debugging with chrome//inspect </p> <p>But I cannot find a way to debug go services, I wish i could connect somehow with goland to go process. </p> <p>Other team members printing to logs to understand what happens in code </p> <p>I cannot remove some service from tmux and run it standalone and debug, the tmux flow adds all the envs, cors, caddy shit. I tried to run it standalone, but after all it gave me CORS, adding cors to service itself didn&#39;t help because of caddy.. </p> <p>So is there anyway to attach debugger to the go process?</p> <p>Thx</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/w32unix"> /u/w32unix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogo3uq/debugging_process_running_with_tmux_along_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogo3uq/debugging_process_running_with_tmux_along_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>
