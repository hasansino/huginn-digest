            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know this is a little off topic but this is definitively the sub I want to ask. It&#39;s directed at those of you who have used Python. I really connect with Go&#39;s error handling. Just treat the error as a value and deal with it accordingly with traditional control flow statements. And I love that it uses the NASA approach of nesting errors so that your final report of a programme-breaking issue through all the functions it&#39;s been passed through could look something like this: </p> <p>NASA: mission failed: take off halted: insufficient fuel: fuel pressure guage faulty: stuck valve</p> <p>Go Software: program failed: cant reach server: response not given: network handshake incomplete: no returned Ack: packets not sent: OS networking unit file invalid</p> <p>Not only do I like that approach, I also like the culture of errors. I&#39;m almost always expecting to get back an error. Sure, checking for nil is minutely inconvenient but it&#39;s worth it.</p> <p>Anyyyyyyway... I don&#39;t connect with Python. Am I right in thinking that throwing exceptions is correct? That feels off and... frankly... bad code? I feel like if I rely on doing a try except on indexing into a structure then I haven&#39;t prepped properly to do that check. </p> <p>Keep in mind I know and love python. I&#39;ve used it before Go. But I still come here to get people&#39;s opinions because I just feel lazy grabbing exceptions like candy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HighOptical"> /u/HighOptical </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lawzjn/can_i_please_ask_a_question_about_handling_errors/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lawzjn/can_i_please_ask_a_question_about_handling_errors/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m following a tutorial online, this one to be specific <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VLmLOiQ3ck&amp;t=2762s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VLmLOiQ3ck&amp;t=2762s</a> and the problem is he is using MySQL, I&#39;m using MSSQL, I already asked for help about it because there aren&#39;t any tutorials I found about creating an API in go for MSSQL. Anyway I got replies that it&#39;s not that different, just a different driver. What I seem to be lost at is I have no clue what I&#39;m doing, in the sense of, I&#39;ve done 50 mins of the tutorial and I haven&#39;t been able to create anything in my database. Like create a new user. Maybe I&#39;m getting there but I seem to struggle with libraries and frameworks, I don&#39;t really care about the syntax of go, I mean I know other languages so it&#39;s similar but the problem is using frameworks and libraries. I heard that go is powerful enough to not need frameworks. I guess a driver is a library in a way? </p> <p>Okay the way to maybe clear things out, the way I understand API&#39;s is it&#39;s a middleman between the database and the front-end (website). An analogy I would give is if you were at the bar, the waiter/bartender would be the front-end/access point, you tell the bartender what you want and he goes to the cook in the back and tells him and order, the cook is the API, he works between the bartender and the supply/warehouse for the food and drinks he has to create. And the warehouse is in a way the database. I don&#39;t know if this is an okay analogy but what is my first step when trying to make one in go. Do I look into drivers for MSSQL and choose one and look at the documentation, can I find out in the documentation how to connect to the database and create a new User for example? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aphroditelady13V"> /u/aphroditelady13V </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lamcct/how_do_you_learn_to_make_a_crud_api/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lamcct/how_do_you_learn_to_make_a_crud_api/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Everyone!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/magicbell/mason">Mason</a> is a small, JSON schema-backed framework to build API handlers in Go. High level design goals:</p> <ul> <li><strong>JSON schema first</strong> - The Input/Output models are described by JSON schema and an example. By implementing the <code>model.Entity</code> interface, the model definition is tested against the schema so they are never out of sync. Some other approaches to this problem lean on struct tags, but we prefer a handwritten schema as the source of truth.</li> <li><strong>Incremental adoption</strong> - we wanted Mason to be small, and easy to add to an existing project. You do this by implementing the <code>mason.Runtime</code> that can <code>Handle</code> the <code>Operation</code> created by Mason, and <code>Respond</code> to a HTTP request. The same goes for handling errorr. The example in the README recommends an approach and it&#39;s easy to roll out your own.</li> <li><strong>OpenAPI 3.1 generation</strong> - As someone commented last week on this sub, OpenAPI 3.1 has been around for a few years now and using it future-proofs the spec. Schemas can be composed (Mason maintains a registry) and you can dereference any one-off schemas on demand.</li> <li><strong>Support Resource grouping &amp; querying</strong> - REST API resources and endpoints are a map to an API/product&#39;s feature offerings. For example <code>/integrations/slack</code>, and <code>/integrations/web_push</code> are two different resources, but to get all <code>integration</code> resources, the integration <code>RouteGroup</code>, a construct in Mason comes in handy.</li> </ul> <p>The code is MIT licensed, and available on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/magicbell/mason">https://github.com/magicbell/mason</a></p> <p>I&#39;ve been a long-time lurker on this sub, and I hope I can get some feedback (both on the code &amp; approach), ideas and may be, even usage from you!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, my name is Juan, I&#39;ve been working in the software industry since 2021. I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That‚Äôs where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles. </p> <p>I always wanted to learn or work with Go, but I never really had the chance to jump into any project that used it. In 2023, after a couple of years prepping for AWS certifications, between all the cert studying and job hopping, I burned out a couple of times. </p> <p>At some point, I just realized I didn‚Äôt want my career to be like that. With all the noise around AI and the constant talk of jobs being replaced, I found myself wanting to step away from the rat race. I decided to start focusing more on working with projects I actually care about. </p> <p>I‚Äôm deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through <a href="https://localbitcoins.net/">localbitcoins.net</a> in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend <a href="https://whycryptocurrencies.com/">https://whycryptocurrencies.com/</a>, really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.</p> <p>Until I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn‚Äôt really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I‚Äôm not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications. </p> <p>Investigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry. I&#39;ve been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL). At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I‚Äôve stuck with the longest. </p> <p>Until now, I‚Äôve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I‚Äôve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing. </p> <p>Here‚Äôs the repo: <a href="https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet">https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet</a>, and here is a video with a basic <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4">demo</a>. </p> <p>It‚Äôs still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I‚Äôve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I‚Äôve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens. </p> <p>I‚Äôve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/juampi_b"> /u/juampi_b </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lag77n/wails_hd_wallet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lag77n/wails_hd_wallet/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The official emscripten docs suggests using emcc to preload the directory into their virtual FS. What is the analog to that for rust? </p> <p>Edit: truly amazing that this doesn&#39;t have an answer yet. I guess emscripten in rust is dead or something? I was hoping to rewrite a game framework in rust. The framework currently supports Mac, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. I wanted the rewrite to introduce web support. The framework uses lua as a scripting language. MLua can currently only target emscripten not wasm32-unknown-unknown or wasm32-wasip1. Maybe I could try to get MLua to work without emscripten. It seems like the newest wisi sdk should support exception handling for libc or whatever it&#39;s called. </p> <p>It&#39;s amazing that bevy can actually target web without emscripten.

We express invariants in types. Async is just another invariant. It&#39;s not early optimization, it&#39;s simply spending time on properly describing the problem space.</p> <p>Tokio is also 9/10; now that it has ostensibly won the executor wars, wish people would be less fearful in depending directly on it. If you want to be executor agnostic, realize that the usecase is relatively limited. We&#39;ll probably see some change in this space around io-uring, but I&#39;m thinking Tokio will also become the dominant runtime here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kaiserkarel"> /u/kaiserkarel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lagmig/hot_take_tokio_and_asyncawait_are_great/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lagmig/hot_take_tokio_and_asyncawait_are_great/">[comments]</a></span></div>
