            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I know just about enough Go to be dangerous and I&#39;d like to use it for a project I&#39;m working on which is heavily network-orientated.</p> <p>I want to write some software to interact with some existing software, which is very very proprietary but uses a well-defined and public standard. So, things like &quot;just use libp2p&quot; are kind of out - I know what I want to send and receive.</p> <p>You can think of these nodes as like a mesh network. They&#39;ll sit with a predefined list of other nodes, and listen. Another node might connect to them and pass some commands, expecting a response back even if it&#39;s just a simple ACK message. Something might happen, like a switch might close that triggers a GPIO pin, and that might cause a node to connect to another one, pass that message, wait for a response, and then shut up again. Nodes might also route traffic to other nodes, so you might pass your message to a node that only handles routing traffic, who will then figure out who you mean and pass it on. Each node is expected to have more than one connection, possibly over different physical links, so think in terms of &quot;port 1 sends traffic over 192.168.1.200:5000 and port 2 sends traffic over 192.168.2.35:5333&quot;, with one maybe being a physical chunk of cable and the other being a wifi bridge, or whatever - that part isn&#39;t super important.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve come up with so far is that each node &quot;connector&quot; will open a socket with net.Listen() then fire off a goroutine that just loops over and over Accept()ing from that Listen()er, and spawning another goroutine to handle that incoming request. Within that Accept()er if the message is just an ACK or a PING it&#39;ll respond to it without bothering anyone else, because the protocol requires a certain amount of mindless chatter to keep the link awake.</p> <p>I can pass the incoming messages to the &quot;dispatcher&quot; using a simple pubsub-type setup using channels, and this works pretty well. A &quot;connector&quot; will register itself with the pubsub broker as a destination, and will publish messages to the &quot;dispatcher&quot; which can interpret and act upon them - send a reply, print a message, whatever.</p> <p>What I&#39;m stuck on is, how do I handle the case where I need to connect out to a node I haven&#39;t yet contacted? I figured what I&#39;d do is make a map of net.Conn keyed with the address to send to - if I want to start a new connection out then if the net.Conn isn&#39;t in the map then add it, and start the request handler to wait for the reply, and then send the message.</p> <p>Does this seem a reasonable way to go about it, or is there something really obvious I&#39;ve missed - or worse, is this likely to be a reliability or security nightmare?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/erroneousbosh"> /u/erroneousbosh </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1n9guqn/design_for_a_peertopeer_node_network_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1n9guqn/design_for_a_peertopeer_node_network_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Then you are almost at handling everything in bash, and all the yaml-values being interpolated inside the bash. </p> <p>Then you basically have Nix, but with worse language ergonomics (although it will still be Yaml, so maybe it&#39;s worth it).</p> </blockquote> <p>I guess there&#39;s some right points, YAML isn&#39;t good at everything, while it&#39;s simple Zoi needs grow larger and YAML become isn&#39;t good enough.</p> <p>So I will change the format into a Lua-based package format, so the new package format (<code>name.pkg.lua</code>) will become richer and much more customizable, but this brings new problems.</p> <p>First, I&#39;ve made in a small time a search and a package viewer format for Zoi packages.</p> <p><a href="https://nel.zillowe.qzz.io">Website</a> - <a href="https://gitlab.com/Zillowe/Zillwen/Zusty/Nel">Repo</a></p> <p>And the problem is YAML is a static format, WYSIWYG, and Lua isn&#39;t, I want to make the Lua format as much flexible and customizable as it can thus can be much simpler since the syntax is simple and a lot of people had experience with it (customizing neovim, etc).</p> <p>And therefore with the dramatic change of the format it brings new challenges, such as a new website, a package index, etc.</p> <p>And second this is, I&#39;ll add a build system, this build system contains of these commands:</p> <p>``` $ zoi package meta ./path/to/name.pkg.lua</p> <h1>This command will generate a name.pkg.json metadata that contains all of the final static metadata (crucial for the package index)</h1> <h1>(may require internet)</h1> <p>$ zoi package build ./path/to/name.pkg.json</p> <h1>This command will package that package into a name-os-arch.pkg.tar.zst archive</h1> <h1>This process will downloads and verify the binaries (or compressed binaries) or build the package from source</h1> <h1>This command will collect the final binaries, metadata and the Lua format into that archive</h1> <h1>By default this command will only build the archive for your platform if available, or you could specify the platform with flags or choose --all-platforms instead</h1> <h1>(may require internet)</h1> <p>$ zoi package install ./path/to/name-os-arch.pkg.tar.zst</p> <h1>This command will install the package archive</h1> <h1>(doesn&#39;t require internet)</h1> <p>```</p> <p>Also there&#39;s I&#39;m gonna do a major refactor of all the project, and a better library API for Zoi (if you didn&#39;t know yet, you can implement Zoi into your own Rust applications)</p> <p>This is a huge and exciting undertaking, and I can&#39;t do it alone. I&#39;m looking for collaborators who are interested in package management, build systems, or just want to contribute to a cool open-source Rust project.</p> <p>I need help in several areas, and I&#39;ve broken down the work into manageable tasks. Even if you&#39;re new to Rust, there are ways to get involved!</p> <p>You can test and write documentation for Zoi.</p> <p>Or if you want to write code you can check the <a href="https://github.com/Zillowe/Zoi/blob/main/ROADMAP.md">ROADMAP.md</a>, it has all the features and improvements I want or working on implementing.</p> <p>Please check out the project, and if you&#39;re interested, feel free to join my <a href="https://discord.gg/P4R7yaA3hf">Discord server</a>!</p> <p>This post is just for asking for help building this with me if you&#39;re interested.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the first time, I have a project coming up which will include writing some new logic in rust, and then calling into some older (rather complex) logic written in C. Essentially, we have a very old &quot;engine&quot; written in C which drives forward and manages business logic. We are working toward replacing the entire project in rust, and the code which is most in need of updating is the &quot;engine&quot;. Due to the architecture of the project, it should be fairly straightforward to write a replacement engine in rust and then call into the business logic to run self-contained.</p> <p>There are many sticking points I can see with this plan, but among the first to be solved is how to set the project up to build.</p> <p>In the C world, I&#39;m used to writing and using Makefiles. For rust, I&#39;m used to cargo. I vaguely remember reading that large companies that do multi-language projects including rust tend to ditch cargo and use some other build system, of which I do not remember the details. However, the ease of tooling is one of the reasons we&#39;ve picked rust, and I&#39;d rather not ditch cargo unless necessary. I know worst case I could just set up `make` for the c portion as normal, and then have a target which calls cargo for the rust portions, but it feels like there should be a better way than that.</p> <p>Can anyone offer some wisdom about how best to set up a multi-language project like this to build? Links to articles / resources are appreciated just as much as opinions and anecdotes. I&#39;ve got a lot to learn on this particular subject and want to make sure the foundation of the project is solid.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a-von-neumann-probe"> /u/a-von-neumann-probe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n98szr/how_do_you_manage_crosslanguage_dependencies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n98szr/how_do_you_manage_crosslanguage_dependencies/">[comments]</a></span></div>
