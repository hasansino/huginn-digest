            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Rust community!</p> <p>This is an update to lf-shardedringbuf crate I posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lt3vyg/lfshardedringbuf_an_async_lockfree_sharded_ring/">here</a> (now moved to sharded_ringbuf crate due to misnomer in the name of being &quot;lock-free&quot; and badly incremented version changes).</p> <p>For context, this is essentially a ring buffer of bounded ring buffers made specifically to run with Tokio async runtime (due to needing task local variables). The user can specify a capacity and the number of ring buffers (aka &quot;shards&quot;) they want with each ring buffer occupying up to requested capacity / # of shards. It uses Tokio&#39;s task local variables primarily to know what shard that an enqueuer or dequeuer task should acquire and perform its operation on. It&#39;s somewhat of a scheduler-based approach to assigning/putting a thread-task pair to a shard, context switching the task the thread is working on if it couldn&#39;t find a shard to enqueue/dequeue on. </p> <p>The goal of this buffer is to optimize on the MPMC scenario, so that threads are able to push onto and pop from separate shards in a nonblocking manner.</p> <p>So what&#39;s changed/added?</p> <ul> <li>Lots of documentation added to this crate. You should be able to view them on this <a href="https://docs.rs/sharded_ringbuf/0.1.0/sharded_ringbuf/">docs</a> page.</li> <li>Added several test cases (though not exhaustive) to check if the buffer is performing correctly underneath a Tokio async single-threaded or multi-threaded environment among the different shard acquisition policy supported.</li> <li>Made several different spawning functions specifically for the purpose of enqueuing and dequeuing items onto the buffer (previous spawning function kinda let the user have freedom on what they should spawn, which allowed for misuse of the function).</li> <li>There is a couple new policies (&quot;Pin&quot; and &quot;CFT&quot;), which may be beneficial if the user is spawning a static or dynamic number of enqueuer/dequeuer tasks.</li> </ul> <p>There&#39;s still a lot of functions I have to tests (like all the async functions, and clone ones) as well as have good benchmarking cases and plots (there&#39;s already some benchmarking code in the benches folder, but I have yet to consolidate the results from them). I am open to any feedback and would appreciate any contribution or support on this project.</p> <p>Links to repo/crates.io below:</p> <ul> <li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/asder8215/sharded_ringbuf/tree/master">https://github.com/asder8215/sharded_ringbuf/tree/master</a></li> <li>Crates.io: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sharded%5C_ringbuf">https://crates.io/crates/sharded\_ringbuf</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asder8215"> /u/asder8215 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mnv4r0/sharded_ringbuf_v012/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mnv4r0/sharded_ringbuf_v012/">[comments]</a></span></div>

For now my priority is just to get a very basic application to even work.</p> <p>I&#39;m writing a fairly basic web application using Actix Web, and taking lots of help from <em>ahem</em>, AI (sorry!). I&#39;m basically following the same patterns (configure routes, write handlers, etc.) as I did when I was working with web frameworks in Python. So far everything&#39;s working like I&#39;d expect, and I&#39;m kind of amazed it hasn&#39;t ever crashed. If I had worked with C/C++ with my half-baked knowledge then I would&#39;ve needed to get past so many crashes just to even get even a portion of it to work, so this is very promising and incredibly satisfying to see my program work on my very first attempt and I feeling very enthusiastic about attempting to write a slightly more complex application (Reactive frontend with WebSocket, nicely integrated together with my Rust backend).</p> <p>I&#39;m not so sure about how to organize code, but so far I have a main.rs for the main launcher and cli arguments, server.rs for the http listener, a routes.rs that configures the http endpoints, web.rs that contains the handlers for these routes. It looks kind of right to me but I&#39;m too new to all this to have some intuition about code-smells. For example, I have a web.rs but I am not sure if that filename is okay or I&#39;ll end up confusing functions in that with what is already there in actix-web.</p> <p>More abstractly, I was wondering what are some common mistakes, pitfalls, anti-patterns, code-smells, etc. that someone like me at this early stage should watch out for? How do I even know whether what I&#39;m writing is idiomatic style, or do I just need to wait until I reach that stage?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>SlateDB (See <a href="https://slatedb.io/">https://slatedb.io/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb">https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb</a>) allows you to use object storage such as S3 (or Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) in a way that&#39;s a lot more like a traditional block device.</p> <p>I saw another person created a project they called &quot;ZeroFS&quot;. It turns out that it uses SlateDB under the hood to provide a file abstraction. There&#39;s lots of good ideas in there, such as automatically encrypting and compressing data, however, the fundamental idea is to build a POSIX compatible file API on top of SlateDB and then create a block storage abstraction of the file API. In furtherance of that, there is a lot of code to handle caching and other code paths that don&#39;t directly support the &quot;run ZFS on object storage&quot;</p> <p>I was really curious and wondered: &quot;What if you were to just directly map blocks to object storage using SlateDB and then let ZFS handle all of the details of compression, caching, and other gnarly details?&quot;</p> <p>The results are significantly better performance numbers with _less_ caching. I was still getting more than twice the throughput on some tests designed to emulate real world usage. The internal WAL and read caches for SlateDB can even be disabled, with no measurable performance hit.</p> <p>My project is here: <a href="https://github.com/john-parton/slatedb-nbd">https://github.com/john-parton/slatedb-nbd</a></p> <p>I also wanted to be able to share the NBD server that I wrote in a way that could be generically reused, so I made a `tokio-nbd` crate! <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio-nbd">https://crates.io/crates/tokio-nbd</a></p> <p>I would not recommend using this &quot;in production&quot; yet, but I actually feel pretty confident about the overall design. I&#39;ve gone out of my way to make this as thin of an abstraction as possible, and to leave all of the really hard stuff to ZFS and SlateDB. Because you can even disable the WAL and cache for SlateDB, I&#39;m very confident that it should have quite good durability characteristics.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GameCounter"> /u/GameCounter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mn40ym/my_first_real_rust_project_run_zfs_on_object/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mn40ym/my_first_real_rust_project_run_zfs_on_object/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is not a big deal, but I find it hard to come by posts about Go assembly.</p> <p>I did it with the AI. I first prepared a reference with examples, register explanations, and a listing of all available instructions, along with a section explaining how to use instructions not available in Go assembly. With that, AI was able to implement everything (in like 100x tries with many different chats).</p> <p>With the X11/Xvideo example (which doesn&#39;t convert YUV-&gt;RGB but is just doing a direct copy), I don&#39;t even see the process when sorted by CPU; just occasionally, the Xorg process will spike, and with the test video, it is only using 10M.

And the same thing goes for when you just want to use any literal as pointer. </p> <p>Of course this might not have been an issue if we were dealing with small structs with just 1 or 2 optional fields but when we are talking about big structs where most of the values are optional it becomes a real pain if you don&#39;t have something like `ptr`.</p> <p>I understand that a constructor like this could help:</p> <pre><code>func NewFoo(required1 int, required2 string, opts ...FooOption) Foo { ... } </code></pre> <p>But then it always feels a little overcomplicated where essentially only tests would actually use the this constructor (thinking of structs that are essentially DTOs).</p> <p>Please let me know if there&#39;s actually something that I&#39;m missing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/prototyp3PT"> /u/prototyp3PT </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mn766t/just_make_it_a_pointer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mn766t/just_make_it_a_pointer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a type safety, auto completion and compile time-errors enjoyer I‚Äôve been both using code generators and developing couple of my own for a while. Maybe you came across to my posts introducing my work earlier this year. I will skip mentioning them again as I did many times. I also regularly use SQLc and looking for adopting couple others in near future eg. protoc and qlgen. </p> <p>I‚Äôve convinced myself to make a public list of Go tools that is designed to generate type safe code; reduce the use of reflection. I think the discoverability of such tools are painfully difficult because there are too many options with small to medium size adoption with their oddly specific value proposition inherently serve to its author‚Äôs exclusive problems; almost tailored to one codebase‚Äôs needs and marketed only for advantages to the author. </p> <p>Before investing time on a list; I need to make sure there is no comparable prior work before start. </p> <p>The criteria for tools:</p> <ul> <li>By main project goal it replaces the use of reflection code with code generation. </li> <li>Solves a common-enough problem that the author is not the single developer suffers from it. </li> <li>Well maintained and tested.</li> <li>It has a CLI and not exclusively online for build step integration purposes. </li> <li>Robust implementation that doesn‚Äôt ignore edge cases in input. Preferably uses AST operations and not just textual operations.</li> </ul> <p>I ask you for existing work if there is any, critics on criteria; and any suggestion for tool list. Suggestions could be something you‚Äôve published or you use. </p> <p>I also wonder if there would be anyone interested on contributing to the list with PRs and etc. For such direction I would waive my authority on the work and claim no ownership further. </p> <p>Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ufukty"> /u/ufukty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mn6zu9/listing_of_tools_that_replace_the_reflection/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mn6zu9/listing_of_tools_that_replace_the_reflection/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1mnqq5j/progress_of_this_solodevs_rustbuild_mmorpg/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hiya! I‚Äôm building an engine for 2D MMORPGs. My last post was now a month ago and I just wanted to share the latest progress. I think it&#39;s very neat to be building both an Engine and a game all at once, especially one that is online and massively multiplayer.</p> <p>If you want to check it out and provide feedback, the URL is below. It will show either &quot;Player Offline&quot; or &quot;Connect to World&quot; based on if the server is online right now or not. I haven&#39;t kept the world consistently available for online MMO play because I keep making so many updates.</p> <p>Game: <a href="https://rpgfx.com/">https://rpgfx.com/</a></p> <p>No need to make an account or install anything, play right in your browser.</p> <p>The things I&#39;ve learned working on this project are pretty varied.</p> <p><strong>ECS</strong><br/> I know BEVY is famous for being an ECS system, from a <a href="https://github.com/ryankopf/colony">colony sim game I started to work on</a> in Bevy. But I hated the world query system - too many potential errors were being pushed to runtime because of Bevy&#39;s design. That&#39;s one of the leading things that made me think that Bevy was not right for my use case, so I built my own engine.</p> <p>In building my engine though, I started with a very Object Oriented pattern. I come from a Ruby background. So I had Entities, Items, the entities had various things on them like Behaviors, Inventory, etc, stored on those objects themselves. Then I watched a video about &quot;Data Driven Design&quot; in video games and it helped me realize some of the performance issues I had or would be having were related to this pattern.</p> <p>So I started to move towards a hybrid ECS approach. Entities are still distinct objects, not just an EntityID, but components that are going to be frequently accessed can now be iterated through much more quickly.</p> <p><strong>JS/Wasm</strong><br/> I feel like the interop of JavaScript and WASM may have been a slowdown in my project before, but I think the tooling, compilation, and above-all the performance has improved greatly in this area. I was experiencing some problems with browsers deciding to delay my requestAnimationFrame requests because my game loop took too long. I have spent a lot of time optimizing and figuring out why, until one day it all seemed to click nicely. I&#39;m not even sure which change was the big boost, but I&#39;m glad things are better.</p> <p><strong>Where I&#39;m At</strong><br/> Every month or two I feel like &quot;Ah, now I&#39;m done with all the hard parts&quot; and then some more pop up. But it feels a lot more like that now. Once I implement shops and a skill tree, I think all the features will be done enough that my focus will shift from engine features to gameplay experience.</p> <p><strong>What&#39;s Neatest</strong><br/> The game world editor is built into the engine and operates inside the game world. You can see all my tooling for making games, and even make your own game. Just press the &quot;x&quot; key to open the editor.</p> <p>Appreciate any feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ryankopf"> /u/ryankopf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/n2rn8az0pgif1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1mnqq5j/progress_of_this_solodevs_rustbuild_mmorpg/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
