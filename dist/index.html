            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working a lot on my <a href="https://github.com/asder8215/lf-shardedringbuf">lf-shardedringbuf</a> crate, which is an async ring buffer data structure (meant to take advantage of both Tokio&#39;s multithreading + cooperative multitasking capabilities through sharding, task local variables, and a shard acquisition policy), but one thing that I have been wondering about on how to test is whether my async functions are cancel safe.</p> <p>For example, I have both a synchronous clear method and an asynchronous clear method for my data structure, which the asynchronous clear method looks as follow:</p> <pre><code> pub async fn async_clear(&amp;self) { // Acquire all shards // CANCEL SAFETY: When a future is aborted, it puts false back into the lock let mut guards = Vec::new(); for shard in 0..self.shard_locks.len() { let guard = ShardLockGuard::acquire(&amp;self.shard_locks[shard]).await; guards . push (guard); } // reset each shard&#39;s inner ring buffer for (shard_ind, _guard) in guards .into_iter().enumerate() { let mut drop_index = self.inner_rb[shard_ind] .dequeue_index .load(Ordering::Acquire); let stop_index = self.inner_rb[shard_ind] .enqueue_index .load(Ordering::Acquire); while drop_index != stop_index { // SAFETY: This will only clear out initialized values that have not // been dequeued. unsafe { ptr::drop_in_place( (*self.inner_rb[shard_ind].items[ drop_index ].load(Ordering::Relaxed)) . as_mut_ptr (), ) } drop_index = ( drop_index + 1) % self.inner_rb[shard_ind].items.len(); } self.inner_rb[shard_ind] .enqueue_index .store(0, Ordering::Release); self.inner_rb[shard_ind] .dequeue_index .store(0, Ordering::Release); self.inner_rb[shard_ind] .job_count .store(0, Ordering::Release); } } </code></pre> <p>And for reference, this is how my ring buffer data structure looks like:</p> <pre><code>/// A sharded ring (circular) buffer struct that can only be used in an *async environment*. #[derive(Debug)] pub struct LFShardedRingBuf&lt;T&gt; { capacity: AtomicUsize, // Used to determine which shard a thread-task pair should work on // CachePadded to prevent false sharing shard_locks: Box&lt;[CachePadded&lt;AtomicBool&gt;]&gt;, // Multiple InnerRingBuffer structure based on num of shards // CachePadded to prevent false sharing inner_rb: Box&lt;[CachePadded&lt;InnerRingBuffer&lt;T&gt;&gt;]&gt;, poisoned: AtomicBool, } // An inner ring buffer to contain the items, enqueue and dequeue index, and job counts for LFShardedRingBuf struct #[derive(Debug, Default)] struct InnerRingBuffer&lt;T&gt; { items: Box&lt;[AtomicPtr&lt;MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;&gt;]&gt;, enqueue_index: AtomicUsize, dequeue_index: AtomicUsize, job_count: AtomicUsize, } </code></pre> <p>The cancel safety issue here comes from a task aborting in one of the awaits to locking my shards, which means that some shards could be locked without it being released. To fix this issue, I made a ShardLockGuard that releases the lock to the shard it acquired when it gets dropped, so in theory, a cancelled task should not cause issue with this function. However, I also want to create test cases to prove that this function is indeed cancel safe. The expected behavior for a cancelled task performing an async_clear is that the buffer is not cleared or changed from its previous state. </p> <p>How do you go about cancelling Tokio tasks in test cases?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asder8215"> /u/asder8215 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxoou2/how_do_you_test_if_an_async_function_is_cancel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxoou2/how_do_you_test_if_an_async_function_is_cancel/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I‚Äôve been working with Rust daily for a while now and I‚Äôve kind of grown tired of the way I currently manage build targets, optional deps/features, and the like. I wanted to share my current outline and see if someone could help me improve it, or just teach me alternative ways.</p> <p>I have a monorepo where my workspace Cargo.toml is obviously root-level. I define shared deps here, as is the norm. All of my crates/* and services/* use workspace deps. </p> <p>Obviously, I have a root-level .cargo/config.toml where I define my build targets. I use ‚Äúcpu=native‚Äù without any extra features because I know the deployment architecture in all scenarios. </p> <p>I have clear profiles in my Cargo.toml for dev/prod/benching. </p> <p>My issue is optional deps and features scattered across crates. I want to clean it up and centralize it. The optional deps are all only used on Linux/prod machines. My test infrastructure and CI infrastructure both run in prod environments using AWS spot instances.</p> <p>I want to have a clear dev target, dev profiles, and dev features. The same in prod.</p> <p>I use multiversion macros for a few functions through the codebase and it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs clean. </p> <p>The annoying shit is using tokio-uring, demikernel, quinn, etc. features all over the place instead of defining them once for production builds and being done. </p> <p>I‚Äôve thought about a dedicated crate to handle this but like‚Ä¶ no. I don‚Äôt want that extra shit in my codebase.</p> <p>Ideas? Suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LoadingALIAS"> /u/LoadingALIAS </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxm4qr/centralizing_features_targets/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxm4qr/centralizing_features_targets/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m diving into the backend development world and have a few questions, particularly concerning Rust, and also about language choices in general. I&#39;m hoping to get some insights from those of you with more experience! 1. Is there a backend framework in Rust that is considered the &quot;best&quot; or most similar to NestJS? I&#39;ve really enjoyed working with NestJS in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem due to its modular architecture, dependency injection, and decorator-based approach. I&#39;m looking for something in Rust that offers a similar level of structure, productivity, and perhaps even an opinionated way of building applications. I&#39;ve heard of Actix-web, Rocket, and Axum, but I&#39;m curious about which one (or perhaps another entirely) aligns most closely with the NestJS philosophy. 2. What&#39;s the best ORM you&#39;ve used in Rust, and why? Data persistence is obviously crucial. I&#39;m looking for recommendations on robust and well-maintained ORMs in Rust. What have your experiences been with different options? What are their pros and cons in terms of ease of use, features, performance, and community support? 3. For backend development, in your opinion, should I learn Rust or Zig? This is a broader question, but I&#39;m at a crossroads. Both Rust and Zig are fascinating low-level languages with strong communities and growing ecosystems. My goal is to build high-performance, reliable backend services. I&#39;m interested in hearing your thoughts on which language might be a better long-term investment for a backend developer, considering factors like: - Learning curve - Ecosystem maturity (libraries, frameworks) - Job market demand - Community support - Suitability for typical backend tasks (APIs, databases, concurrency, etc.) Thanks in advance for your valuable input! I&#39;m excited to learn from your experiences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KWalkerNNK"> /u/KWalkerNNK </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxi3yx/rust_backend_frameworks_orms_nestjs_equivalent/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lxi3yx/rust_backend_frameworks_orms_nestjs_equivalent/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Rust&#39;s design, there seems to be an important rule, that a function&#39;s interface is completely described by its type signature. For example, lifetime bounds, when unstated, are guessed based only on the type signature, rather than by looking through the function&#39;s body.</p> <p>I agree that this is a good rule. If I edit the function&#39;s implementation, I don&#39;t want to mess up its signature.</p> <p>But now consider lifetime variance. When a struct is parameterized by lifetimes, they can be either covariant, contravariant, or invariant. But we don&#39;t annotate which is which. Instead, the variances are inferred from the body of the struct definition.</p> <p>This seems to be a violation of the above philosophy. If I&#39;m editing the body of a struct definition, it&#39;s easy to mess up the variances in its signature.</p> <p>Why?

Concerns about hiring and learning curve.</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>We&#39;re a startup considering adopting Rust for our backend development, but we have some concerns and would love to hear from those who have experience with Rust in a similar context. Our focus is on rapid prototyping, solid regression testing, and building distributed systems using AWS services like SQS, SNS, S3, along with integrations for AI and video streaming. We have experience with GoLang, where we could hire good developers from other languages and have them performing well within 2 weeks. We&#39;re worried about the learning curve for new hires with Rust and how it might affect our hiring process.</p> <p>Here are our main questions:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> How does Rust fare in terms of rapid prototyping? We need to iterate quickly, and while we understand Rust&#39;s strong type system and compile-time checks can prevent bugs, we&#39;re concerned about the initial development speed compared to languages like Go or Python.</li> <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> We rely heavily on regression tests to maintain code quality. How does Rust&#39;s testing framework hold up for complex systems? Is it easy to write and maintain tests for distributed systems?</li> <li><strong>Distributed Systems and Integrations:</strong> We&#39;re building distributed systems with AWS (SQS, SNS, S3) and need to integrate with AI services and video streaming. Does Rust have good support for these? Are there any performance benefits or drawbacks we should be aware of?</li> <li><strong>Hiring and Learning Curve:</strong> This is our biggest concern. In GoLang, we could hire talented developers from other backgrounds (e.g., Java, Python) and have them productive in about 2 weeks. With Rust, we&#39;re worried about the steeper learning curve due to concepts like ownership and borrowing. For those who have hired Rust developers: <ul> <li>How long does it typically take for a good developer with no Rust experience to become productive?</li> <li>How is the hiring pool for Rust? Is it harder to find candidates?</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Comparison with GoLang:</strong> We&#39;ve had success with GoLang in terms of simplicity and quick onboarding. For those who have experience with both, how does Rust compare in a startup environment where speed and agility are crucial? Is the performance and safety worth the potential slowdown in development and hiring?</li> </ol> <p>We&#39;d appreciate any insights, especially from those who have used Rust in a startup or fast-paced environment.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>!</p> <p>I know what you&#39;re thinking - &quot;another DI framework? just use interfaces!&quot; And you&#39;re not wrong. I&#39;ve been writing Go for 6+ years and I used to be firmly in the &quot;DI frameworks are a code smell&quot; camp.</p> <p>But after working on several large Go codebases (50k+ LOC), I kept running into the same problems:</p> <ul> <li><code>main.go</code> files that had tons of manual dependency wiring</li> <li>Having to update 20 places when adding a constructor parameter</li> <li>No clean way to scope resources per HTTP request</li> <li>Testing required massive setup boilerplate</li> <li>Manual cleanup with tons of defer statements</li> </ul> <p>So I built <strong>godi</strong> - not because Go needs a DI framework, but because I needed a better way to manage complexity at scale while still writing idiomatic Go.</p> <h1>What makes godi different from typical DI madness?</h1> <p><strong>1. It&#39;s just functions and interfaces</strong></p> <pre><code>// Your code stays exactly the same - no tags, no reflection magic func NewUserService(repo UserRepository, logger Logger) *UserService { return &amp;UserService{repo: repo, logger: logger} } // godi just calls your constructor services.AddScoped(NewUserService) </code></pre> <p><strong>2. Solves the actual request scoping problem</strong></p> <pre><code>// Ever tried sharing a DB transaction across services in a request? func HandleRequest(provider godi.ServiceProvider) http.HandlerFunc { return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { scope := provider.CreateScope(r.Context()) defer scope.Close() // All services in this request share the same transaction service, _ := godi.Resolve[*OrderService](scope.ServiceProvider()) service.CreateOrder(order) // Uses same tx as UserService } } </code></pre> <p><strong>3. Your main.go becomes readable again</strong></p> <pre><code>// Before: 500 lines of manual wiring // After: declare what you have services.AddSingleton(NewLogger) services.AddSingleton(NewDatabase) services.AddScoped(NewTransaction) services.AddScoped(NewUserRepository) services.AddScoped(NewOrderService) provider, _ := services.BuildServiceProvider() defer provider.Close() // Everything cleaned up properly </code></pre> <h1>The philosophy</h1> <p>I&#39;m not trying to turn Go into Java or C#. The goal is to:</p> <ul> <li>Keep your constructors pure functions</li> <li>Use interfaces everywhere (as you already do)</li> <li>Make the dependency graph explicit and testable</li> <li>Solve real problems like request scoping and cleanup</li> <li>Stay out of your way - no annotations, no code generation</li> </ul> <h1>Real talk</h1> <p>Yes, you can absolutely wire everything manually. Yes, interfaces and good design can solve most problems. But at a certain scale, the boilerplate becomes a maintenance burden.</p> <p>godi is for when your manual DI starts hurting productivity. It&#39;s not about making Go &quot;enterprise&quot; - it&#39;s about making large Go codebases manageable.</p> <h1>Early days</h1> <p>I just released this and would love feedback from the community! I&#39;ve been dogfooding it on a personal project and it&#39;s been working well, but I know there&#39;s always room for improvement.</p> <p><strong>GitHub</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/junioryono/godi">github.com/junioryono/godi</a></p> <p>If you&#39;ve faced similar challenges with large Go codebases, I&#39;d especially appreciate your thoughts on:</p> <ul> <li>The API design - does it feel Go-like?</li> <li>Missing features that would make this actually useful for you</li> <li>Performance concerns or gotchas I should watch out for</li> <li>Alternative approaches you&#39;ve used successfully</li> </ul> <p>How do you currently manage complex dependency graphs in large Go projects?

The world is tile-based and infinite in size, with entities, behaviors, combat, items, and more. There‚Äôs a ton left to do before it‚Äôs anywhere near ready, but I wanted to share a screenshot showing what it looks like from the perspective of a level designer / world builder.</p> <p>I come from old-school MUD days, and I think making world-building as easy as possible for ‚ÄúBuilders‚Äù is one of the highest priorities.</p> <p>The part that might surprise you: the game is built to support both full multiplayer <em>and</em> full single-player, whichever you prefer.</p> <p>I posted about this almost a month ago, and since then I‚Äôve been keeping a devlog at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpgfx/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rpgfx/</a> if you want to follow progress. I‚Äôve started adding more animations, attacks, SFX, etc., and it‚Äôs finally starting to feel more alive.</p> <p>Last time I posted, some people were skeptical I could pull off an MMORPG, which is fair. But what I didn‚Äôt mention is that I actually started this project nearly 10 years ago. The first version took 11 months and was written in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.</p> <p>Performance, especially multiplayer, quickly became a limiting factor. So after leveling up a bit, I decided to rewrite the whole thing in Rust about 15 months ago. A lot of my design decisions were clearer the second time around thanks to that first attempt.</p> <p>The biggest win by far has been Rust‚Äôs type system. It let me refactor everything into <code>game_core</code>, <code>game_server</code>, and <code>game_client</code> crates, enabling the dual online/offline modes. Honestly, 99% of the time has gone into solving those architectural problems‚Äîbut they‚Äôre finally solved.</p> <p>Notable improvements since last post:</p> <ul> <li>Leveling system + experience bar</li> <li>Three types of attacks (fireball, sword slash, lightning bolt)</li> <li>Social cues like little star icons to show where other players are in the world</li> </ul> <p>If you want to try it out: <a href="https://rpgfx.com/">https://rpgfx.com/</a><br/> If ‚Äúconnect to server‚Äù fails, I‚Äôm either working on something or it crashed‚Äîjust refresh and click ‚Äúplay offline‚Äù instead.<br/> Press <code>x</code> to open the editor.</p> <p>It‚Äôs still got a long road ahead before it‚Äôs truly fun, but I hope you like what‚Äôs there so far. Eventually, I want users to be able to export their games as <code>.exe</code> files or host them on their own sites.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ryankopf"> /u/ryankopf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/ubck804wf7cf1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1lx1ovc/rewrite_it_in_rust_my_online_mmorpg_creator/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
