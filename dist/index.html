A lot of the functions are big, several 100 lines at a time and I feel that if I am to maintain and extend the code then I&#39;ll need to do some refactoring. I don&#39;t intend to refactor everything from the get-go but to work on each area as necessary i.e. write tests, refactor, and then extend. </p> <p>When it comes to refactoring how do you about breaking down functions so that the original function is still accessible but the extracted functions are not? I&#39;ve not seen a private keyword of any form but I did see that starting a function with a lower case character does something similar but only within a package. Is that correct? Is it normal to have many packages in order to refactor like this? Am I missing a trick, I understand there is a lot I don&#39;t know so any guidance appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DespoticLlama"> /u/DespoticLlama </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogb1l7/refactoring_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ogb1l7/refactoring_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all! I&#39;m using Gorm V2 `gorm.io/gorm`, so there&#39;s some incompatibility with other projects I&#39;ve seen.</p> <p>I&#39;m working on building a media server, and one of sticky points I&#39;m running into is easily handling favorites and ratings on artists, albums and tracks. I&#39;ve got a hack I&#39;m not entirely happy with that uses manual joins, but it breaks down when pulling the favorited values into tracks from an album query.</p> <p>The answer may be in how I&#39;m structuring the database/accessing the data with GORM, etc. But I&#39;m thinking this has to be a solved problem: Table 1 has a single row from Table 2 for each user who logs in.</p> <p>Given these models (incomplete w/r/t the foreign keys)</p> <pre><code>type UserModel struct { ID int64 `gorm:&quot;unique;primaryKey;autoIncrement&quot;` } type AlbumModel struct { ID int64 `gorm:&quot;unique;primaryKey;autoIncrement&quot;` Name string Tracks []*Track Star *AlbumStar `gorm:&quot;foreignKey:ID;references:AlbumID&quot;` } type AlbumStar struct { ID int64 `gorm:&quot;unique;primaryKey;autoIncrement&quot;` UserID int64 // to be filtered in preload AlbumID int64 } type TrackModel struct { ID int64 `gorm:&quot;unique;primaryKey;autoIncrement&quot;` Name string Star *TrackStar `gorm:&quot;foreignKey:ID;references:AlbumID&quot;` } type TrackStar struct { ID int64 `gorm:&quot;unique;primaryKey;autoIncrement&quot;` UserID int64 // to be filtered in preload TrackID int64 } </code></pre> <p>the functionality I would really like to have is below, similar to Gonic&#39;s [preload logic](<a href="https://github.com/sentriz/gonic/blob/75a0918a7ef8bb6c9506de69dd4e6b6e8c35e567/server/ctrlsubsonic/handlers%5C_by%5C_tags.go#L118">https://github.com/sentriz/gonic/blob/75a0918a7ef8bb6c9506de69dd4e6b6e8c35e567/server/ctrlsubsonic/handlers\_by\_tags.go#L118</a>) [TrackStar](<a href="https://github.com/sentriz/gonic/blob/75a0918a7ef8bb6c9506de69dd4e6b6e8c35e567/db/db.go#L453">https://github.com/sentriz/gonic/blob/75a0918a7ef8bb6c9506de69dd4e6b6e8c35e567/db/db.go#L453</a>). </p> <pre><code>func GetAlbum(user_id int64, tx *gorm.DB) *AlbumModel { album := &amp;AlbumModel{} err := tx.Table(&quot;albums&quot;). // error here Preload(&quot;Star&quot;, &quot;user_id = ?&quot;, user_id). Preload(&quot;Tracks&quot;). Preload(&quot;Tracks.Star&quot;, &quot;user_id = ?&quot;, user_id). Find(&amp;album).Error return album } </code></pre> <p>However, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m missing with even the Album&#39;s Star preload above, because gorm errors on creating the database: `failed to parse field: Tracks, error: invalid field found for struct models/dbmodels.Track&#39;s field Star: define a valid foreign key for relations or implement the Valuer/Scanner interface`. Other errors (depending on tags) have been that the Star model doesn&#39;t have a unique index for the album to reference.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried a number of configurations in the gorm/sql tags across all the models, but couldn&#39;t get gorm to migrate the database and create the foreign key between album and star if it uses <a href="http://album.id">album.id</a> and user.id.</p> <p>Hopefully that gives enough examples/context to sort out where the solved problem is so I can use that.</p> <p>Thanks for any help/advice/direction!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy_Manufacturer_6"> /u/Heavy_Manufacturer_6 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1og6v1x/how_to_use_gorm_hasa_with_incomplete_foreign_key/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1og6v1x/how_to_use_gorm_hasa_with_incomplete_foreign_key/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Swed Co. wants to write a version of Ed Co.&#39;s editor that operates in Swedish. Neither company wants the other company to be able to see its code.</p> <p>If it were a C/C++ program, Ed would publish <a href="http://editor.so">editor.so</a> and editor.h, and Swed would build their sweditor.exe using those two files. But in Go, there are no header files. Larger Go programs are built up by sharing the source.</p> <p>What if there were a service called GoCombine? Then our picture has three actors. Ed, Swed, and GoCombine. Ed shares access to its github repo with GoCombine, but not with Swed. Swed shares access to its github repo with GoCombine, but not with Ed. GoCombine builds the two into a Go executable.</p> <p>Has anyone done something like this?

I have 2 questions in the approach, which mostly apply to the repository layer being injected into the service layer. </p> <p>First question regards consumer level interfaces, should I be recreating the same repository interface for the different services that rely on it. I know that the encouraged way for interfaces is to create the interface at the package who needs it but what if multiple packages need the same interface, it seems like repetition to keep defining the same interface. I was thinking to define the interface at the producer level but seems like this is disencouraged.</p> <p>The second question regards composition. So let&#39;s say I have 2 repository interfaces with 3 functions each and only one service layer package requires most of the functions of the 2 repositories. This same service package also has other dependencies on top of that (like I said this is a major refactoring that I&#39;m doing piece by piece). I don&#39;t want to have to many dependencies for this one service package so I was thinking to create an unexported repository struct within the service layer package that is essentially a composition of the repository layer functions I need and inject that into the service.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Rustaceans,<br/> I&#39;m currently following the <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> book using Rust and it has been hugely beneficial. Currently, my tokenizer is a <code>struct Scanner&lt;&#39;a&gt;</code> that produces <code>Token&lt;&#39;a&gt;</code> which has three fields, a token kind enum, a line number, and a <code>lexeme: &amp;&#39;a str</code>. These lifetimes are pretty straightforward, but are obviously following me through the entire system from a token to the scanner to the parser to the compiler and finally to the VM.<br/> When thinking about this a little more, only three tokens actually benefit from the lexemes in the first place: numbers, strings, and identifiers. All the others can be inferred from the kind (a <code>TokenKind::Semicolon</code> will always be represented as <code>&quot;;&quot;</code> in the source code).<br/> If I just attach owned strings to my number, string, and identifier enum variants, I can completely remove the lexeme field, right?<br/> To me the benefit is twofold. The first and obvious improvement: no more lifetimes, which is always nice. But secondly, and this is where I might be wrong, don&#39;t I technically consume less memory this way? If I tokenize the source code and it gets dropped, I would think I use less memory by only storing owned string where they actually benefit me.<br/> Let me know your thoughts. Below is some example code to better demonstrate my ramblings. </p> <p>```rust<br/> // before<br/> enum TokenKind {<br/> Ident,<br/> Equal,<br/> Number,<br/> Semicolon,<br/> Eof,<br/> }<br/> struct Token&lt;&#39;a&gt; {<br/> kind: TokenKind,<br/> lexeme: &amp;&#39;a str,<br/> line: usize,<br/> } </p> <p>// after<br/> enum TokenKind {<br/> Ident(String),<br/> Equal,<br/> Number(String), // or f64 if we don&#39;t care if the user wrote 42 or 42.0<br/> Semicolon,<br/> Eof,<br/> }<br/> struct Token{<br/> kind: TokenKind,<br/> line: usize,<br/> }<br/> ``` edit: code formatting</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lbreede"> /u/lbreede </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1og0m2y/str_vs_string_in_lexical_tokenizer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1og0m2y/str_vs_string_in_lexical_tokenizer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Issue / Current State</h1> <p>Hi, I have been reading a lot of RFC comments about negative-bounds and specialization features in the Rust language, since they would be such a addition to the language.<br/> Both of them are very generic features that can be used in a lot of cases, however (I personally feel like) their most important use case is:</p> <pre><code>impl&lt;T:A&gt; MyTrait for T {/*...*/} //blanket impl impl&lt;T: A+B&gt; MyTrait for T {/*...*/} // if it has B then we can do something better (faster, more cohesive output etc. // or instead just impl&lt;T:C&gt; MyTrait for T{/*...*/} // Even better if C is implemented, abandon the A or A+B case </code></pre> <p>Both of the features could be used to make this a reality, but since they are more complex they have been in an eternal state of limbo since like 2016.<br/> The negative bounds is stopped since suddenly implementing a previously unimplemented trait could lead to a breaking change. But that only happens in a more general case, not in this one.<br/> With specialization it is unintuitive which implementation the compiler uses or it could even be ambiguous. And it could lead to readability issues. But in this case I can tell the compiler what to use where, and it would make the code readable by a new programmer in the codebase!</p> <p><strong>Why not just?</strong></p> <p>I am aware I am not the first to propose this and I would like someone to lead me to a discussion about why this idea was tossed aside.</p> <p>Use a special method to note that in this implementation an &quot;X&quot; case is not allowed, but in that case the trait is implemented somewhere else. So something like: Using &quot;%&quot; as the symbol.</p> <pre><code>impl&lt;T:A + %(B) + %(C) &gt; MyTrait for T {/*...*/} //blanket impl impl&lt;T: A+B + %(C)&gt; MyTrait for T {/*...*/} // if it has B then we can do something better (faster, more cohesive output etc. // or instead just impl&lt;T:C&gt; MyTrait for T{/*...*/} // Even better if C is implemented, abandon the A or A+B case </code></pre> <p>A+ %(B) +%(C) means, that even though next to the required implementation of A, B or C could be implemented, do not allow them. If they are implemented then use a different impl block, since they must exist!<br/> So for example the T:C impl block is deleted, it should create a compiler error, since a required impl block is missing. Makes the code<br/> - readable. That is seeing a single(lower ranked) impl block makes it clear what conditions could lead to a different impl block being used.<br/> - unambiguous (but relatively difficult to implement in the compiler maybe)<br/> - does not make implementing a trait a potentially blocking trait. However, it could lead to unexpected behaviour if a trait implementation does not follow user constraints and therefore changing the MyTrait impl block changes the outcome. But that is the user&#39;s fault.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Reuns85"> /u/Reuns85 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ofvcrt/lang_combination_of_features_negativebounds_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ofvcrt/lang_combination_of_features_negativebounds_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>
