            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>...but it also finally clicked. I just wrapped up about a 20-hour half hungover half extremely well-rested refactoring that leaves me feeling like I need to share my experience.</p> <p>I see people talking about <a href="https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/">sans-io</a> parsers quite frequently but I feel like I&#39;ve never come across a good example of a simple sans-io parser. Something that&#39;s simple enough to understand both the format of <em>what</em> your parsing but also <em>why</em> it&#39;s being parsed the way It is.</p> <p>I think <a href="https://github.com/bearcove/rc-zip/blob/fb8bda07ada8c1a298bfb294330caa7902d93c16/rc-zip/src/fsm/archive.rs">fasterthanlime&#39;s rc-zip</a> is probably the first explicitly labeled sans-io parser I saw in Rust, but zip has some slight weirdness to it that doesn&#39;t necessarily make it (or this parser) dead simple to follow.</p> <p>For context, I write binary format parsers for random formats sometimes -- usually reverse engineered from video games. Usually these are implemented quickly to solve some specific need.</p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve been writing a new parser for a format that&#39;s relatively simple to understand and is essentially just a file container similar to zip.</p> <pre><code>Chunk format: ┌─────────────────────┬────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐ │ 4 byte identifier │ 4 byte data len │ Identifier-specific data... │ └─────────────────────┴────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘ Rough File Overview: ┌───────────────────────┐ │ Header Chunk │ ├───────────────────────│ │ │ │ Additional Chunks │ │ │ │ │ ├───────────────────────│ │ │ │ Data Chunk │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ Casual 1.8GiB │ ┌─▶│ of data │◀─┐ │ │ │ │┌───────────┐ │ │ │ ││ File Meta │ │ │ │ ││has offset │ │ ├───────────────────────┤ ││ into data │ │ │ File Chunk │ ││ chunk │ │ │ │ ││ │ │ ├───────────┬───────────┤ │└───────────┘ │ │ File Meta │ File Meta │──┘ │ ├───────────┼───────────┤ └──│ File Meta │ File Meta │ ├───────────┼───────────┤ │ File Meta │ File Meta │ └───────────┴───────────┘ </code></pre> <p>In the above diagram everything&#39;s a chunk. The <code>File Meta</code> is just me expressing the &quot;FILE&quot; chunk&#39;s identifier-specific data to show how things can get intertwined.</p> <p>On desktop the parsing solution is easy: just <code>mmap()</code> the file and use winnow / nom / byteorder to parse it. Except I want to support both desktop <em>and</em> web (via egui), so I can&#39;t let the OS take the wheel and manage file reads for me.</p> <p>Now I need to support parsing via <code>mmap</code> and whatever the hell I need to do in the browser to avoid loading gigabytes of data into browser memory. The browser method I guess is just doing partial async reads against a <code>File</code> object, and this is where I forced myself to learn sans-io.</p> <p>(Quick sidenote: I don&#39;t write JS and it was surprisingly hard to figure out how to read a subsection of a file from WASM. Everyone seems to just read entire files into memory to keep things simple, which kinda sucked)</p> <p>A couple of requirements I had for myself were to not allow my memory usage during parsing to exceed 64KiB (which I haven&#39;t verified if I go above this, but I do attempt to limit) and the data needs to be accessible <strong>after</strong> initial parsing so that I can file entry data.</p> <p>My initial parser I wrote for the <code>mmap()</code> scenario assumed all data was present, and I ended up rewriting to be sans-io as follows:</p> <h4>Internal State</h4> <p>I created <a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/be278344289990dea3a2e576b281471ea4ee311b/crates/enfusion_pak/src/parser.rs#L215-L220">a parser struct</a> which carries its own state. The states expressed are pretty simple and there&#39;s really only one &quot;tricky&quot; state: when parsing the file entries I know ahead of time that there are an undetermined number of entries.</p> <pre><code>pub struct PakParser { state: PakParserState, chunks: Vec&lt;Chunk&gt;, pak_len: Option&lt;usize&gt;, bytes_parsed: usize, } #[derive(Debug)] enum PakParserState { ParsingChunk, ParsingFileChunk { parsed_root: bool, parents: Vec&lt;Directory&gt;, bytes_processed: usize, chunk_len: usize, }, Done, } </code></pre> <p>There could in theory be literally gigabytes, so I first read the header and then drop into a <code>PakParserState::ParsingFileChunk</code> which parses single entries at a time. This state carries the stateful data specific for parsing this chunk, which is basically a list of processed <code>FileEntry</code> structs up to that point and data to determine end-of-chunk conditions. All other chunks get saved to the <code>PakParser</code> until the file is considered complete.</p> <h4>Parser Stream Changes</h4> <p>I&#39;m using winnow for parsing and they conveniently provide a <a href="https://docs.rs/winnow/latest/winnow/_topic/partial/index.html">Partial</a> stream which can wrap other streams (like a <code>&amp;[u8]</code>). When it cannot fulfill a read given how many tokens are left, it returns an error condition specifying it needs more bytes.</p> <p>The linked documentation actually provides a great example of how to use it with a <code>circular::Buffer</code> to read additional data and satisfy incomplete reads, which is a very basic sans-io example without a custom state machine.</p> <h5>Resetting Failed Reads</h5> <p>Using <code>Partial</code> required some moderately careful thought about how to reset the state of the stream if a read fails. For example if I read a file name&#39;s length and then determine I cannot read that many bytes, I need to pretend as if I never read the name length so I can populate more data and try again.</p> <p>I assume that my parser&#39;s states are the smallest unit of data that I want to read at a time, so to handle I used winnow&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/be278344289990dea3a2e576b281471ea4ee311b/crates/enfusion_pak/src/parser.rs#L282-L293"><code>stream.checkpoint()</code></a> functionality to capture where I was before attempting a parse, then resetting if it fails.</p> <p>Further up the stack <a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/c5e301de4582d8b5295d9fb4a3c93073e858c136/crates/ui/src/pak_wrapper/wasm.rs#L163-L223">I can loop and detect when the parser needs more data</a>. Implicitly, if the parser yields without completing the file that indicates more data is required (there&#39;s also a potential bug here where if the parser tries reading more than my buffer&#39;s capacity it&#39;ll keep requesting more data because the buffer never grows, but ignore that for now).</p> <h5>Offset Quirks</h5> <p>Because I&#39;m now using an incomplete byte stream, any offsets I need to calculate based off the input stream may no longer be <em>absolute</em> offsets. For example, the data chunk format is:</p> <pre><code>id: u32 data_length: u32, data: &amp;[u8] </code></pre> <p>In the <code>mmap()</code> parsing method I could easily just have <code>data</code> represent the real byte range of data, but now I need to express it as a <code>Range&lt;usize&gt;</code> (<code>data_start..data_end</code>) where the range are offsets into the file.</p> <p>This requires me to keep track of how many bytes the parser has parsed and, when appropriate, either tag the chunks with their offsets while keeping the <em>internal data ranges relative to the chunk</em>, or fix up range&#39;s offsets to be absolute. I haven&#39;t really found a generic solution to this that doesn&#39;t involve passing state into the parsers.</p> <h4>Usage</h4> <p>Kind of how fasterthanlime set up <code>rc-zip</code>, I now just have a different user of the parser for each &quot;class&quot; of IO I do.</p> <p>For <code>mmap</code> it&#39;s pretty simple. <a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/c5e301de4582d8b5295d9fb4a3c93073e858c136/crates/enfusion_pak/src/parser.rs#L190">It really doesn&#39;t even need to use the state machine except when the parser is requesting a seek</a>. Otherwise yielding back to the parser without a complete file is probably a bug.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/c5e301de4582d8b5295d9fb4a3c93073e858c136/crates/ui/src/pak_wrapper/wasm.rs#L163-L223">WASM wasn&#39;t too bad either</a>, except for side effects of now using an async API.</p> <p>This is tangential but now that I&#39;m using non-standard IO (i.e. the WASM bridge to JS&#39;s <code>File</code>, <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/struct.File.html"><code>web_sys::File</code></a>) it surfaced some rather annoying behaviors in other libs. e.g. unconditionally using <code>SystemTime</code> or assuming physical filesystem is present. Is this how <code>no_std</code> devs feel?</p> <p><strong>So why did this drive you kind of crazy?</strong></p> <p>Mostly because like most problems none of this is inherently obvious. Except I feel this problem is is generally talked about frequently without the concrete steps and tools that are useful for solving it.</p> <p>FWIW I&#39;ve said this multiple times now, but this approach is modeled similarly to how fasterthanlime did <code>rc-zip</code>, and he even talks about this at a <a href="https://youtu.be/RYHYiXMJdZI?t=802">very high level</a> in his video on the subject.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/landaire/enfusion_tools/blob/be278344289990dea3a2e576b281471ea4ee311b/crates/enfusion_pak/src/parser.rs">The bulk of the parser code is here if anyone&#39;s curious</a>. It&#39;s not very clean. It&#39;s not very good. But it works.</p> <p><em>Thank you for reading my rant.</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anxxa"> /u/anxxa </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kf1d1e/i_finally_wrote_a_sansio_parser_and_it_drove_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kf1d1e/i_finally_wrote_a_sansio_parser_and_it_drove_me/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks, Mods feel free to remove this if it’s not the right category—I wasn’t quite sure where this fits, but I wanted to bring up something I’ve been thinking about.</p> <p>I’ve been a developer for around 5 years, and for the past year or so, I’ve really fallen in love with Rust. Recently I’ve started contributing more publicly—creating libraries, joining Rust-related Discord servers, and just trying to connect with other Rustaceans. It’s been a great experience overall.</p> <p>I’ve worked with a bunch of other languages over the years: JavaScript, C#, C, Java, Python. None of them have felt as enjoyable to write as Rust. And on top of that, Rust gives me the technical safety and control I’ve always wanted. Unless I’m doing heavy DOM work, I basically reach for Rust by default these days.</p> <p>That said, something has been bugging me lately. I’ve noticed in some corners of the internet—forums, subreddits, comment threads—there’s this growing narrative that Rust developers are “cultish” or even politically extreme. Especially since Rust was added to the Linux kernel, there seems to be this weird politicization of the language and community. People throw around terms like “radical leftist” when talking about Rust devs, and honestly… I don’t get it.</p> <p>To be clear, I’m not political myself. I’m just a dev who found a language that feels great to work in and wants to build cool things. Rust solved real problems for me and made systems programming fun again. So where is this narrative coming from?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found myself needing to convert several enums into/from either strings or integers (or both), and could not find a sufficient existing solution. I created a util macro to solve this problem, and scaled it into a properly-tested and fully documented crate: <a href="https://github.com/robofinch/bijective-enum-map">bijective-enum-map</a>.</p> <p>It provides <code>injective_enum_map</code> and <code>bijective_enum_map</code> macros. (In most cases, <code>injective_enum_map</code> is more useful, but the &quot;bi&quot; prefix better captures the two-way nature of both macros.) <code>bijective_enum_map</code> uses <code>From</code> in both directions, while <code>injective_enum_map</code> converts from an enum into some other type with <code>From</code>, and from some other type into an enum with <code>TryFrom</code> (with unit error). </p> <p>It&#39;s probably worth noting that the macros work on non-unit variants as well as the unit variants more common for these purposes.</p> <p>My actual use cases come from encoding the permissible values of various Minecraft Bedrock -related data into more strictly-typed structures, such as:</p> <pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash)] pub enum ChunkVersion { V0, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, V12, V13, V14, V15, V16, V17, V18, V19, V20, V21, V22, V23, V24, V25, V26, V27, V28, V29, V30, V31, V32, V33, V34, V35, V36, V37, V38, V39, V40, V41, } injective_enum_map! { ChunkVersion, u8, V0 &lt;=&gt; 0, V1 &lt;=&gt; 1, V2 &lt;=&gt; 2, V3 &lt;=&gt; 3, V4 &lt;=&gt; 4, V5 &lt;=&gt; 5, V6 &lt;=&gt; 6, V7 &lt;=&gt; 7, V8 &lt;=&gt; 8, V9 &lt;=&gt; 9, V10 &lt;=&gt; 10, V11 &lt;=&gt; 11, V12 &lt;=&gt; 12, V13 &lt;=&gt; 13, V14 &lt;=&gt; 14, V15 &lt;=&gt; 15, V16 &lt;=&gt; 16, V17 &lt;=&gt; 17, V18 &lt;=&gt; 18, V19 &lt;=&gt; 19, V20 &lt;=&gt; 20, V21 &lt;=&gt; 21, V22 &lt;=&gt; 22, V23 &lt;=&gt; 23, V24 &lt;=&gt; 24, V25 &lt;=&gt; 25, V26 &lt;=&gt; 26, V27 &lt;=&gt; 27, V28 &lt;=&gt; 28, V29 &lt;=&gt; 29, V30 &lt;=&gt; 30, V31 &lt;=&gt; 31, V32 &lt;=&gt; 32, V33 &lt;=&gt; 33, V34 &lt;=&gt; 34, V35 &lt;=&gt; 35, V36 &lt;=&gt; 36, V37 &lt;=&gt; 37, V38 &lt;=&gt; 38, V39 &lt;=&gt; 39, V40 &lt;=&gt; 40, V41 &lt;=&gt; 41, } </code></pre> <p>Reducing the lines of code (and potential for typos) felt important. Currently, I don&#39;t use the macro on any enum with more variants than the above (though some have variants with <em>actual</em> names, and at least one requires conversion with either strings or numbers.</p> <p>Additionally, the crate has zero dependencies, works on Rust 1.56, and is <code>no_std</code>. I doubt it&#39;ll ever actually be used in such stringent circumstances with an old compiler and no standard library, but hey, it would work.</p> <p>A feature <em>not</em> included here is const evaluation for these conversions, since const traits aren&#39;t yet stabilized (and I don&#39;t actually use compile-time enum conversions for anything, at least at the moment).

The calculations are numerous and annoying. I would be perfectly fine with the compiler reordering any or all of them for performance reasons.

Has everything needed for proper text parsing including custom POS tagger, anaphora resolution, named entity recognition, auto corrects spelling mistakes, large multi-hierarchical categorization system so you can easily cluster / map groups of similar words, etc.</p> <p>Key benefit is its compact, self contained nature with no external dependencies or API calls, and it&#39;s Rust, so also it&#39;s speed and ability to process ~20,000 words/sec on a single thread. Only needs a single vocabulary data store which is a serialized bincode file for its compact nature -- two data stores compiled, base of 145k words at 77MB, and the full of 914k words at 177MB. Its speed and size are a solid advantage against the self contained Python implementations out there which are multi gigabyte installs and generally process at best a few hundred words/sec.</p> <p>This is a key component in a mucher larger project coined Cicero, which aims to detract from big tech. I was disgusted by how the big tech leaders responded to this whole AI revolution they started, all giddy and falling all over themselves with hopes of capturing even more personal data and attention.., so i figured if we&#39;re doing this whole AI revolution thing, I want a cool AI buddy for myself but offline, self hosted and private.</p> <p>No AGI or that bs hype, but just a reliable and robust text to action pipeline with extensible plugin architecture, along with persistent memory so it custom tailors itself to your personality, while only using a open source LLM to essentially format conversational outputs. Goal here is have a little box that sits in your closet that you maybe even build yourself, and all members of your household connect to it from their multiple devices, and it provides a personalized AI assistant for you. Just helps with the daily mundane digital tasks we all have but none of us want to do -- research and curate data, reach out to a group of people and schedule conference call, create new cloud insnce, configure it and deploy Github repo, place orders on your behalf, collect, filter and organize incoming communication, et al.</p> <p>Everything secure, private and offline, with user data segregated via AES-GCM and DH key exchange using the 25519 curve, etc. End goal is to keep personal data and attention out of big tech&#39;s hands, as I honestly equate the amount of damage social media exploitation has caused to that of lead poisoning during ancient Rome, which many historians belieebelieve was contributing factor to the fall of Rome, as although different, both have caused widespread, systemic cognitive decline.</p> <p>Then if traction is gained a whole private decentralized network... If wanted, you can read essentially manifesto in &quot;Origins and End Goals&quot; post at: <a href="https://cicero.sh/forums/thread/cicero-origins-and-end-goals-000004">https://cicero.sh/forums/thread/cicero-origins-and-end-goals-000004</a></p> <p>Naturally, a quality NLU engine was key component, and somewhat expectedly I guess there ended up being alot more to the project than meets the eye. I found out why there&#39;s only a handful of self contained NLU engines out there, but am quite happy with this.</p> <p>unfortunately, there&#39;s still some issues with the POS tagger due to a noun heavy bias in the data. I need this to be essentially 100% accurate, and confident I can get there. If interested, details of problem resolution and way forward at: <a href="https://cicero.sh/forums/thread/sophia-nlu-engine-v1-0-released-000005#p6">https://cicero.sh/forums/thread/sophia-nlu-engine-v1-0-released-000005#p6</a></p> <p>Along with fixing that, also have one major upgrade planned that will bring contextual awareness to this thing allowing it to differentiate between for example, &quot;visit google.com&quot;, &quot;visit the scool&quot;, &quot;visit my parents&quot;, &quot;visit Mark&#39;s idea&quot;, etc. Will flip that categorization system into a vector based scoring system essentially converting the Webster&#39;s dictionary from textual representations of words into numerical vectors of scores, then upgrade the current hueristics only phrase parser into hybrid model with lots of small yet efficient and accurate custom models for the various language constructs (eg. anaphora resolution, verb / noun clauses, phrase boundary detection, etc.), along with a genetic algorithm and per-word trie structures with novel training run to make it contextually aware. This can be done in short as a few weeks, and once in place, this will be exactly what&#39;s needed for Cicero project to be realized.</p> <p>Free under GPLv3 for individual use, but have no choice but to go typical dual license model for commercial use. Not complaining, because I hate people that do that, but life decided to have some fun with me as it always does. Essentially, weird and unconventionle life, last major phase was years ago and all in short succession within 16 months went suddenly and totally blind, business partner of nine years was murdered via professional hit, forced by immigration to move back to Canada resulting in loss of fiance and dogs of 7 years, among other challenges. </p> <p>After that developed out Apex at <a href="https://apexpl.io/">https://apexpl.io/</a> with aim of modernizing Wordpress eco-system, and although I&#39;ll stand by that project for the high quality engineering it is, it fell flat. So now here I am with Cicero, still fighting, more resilient than ever. Not saying that as poor me, as hate that as much as the next guy, just saying I&#39;m not lazy and incompetent. </p> <p>Currently only have RTX 3050 (4GB vRAM) which isn&#39;t enough to bring this POS tagger up to speed, nor get the contextual awareness upgrade done, or anything else I have. If you&#39;re in need of a world leading NLU engine, or simply believe in Cicero project, please consider grabbing a premium license as it would be greatly appreciated. You&#39;ll get instant access to the binary localhost RPC server, both base and full vocabulary data stores, plus the upcoming contextual awareness upgrade at no additional charge. Price will triple once that upgrade is out, so now is a great time.</p> <p>Listen, I have no idea how the modern world works, as I tapped out long ago. o if I&#39;m coming off as a dickhead for whatever reason, just ignore that. I&#39;m a simple guy, only real goal in life is to get back to Asia where I belong, give my partner a guy, let them know everything will be algiht, then maybe later buy some land, build a self sufficient farm, get some dogs, adopt some kids, and live happily ever after in a peaceful Buddhist village while concentrating on my open source projects. That sounds like a dream life to me.</p> <p>Anyway, sorry for the long message. Would love to hear your feedback on Sophia... I&#39;m quite happy with this iteration, one more upgrade and should be solid for a goto self contained NLU solution that offers amazing speed and accuracy.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;ve always wanted to make a post mortem one day so here goes!</p> <p>I recently graduated with a master’s in software engineering. I’ve been making games as a hobby for about five years, but this was my first commercial release. After shelving a longer 6-month project due to low interest, I decided to try something smaller and faster, a one-month dev cycle as an experiment.</p> <p>Development started on April 1st and the game launched on May 1st. I spent around two weeks building the game (4–6 hours/day), followed by two weeks focused on promotion (2–4 hours/day).</p> <p><strong>Results (3 days post-launch)</strong></p> <p>The game made around $250 net so far, which just about covers what I spent on assets and the Steam page. It got 12 reviews, but a 20% refund rate, likely due to some design missteps I’ll explain below.</p> <p><strong>What Went Well</strong></p> <p>I started by building all the core mechanics with placeholder visuals, then swapped in the art later. That helped keep me focused and prevented scope creep.</p> <p>Setting up the Steam page and pushing a working build early gave me time to fix things ahead of launch. I also contacted a list of Twitch streamers, first with an early build on Itch, then again with Steam keys closer to launch, which led to more launch coverage than I expected.</p> <p>I made daily YouTube Shorts using gameplay and AI voiceovers, which actually helped build up wishlists on what would’ve otherwise been a silent page. TikTok livestreams (both dev and gameplay) were less effective for direct results, but did build a small, supportive community around me, though not necessarily around the game itself.</p> <p>Most importantly, I learned I enjoy shorter projects and can actually ship them, which is huge for me moving forward.</p> <p><strong>What Didn’t Go So Well</strong></p> <p>I made a game in a genre I didn’t fully understand and had no connection to the community around it. That led to negative feedback from the audience I was trying to reach.</p> <p>I also tried to mix horror and comedy, but without a clear tone it just ended up feeling messy. The game is under 2 hours long, and with some unclear design choices, a lot of players got confused or frustrated, leading to that high refund rate.</p> <p>None of my testers were blind, they’d seen gameplay beforehand so their feedback didn’t catch what new players would struggle with. On top of that, the game’s name is long and awkward to say out loud, which made it harder to share or remember.</p> <p>The map ended up being too large for what the game actually offered, and the streamer outreach didn’t land as I hoped, none touched the Itch build, only the Steam version once it launched.</p> <p>Lastly, splitting dev and marketing into clean 2-week blocks wasn’t the best idea. Doing both in parallel might’ve helped generate more momentum while making a better game.</p> <p><strong>Things I’m Unsure About</strong></p> <p>I matched the game’s price to one of the most successful titles in the genre I was targeting. No idea if that helped or hurt.</p> <p>A surprising number of people thought the game was a simulator at first glance, which makes me wonder if I unintentionally hinted at demand for something else entirely.</p> <p>The game got over 10 reviews in the first few days, which is supposedly good for visibility, but I’m not sure yet what the real effect will be.</p> <p><strong>Next Steps &amp; Questions</strong></p> <p>Since launch, I’ve felt kind of stuck. I’m not heartbroken, but I’m not satisfied either, mostly just disappointed I couldn&#39;t make a good game for fans of the genre. Still, I want to keep going.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear from others:</p> <ul> <li>How do you better align your projects with an existing genre/community?</li> <li>Has anyone else tried a one-month development cycle? Is it worth refining or iterating on? What worked for you?</li> </ul> <p>Hope this post is useful to anyone considering a short dev cycle. Open to any feedback, ideas, or shared experiences.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Made a game in a month, netted $250 after 3 days, disappointed fans of the genre.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ZoomerDev"> /u/ZoomerDev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kexnhw/made_and_released_a_steam_game_in_a_month_heres/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kexnhw/made_and_released_a_steam_game_in_a_month_heres/">[comments]</a></span></div>

One got a refund for &quot;multiplayer does not work&quot; (it&#39;s a solo game lol). Also all of the comments are in chinese, and some of them are using chinese number slang.

Brutally honest Post Mortem of We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Two Years Later: What We Got Right, What We Got Wrong, and What We Learned</h1> <p>When we started working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/">We. The Refugees: Ticket to Europe</a>, we didn’t have a publisher, a studio, or even a real budget. Just an idea, a lot of questions, and more ambition than we probably should’ve had. Two years after release, the game was nominated to and received international awards, has earned a dedicated niche following, and a respectable 83% positive rating on Steam — but financially, it hasn’t been the success we hoped for.</p> <p>This post mortem is a look behind the curtain: how the game was born, how we pulled it off with limited resources, what mistakes we made (some of them big), and what we’d do differently next time. It’s part reflection, part open notebook — for fellow devs, curious players, and anyone wondering what it really takes to make a politically charged narrative game in 2020s Europe.</p> <p>Let’s start at the beginning.</p> <h1>The Origins of the Game</h1> <p>The idea behind <em>We. The Refugees</em> goes back to 2014–2015, when news about the emerging refugee crisis began making global headlines. At the time, the two co-founders of Act Zero — Jędrzej Napiecek and Maciej Stańczyk — were QA testers working on <em>The Witcher 3</em> at Testronic. During coffee breaks, they’d talk about their desire to create something of their own: a narrative-driven game with a message. They were particularly inspired by <em>This War of Mine</em> from 11 bit studios — one of the first widely recognized examples of a so-called &quot;meaningful game.&quot; All of these ingredients became the base for the cocktail that would eventually become our first game. </p> <p>At first, the project was just a modest side hustle — an attempt to create a game about refugees that could help players better understand a complex issue. Over the next few years, we researched the topic, built a small team, and searched for funding. Eventually, we secured a micro-budget from a little-known publisher (who soon disappeared from the industry). That collaboration didn’t last long, but it gave us enough momentum to build a very bad prototype and organize a research trip to refugee camps on the Greek island of Lesbos.</p> <p>That trip changed everything. It made us realize how little we truly understood — even after years of preparation. The contrast between our secondhand knowledge and the reality on the ground was jarring. That confrontation became a defining theme of the game. We restructured the narrative around it: not as a refugee survival simulator, but as a story about someone trying — and often failing — to understand. In the new version, the player steps into the shoes of an amateur journalist at the start of his career. You can learn more about it in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Icb5bEAVwag?si=k6EdyYM1nys_ZeAm">documentary film </a>showcasing our development and creative process.</p> <p>But for a moment we have no money to continue the development of <em>We. The Refugees</em>. For the next year and a half, the studio kept itself afloat with contract work — mainly developing simulator games for companies in the PlayWay group — while we continued our hunt for funding. Finally, in 2019, we received an EU grant to build the game, along with a companion comic book and board game on the same subject. From the first conversation over coffee to actual financing, the road took about five years.</p> <h1>Budget and Production</h1> <p>The EU grant we received totaled 425,000 PLN — roughly $100,000. But that sum had to stretch across three different projects: a video game, a board game, and a comic book. While some costs overlapped — particularly in visual development — we estimate that the actual budget allocated to the <em>We. The Refugees</em> video game was somewhere in the range of $70,000–$80,000.</p> <p>The production timeline stretched from May 2020 to May 2023 — three full years. That’s a long time for an indie game of this size, but the reasons were clear:</p> <p>First, the script was enormous — around 300,000 words, or roughly two-thirds the length of The <em>Witcher 3</em>’s narrative. Writing alone took nearly 20 months.</p> <p>Second, the budget didn’t allow for a full-time team. We relied on freelance contracts, which meant most contributors worked part-time, often on evenings and weekends. That slowed us down — but it also gave us access to talented professionals from major studios, who wouldn’t have been available under a traditional staffing model.</p> <p>We built the game in the Godot engine, mainly because it’s open-source and produces lightweight builds — which we hoped would make future mobile ports easier (a plan that ultimately didn’t materialize). As our CTO and designer Maciej Stańczyk put it:</p> <p><em>Technically speaking, Godot’s a solid tool — but porting is a pain. For this project, I’d still choose it. But if you’re thinking beyond PC, you need to plan carefully.</em></p> <p>Over the course of production, around 15 people contributed in some capacity. Most worked on narrowly defined tasks — like creating a few specific animations. About 10 were involved intermittently, while the core team consisted of about five people who carried the project forward. Of those, only one — our CEO and lead writer Jędrzej Napiecek — worked on the game full-time. The rest balanced it with other jobs.</p> <p>We ran the project entirely remotely. In hindsight, it was the only viable option. Renting a physical studio would’ve burned through our budget in a matter of months. And for a game like this — long on writing, short on gameplay mechanics — full-time roles weren’t always necessary. A full-time programmer, for instance, would’ve spent much of the project waiting for things to script. Given the constraints, we think the budget was spent as efficiently as possible.</p> <h1>Marketing and Wishlists</h1> <p>For the first leg of the marketing campaign, we handled everything ourselves — posting regularly on Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter. Between July and October 2022, those grassroots efforts brought in around 1,000 wishlists. Modest, but promising. During that period, we took part in Steam Next Fest — a decision we later came to regret. Sure, our wishlist count doubled, but we were starting from such a low base that the absolute numbers were underwhelming. In hindsight, we would’ve seen a much bigger impact if we had joined the event closer to launch, when our wishlist count was higher and the game had more visibility.</p> <p>Then, in November 2022, our publisher came on board. Within just two days, our wishlist count jumped by 2,000. It looked impressive — at first. They told us the spike came from mailing list campaigns. But when we dug into the data, we found something odd: the vast majority of those wishlists came from Russia. Actual sales in that region? Just a few dozen copies... We still don’t know what really happened — whether it was a mailing list fluke, a bot issue, or something else entirely. But the numbers didn’t add up, and that initial spike never translated into meaningful engagement. </p> <p>From there, wishlist growth slowed. Over the next six months — the lead-up to launch — we added about 1,000 more wishlists. To put it bluntly: in four months of DIY marketing, we’d done about as well as the publisher did over half a year. Not exactly a glowing endorsement.</p> <p>That said, the launch itself went reasonably well. The publisher managed to generate some nice visibility, generating about 50K visits on our Steam Page on the day of the premiere. You can compare it to our lifetime results - we managed to gather 12.33 million impressions and 1,318,116 visits of our Steam Page during both marketing and sales phases.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that nearly 50 titles launched on Steam the same day we did. Among them, we managed to climb to the #3 spot in terms of popularity. A small victory, sure — but one that highlights just how fierce the competition is on the platform. </p> <p>Looking back, the launch may not have delivered blockbuster sales, but it did well enough to keep the game from vanishing into the depths of Steam’s archive. It’s still alive, still visible, and — to our mild surprise — still selling, if slowly.</p> <p>After the premiere we saw a healthy bump: roughly 2,500 new wishlists in the month following release. By early June 2023, our total had climbed to around 6,300. After that, growth was slower but steady. We crossed the 10,000-wishlist mark in May 2024, a full year after launch. Since then, things have tapered off. Over the past twelve months, we’ve added just 1,500 more wishlists. </p> <p>During the promotional period, we also visited many in-person events: EGX London, PAX East Boston, GDC San Francisco, BLON Klaipeda. We managed to obtain the budget for these trips - mostly - from additional grants for the international development of the company. And while these trips allowed us to establish interesting industry contacts, the impact on wish lists was negligible. In our experience - it is better to invest money in online marketing than to pay for expensive stands at fairs.</p> <h1>Sales</h1> <p>Two years post-launch, We. The Refugees has sold 3,653 copies — plus around 259 retail activations — with 211 refunds. That’s a 5.8% refund rate, and an average of about five sales per day since release.</p> <p>China turned out to be our biggest market by far, accounting for 46% of all sales. The credit goes entirely to our Chinese partner, Gamersky, who handled localization and regional distribution. They did outstanding work — not just on the numbers, but on communication, responsiveness, and professionalism. Partnering with them was, without question, one of our best decisions. Our second-largest market was the U.S. at 16%, followed by Poland at 6%. That last figure might seem surprising, but we need to highlight that Act Zero is a Polish studio and the game is fully localized in Polish.</p> <p>Looking at our daily sales chart, the pattern is clear: most purchases happen during Steam festivals or seasonal sales. Outside of those events, daily numbers drop sharply — often to near-zero. As of now, our lifetime conversion rate sits at 10.7%, slightly below the Steam average.</p> <p>We haven’t yet tested ultra-deep discounts (like -90%), which may still offer some upside. But for now, the game’s long tail is exactly what you&#39;d expect from a niche, dialogue-heavy title without a major marketing push.</p> <p>Initially, we had higher hopes. We believed 10,000 copies in the first year was a realistic target. But a mix of limited marketing, creative risks, and production compromises made that goal harder to reach. In the next section, we’ll try to unpack what exactly went wrong — and what we’d do differently next time.</p> <h1>Mistakes &amp; Lessons Learned</h1> <ul> <li><strong>No Map or True Exploration</strong></li> </ul> <p><em>We. The Refugees</em> is a game about a journey from North Africa to Southern Europe — yet ironically, the game lacks the feeling of freedom and movement that such a journey should evoke. The player follows a mostly linear, pre-scripted route with some branches along the way. The main route of the journey is more or less the same, although there are different ways of exploring specific sections of the route. Even a simple map with optional detours could’ve dramatically improved immersion. Moving gameplay choices about the next destination onto such a map would also be highly recommended — it would definitely liven up interactions on the left side of the screen, where illustrations are displayed. Clicking on them would simply offer a refreshing change from the usual dialogue choices shown beneath the text on the right side of the screen. After all, the “journey” is a powerful narrative and gameplay topos — one that many players find inherently engaging. Unfortunately, our game didn’t reflect this in its systems or structure.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Too Little Gameplay, Too Much Reading</strong></li> </ul> <p>Players didn’t feel like they were actively participating — and in a modern RPG or visual novel, interactivity is key. Introducing simple mechanics, like dice checks during major decisions or a basic quest log, would’ve helped structure the action and add dramatic tension. These are familiar tools that players have come to expect, and we shouldn&#39;t have overlooked them.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Personality Traits with No Real Impact</strong></li> </ul> <p>The player character had a set of personality traits, but they were largely cosmetic. Occasionally, a trait would unlock a unique dialogue option, but in practice, these had little to no impact on how the story unfolded. We missed a major opportunity here. Traits could have formed the backbone of a dice-based gameplay system, where they meaningfully influenced outcomes by providing bonuses or penalties to specific checks — adding depth, variety, and replay value.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Mispositioned Pitch</strong></li> </ul> <p>From the start, we positioned the game as a story about refugees — a highly politicized topic that immediately turned away many potential players. Some assumed we were pushing propaganda. But our actual intent was far more nuanced: we tried to show the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, without preaching or moralizing — trusting players to draw their own conclusions from the situations we presented.</p> <p>Looking back, a better framing would’ve been: a young journalist’s first investigative assignment — which happens to deal with refugees. This would’ve made the game far more approachable. The refugee theme could remain central, but framed as part of a broader, more relatable fantasy of becoming a journalist.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Problematic Protagonist</strong></li> </ul> <p>We aimed to create a non-heroic protagonist — not a hardened war reporter, but an ordinary person, similar to the average player. Someone unprepared, naive, flawed. Our goal was to satirize the Western gaze, but many players found this portrayal alienating. It was hard to empathize with a character who often made dumb mistakes or revealed glaring ignorance.</p> <p>The idea itself wasn’t bad — challenging the “cool protagonist” fantasy can be powerful — but we executed it clumsily. We gave the main character too many flaws, to the point where satire and immersion clashed. A better approach might’ve been to delegate those satirical traits to a companion character, letting the player avatar stay more neutral. As our CTO Maciej Stańczyk put it:</p> <p><em>I still think a protagonist who’s unlikable at first isn’t necessarily a bad idea — but you have to spell it out clearly, because players are used to stepping into the shoes of someone cool right away.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>A Static, Uninviting Prologue</strong></li> </ul> <p>The game’s prologue begins with the protagonist sitting in his apartment, staring at a laptop (starting conditions exactly the same as the situation of our player right now!), moments before leaving for Africa. On paper, it seemed clever — metatextual, symbolic. In practice, it was static and uninvolving. Many players dropped the game during this segment.</p> <p>Ironically, the very next scene — set in Africa — was widely praised as engaging and atmospheric. In hindsight, we should’ve opened in medias res, grabbing the player’s attention from the first few minutes. Again, Maciej Stańczyk summed it up well:</p> <p><em>The prologue is well-written and nicely sets up the character, but players expect a hook in the first few minutes — like starting the story right in the middle of the action.</em></p> <ul> <li><strong>No Saving Option</strong></li> </ul> <p>The decision to disable saving at any moment during gameplay turned out to be a mistake. Our intention was to emphasize the weight of each choice and discourage save scumming. However, in practice, it became a frustrating limitation—especially for our most dedicated and engaged players, who wanted to explore different narrative branches but were repeatedly forced to replay large portions of the game.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Late and Weak Marketing</strong></li> </ul> <p>We started marketing way too late. We had no budget for professionals and little expertise ourselves. We tried to learn on the fly, but lacked time, resources, and experience. What we could have done better was involve the community much earlier. As Maciej Stańczyk notes:</p> <p><em>Biggest lesson? Involve your community as early as possible. Traditional marketing only works if you’ve got at least a AA+ budget. Indies have to be loud and visible online from the earliest stages — like the guy behind Roadwarden, whose posts I saw years before launch.</em></p> <p><strong>Final Thoughts on Mistakes</strong></p> <p>If we were to start this project all over again, two priorities would guide our design: more interactive gameplay and freedom to explore the journey via a world map. Both would significantly increase immersion and player engagement.</p> <p>Could we have achieved that with the budget we had? Probably not. But that doesn’t change the fact that now we know better — and we intend to apply those lessons to our next project.</p> <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1> <p>Two years after launch, we’re proud of how <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094580/We_The_Refugees_Ticket_to_Europe/">We. The Refugees</a> has been received. The game holds an 83% positive rating on Steam and has earned nominations and awards at several international festivals. We won Games for Good Award at IndieX in Portugal, received a nomination to Best in Civics Award at Games for Change in New York, and another to Aware Game Awards at BLON in Lithuania. For a debut indie title built on a shoestring budget, that’s not nothing.</p> <p>We’re also proud of the final product itself. Despite some narrative missteps, we believe the writing holds up — both in terms of quality and relevance. As the years go by, the game may even gain value as a historical snapshot of a particular state of mind. The story ends just as the COVID-19 lockdowns begin — a moment that, in hindsight, marked the end of a certain era. In the five years since, history has accelerated. The comfortable notion of the “End of History” (to borrow from Fukuyama) — so common in Western discourse — has given way to a harsher, more conflict-driven reality. In that context, our protagonist might be seen as a portrait of a fading worldview. A symbol of the mindset that once shaped liberal Western optimism, now slipping into obsolescence. And perhaps that alone is reason enough for the game to remain interesting in the years to come — as a kind of time capsule, a record of a specific cultural moment.</p> <p>This reflection also marks the closing of a chapter for our studio. While we still have a few surprises in store for <em>We. The Refugees</em>, our attention has already shifted to what lies ahead. We’re now putting the finishing touches on the prototype for <em>Venus Rave</em> — a sci-fi RPG with a much stronger gameplay core (which, let’s be honest, wasn’t hard to improve given how minimal gameplay was in <em>We. The Refugees</em>). The next phase of development still lacks a secured budget, but thanks to everything we’ve learned on our first project, we’re walking into this one better prepared — and determined not to repeat the same mistakes.</p> <p>Whether we get to make that next game depends on whether someone out there believes in us enough to invest. Because, to be completely honest, the revenue from our first title won’t be enough to fund another one on its own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ActZeroGames"> /u/ActZeroGames </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1keoles/2_years_since_launch_3653_copies_sold_several/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1keoles/2_years_since_launch_3653_copies_sold_several/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question. I’ve been a systems programmer for years with C, Go, and Rust, and surprisingly I’ve been checking and second guessing myself about how much I REALLY know about how all of this stuff works under the hood. </p> <p>The way I understand Go’s GC (simplified) is it will periodically freeze the program, walk over the memory blocks, check that there is nothing in the program that could still be referencing a given heap allocation, and then mark those blocks, freeing them when it can. </p> <p>Why does this have to be synchronous? Or, maybe more accurately, why can’t this be done <em>in parallel</em> with the main program execution?</p> <p>In the model in my head, something like this would work: 1. Program is running, made a bunch of allocations, blah blah blah 2. Runtime has a GC thread (an OS thread, not a green thread, so likely running on its own core) 3. GC thread rapidly inspects the memory space of the app while it’s running (a lock on anything wouldn’t be necessary since it’s just inspecting the memory, if it changes under it while being inspected that run is just discarded) 4. If it sees something is no longer referenced, it can destroy that memory block in a different thread while the app is running</p> <p>Obviously assume here I’m talking about a multi-threaded OS and multi core CPU and not micro controllers where this is not possible. </p> <p>Is there any reason that something like this is not possible or wouldn’t work?</p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Background3759"> /u/Cute_Background3759 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1keo1t0/why_does_the_go_gc_have_to_pause/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1keo1t0/why_does_the_go_gc_have_to_pause/">[comments]</a></span></div>
