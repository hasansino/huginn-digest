            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h2>The problem</h2> <p>It is well known that <code>undefined</code> doesn&#39;t exist in Go. There are only zero values.</p> <p>For years, Go developers have been struggling with the JSON struct tag <code>omitempty</code> to handle those use-cases.</p> <p><code>omitempty</code> didn&#39;t cover all cases very well and can be fussy. Indeed, the definition of a value being &quot;empty&quot; isn&#39;t very clear.</p> <p>When marshaling: - Slices and maps are empty if they&#39;re <code>nil</code> or have a length of zero. - A pointer is empty if <code>nil</code>. - A struct is never empty. - A string is empty if it has a length of zero. - Other types are empty if they have their zero-value.</p> <p>And when unmarshaling... it&#39;s impossible to tell the difference between a missing field in the input and a present field having Go&#39;s zero-value.</p> <p>There are so many different cases to keep in mind when working with <code>omitempty</code>. It&#39;s inconvenient and error-prone.</p> <h2>The workaround</h2> <p>Go developers have been relying on a workaround: using pointers everywhere for fields that can be absent, in combination with the <code>omitempty</code> tag. It makes it easier to handle both marshaling and unmarshaling: - When marshaling, you know a <code>nil</code> field will never be visible in the output. - When unmarshaling, you know a field wasn&#39;t present in the input if it&#39;s <code>nil</code>.</p> <p>Except... that&#39;s not entirely true. There are still use-cases that are not covered by this workaround. When you need to handle nullable values (where <code>null</code> is actually value that your service accepts), you&#39;re back to square one: - when unmarshaling, it&#39;s impossible to tell if the input contains the field or not. - when marshaling, you cannot use <code>omitempty</code>, otherwise <code>nil</code> values won&#39;t be present in the output.</p> <p>Using pointers is also error-prone and not very convenient. They require many nil-checks and dereferencing everywhere.</p> <h2>The solution</h2> <p>With the introduction of the <code>omitzero</code> tag in <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.24">Go 1.24</a>, we finally have all the tools we need to build a clean solution.</p> <p><code>omitzero</code> is way simpler than <code>omitempty</code>: if the field has its zero-value, it is omitted. It also works for structures, which are considered &quot;zero&quot; if all their fields have their zero-value.</p> <p>For example, it is now simple as that to omit a <code>time.Time</code> field:</p> <p><code>go type MyStruct struct{ SomeTime time.Time `json:&quot;,omitzero&quot;` } </code> Done are the times of <code>0001-01-01T00:00:00Z</code>!</p> <p>However, there are still some issues that are left unsolved: - Handling nullable values when marshaling. - Differentiating between a zero value and undefined value. - Differentiating between a <code>null</code> and absent value when unmarshaling.</p> <h3>Undefined wrapper type</h3> <p>Because <code>omitzero</code> handles zero structs gracefully, we can build a new wrapper type that will solve all of this for us!</p> <p>The trick is to play with the zero value of a struct in combination with the <code>omitzero</code> tag.</p> <p><code>go type Undefined[T any] struct { Val T Present bool } </code></p> <p>If <code>Present</code> is <code>true</code>, then the structure will not have its zero value. We will therefore know that the field is present (not undefined)!</p> <p>Now, we need to add support for the <code>json.Marshaler</code> and <code>json.Unmarshaler</code> interfaces so our type will behave as expected: ```go func (u *Undefined[T]) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error { if err := json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;u.Val); err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(&quot;Undefined: couldn&#39;t unmarshal JSON: %w&quot;, err) }</p> <pre><code>u.Present = true return nil </code></pre> <p>}</p> <p>func (u Undefined[T]) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) { data, err := json.Marshal(u.Val) if err != nil { return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;Undefined: couldn&#39;t JSON marshal: %w&quot;, err) } return data, nil }</p> <p>func (u Undefined[T]) IsZero() bool { return !u.Present } ``<code> Because</code>UnmarshalJSON<code>is never called if the input doesn&#39;t contain a matching field, we know that</code>Present<code>will remain</code>false<code>. But if it is present, we unmarshal the value and always set</code>Present<code>to</code>true`.</p> <p>For marshaling, we don&#39;t want to output the wrapper structure, so we just marshal the value. The field will be omitted if not present thanks to the <code>omitzero</code> struct tag. </p> <p>As a bonus, we also implemented <code>IsZero()</code>, which is supported by the standard JSON library:</p> <blockquote> <p>If the field type has an IsZero() bool method, that will be used to determine whether the value is zero.</p> </blockquote> <p>The generic parameter <code>T</code> allows us to use this wrapper with absolutely anything. We now have a practical and unified way to handle <code>undefined</code> for all types in Go!</p> <h3>Going further</h3> <p>We could go further and apply the same logic for database scanning. This way it will be possible to tell if a field was selected or not.</p> <p>You can find a full implementation of the <code>Undefined</code> type in the <a href="https://github.com/go-goyave/goyave">Goyave framework</a>, alongside many other useful tools and features.</p> <p>Happy coding!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImAFlyingPancake"> /u/ImAFlyingPancake </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k6283p/finally_a_practical_solution_for_undefined_fields/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k6283p/finally_a_practical_solution_for_undefined_fields/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve seen many requests here for something like this and I&#39;ve seen plenty of understandable distaste for ORMs, so I thought this was worth sharing here.</p> <p>The latest release contains a completely dynamic admin panel, all server-side rendered with the help of <a href="https://echo.labstack.com/">Echo</a>, for managing all of your entities that you define with <a href="https://entgo.io/">Ent</a>. Each entity type will automatically expose a pageable, tabular list of entities along with the ability to add, edit, and delete any of them. You can see some example <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda?tab=readme-ov-file#screenshots">screenshots</a>.</p> <p>This started by exploring great projects like <a href="https://pocketbase.io/">PocketBase</a> and <a href="https://fastschema.com/">FastSchema</a> which both provide dynamic admin panels. I considered rebuilding the project to be based on either of them, but for many reasons, I felt neither were a good fit.</p> <p>Since Ent provides incredible <a href="https://entgo.io/docs/extensions">code-generation</a>, I was curious how far you could get with just that. My first attempt started with <a href="https://entgo.io/blog/2022/02/15/generate-rest-crud-with-ent-and-ogen/">ogent</a> but after exploring the code and extension API, I realized how easy it is to just write what you need from scratch.</p> <h2>The approach and challenges faced</h2> <ul> <li>Declare a <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/extension.go#L19-L36">custom Ent extension</a> for code-generation. This executes the templates you define, passing in the <code>entc/gen.Graph</code> structure that declares your entire entity schema.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/templates/types.tmpl#L4">Generate flat types</a> for each entity type with form tags for Echo struct binding, using pointer fields for optional, sensitive and nillable fields, excluding bools, as well as those with default values. This allows fields to be non-required during creation and editing, though those operations <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/templates/handler.tmpl#L126-L151">differ</a> in how you have to handle empty values.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/templates/handler.tmpl#L4">Generate a handler</a> to provide CRUD methods for all entity types.</li> <li>Since the web app needs to be dynamic (not rely on code-generation), and since we want separation between the web app and the admin handler (to allow for full control), the handler also needs a generic interface for all methods, which can operate using just the entity type name and entity ID. So, while the generated handler has methods such as <code>UserDelete()</code>, it also has a generic <code>Delete()</code> method that takes in the entity type name string and routes that to <code>UserDelete()</code>.</li> <li>The previous could be avoided if you wanted the entire web side of the admin panel to be code-generated, but that did not seem like a reasonable approach because all changes to the web code would require you to adjust code templates and re-generate code. It also makes it much harder to expand your admin panel to include non-entity pages and operations and it blurs the lines too much between your ORM and your web app.</li> <li>To plug the web app in to the generated admin handler, we start by using the Ent&#39;s <em>gen.Graph</em> to dynamically build all <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/pkg/handlers/admin.go#L46">routes</a>.</li> <li>Within each <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/pkg/handlers/admin.go#L92">route handler</a>, you can then see why the generic name and ID interface is required - the entity type, during the loop used to build the routes, is passed in, and that name is passed to the admin handler for the given operation.</li> <li>To keep everything generic, only string values are passed back and forth between the web handler and admin handler for list, create, and edit operations. Lists/tables use a provided <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/types.go#L21">type</a> which contains everything to render a table, and create/edit operations use <code>url.Values</code> since that&#39;s also what a processed web form provides.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/admin/handler.go#L299">Pre-process</a> form data before passing it to Echo&#39;s struct binding in order to prevent parsing errors on empty fields (especially <code>time.Time</code>) and converting the datetime values provided by the <code>datetime-local</code> form element to the format the Echo expects <code>time.Time</code> fields to come in as.</li> <li>In order to support editing edges (relationships), all editable edges must be bound by <a href="https://entgo.io/docs/schema-edges#edge-field">edge fields</a>.</li> <li>Dynamically building an HTML form for <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/pkg/ui/forms/admin_entity.go#L17">creating/editing entities</a> was quite difficult, but we can again leverage the <code>gen.Graph</code> data structure to do it. It&#39;s hard to imagine being able to do this without <a href="https://www.gomponents.com/">gomponents</a> (or something similar).</li> <li>All entity validation and pre-processing must be defined within the schema and entity hooks (<a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/blob/v0.22.0/ent/schema/user.go">example</a>).</li> </ul> <p>This code is still very new and will most likely change and improve quite a lot over time. It&#39;s also very likely that there&#39;s bugs or missing functionality (the amount of potential cases in an Ent schema is endless). This is considered in beta as of now. There&#39;s also a lot of <a href="https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda/tree/v0.22.0?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap">features</a> I hope to add eventually.</p> <p>If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mstef9"> /u/mstef9 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k5yjeb/codegenerating_a_dynamic_admin_panel_with_ent_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k5yjeb/codegenerating_a_dynamic_admin_panel_with_ent_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;d like to share a Go library I&#39;ve built called <a href="https://github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree">go-lrutree</a>. It&#39;s a small, thread-safe, generic cache designed specifically for tree-structured data.</p> <p><strong>The Problem It Solves:</strong></p> <p>Popular LRU cache implementations (like hashicorp/golang-lru) work well for flat key-value pairs.</p> <p>But when you‚Äôre working with hierarchical data - think org charts, file paths, category trees, or geo-locations - flat caching can fall short.</p> <p>For example: if you cache a city, you likely want its state and country to remain cached too. But traditional LRU eviction might evict a parent while children remain, breaking the logical structure.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree">go-lrutree</a> solves this by enforcing the rule: <strong>if a node is in the cache, all its ancestors are too</strong>. When you access a node, its entire ancestry is marked as recently used - keeping the chain intact and eviction-safe.</p> <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;github.com/vasayxtx/go-lrutree&quot; ) type OrgItem struct { Name string } func main() { // Create a new cache with a maximum size of 4 entries and an eviction callback. cache := lrutree.NewCache[string, OrgItem](4, lrutree.WithOnEvict(func(node lrutree.CacheNode[string, OrgItem]) { fmt.Printf(&quot;Evicted: %s (key=%s, parent=%s)\n&quot;, node.Value.Name, node.Key, node.ParentKey) })) // Add nodes to the cache. _ = cache.AddRoot(&quot;company&quot;, OrgItem{&quot;My Company&quot;}) _ = cache.Add(&quot;engineering&quot;, OrgItem{&quot;Engineering department&quot;}, &quot;company&quot;) _ = cache.Add(&quot;frontend&quot;, OrgItem{&quot;Frontend team&quot;}, &quot;engineering&quot;) _ = cache.Add(&quot;backend&quot;, OrgItem{&quot;Backend team&quot;}, &quot;engineering&quot;) // Get the value by key. // &quot;frontend&quot; node and all its ancestors (&quot;engineering&quot; and &quot;company&quot; nodes) are marked as recently used. if cacheNode, ok := cache.Get(&quot;frontend&quot;); ok { fmt.Printf(&quot;Get: %s (key=%s, parent=%s)\n&quot;, cacheNode.Value.Name, cacheNode.Key, cacheNode.ParentKey) // Output: Get: Frontend team (key=frontend, parent=engineering) } // Get the full branch from the root to the node with key &quot;backend&quot;. // &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;engineering&quot;, and &quot;company&quot; nodes are marked as recently used. branch := cache.GetBranch(&quot;backend&quot;) for i, node := range branch { fmt.Printf(&quot;GetBranch[%d]: %s (key=%s, parent=%s)\n&quot;, i, node.Value.Name, node.Key, node.ParentKey) } // Output: // GetBranch[0]: My Company (key=company, parent=) // GetBranch[1]: Engineering department (key=engineering, parent=company) // GetBranch[2]: Backend team (key=backend, parent=engineering) // Peek the value by key without updating the LRU order. if cacheNode, ok := cache.Peek(&quot;frontend&quot;); ok { fmt.Printf(&quot;Peek: %s (key=%s, parent=%s)\n&quot;, cacheNode.Value.Name, cacheNode.Key, cacheNode.ParentKey) // Output: Peek: Frontend team (key=frontend, parent=engineering) } // Add a new node exceeding the cache&#39;s maximum size. // The least recently used leaf node (&quot;frontend&quot;) is evicted. _ = cache.Add(&quot;architects&quot;, OrgItem{&quot;Architects team&quot;}, &quot;engineering&quot;) // Output: Evicted: Frontend team (key=frontend, parent=engineering) } </code></pre> <p><strong>Looking for Feedback!</strong></p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear from the Go community:</p> <ul> <li>Does this hierarchical caching concept resonate with you? Can you envision use cases for it?</li> <li>Any feedback on the API design or the implementation approach?</li> <li>Suggestions for improvements or features?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmploymentPlayful553"> /u/EmploymentPlayful553 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k5hcgd/golrutree_hierarchical_lru_cache_that_guarantees/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k5hcgd/golrutree_hierarchical_lru_cache_that_guarantees/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We&#39;re releasing Burn 0.17.0 today, a massive update that improves the Deep Learning Framework in every aspect! Enhanced hardware support, new acceleration features, faster kernels, and better compilers - all to improve performance and reliability.</p> <h2>Broader Support</h2> <p>Mac users will be happy, as we‚Äôve created a custom Metal compiler for our WGPU backend to leverage tensor core instructions, speeding up matrix multiplication up to 3x. This leverages our revamped cpp compiler, where we introduced dialects for Cuda, Metal and HIP (ROCm for AMD) and fixed some memory errors that destabilized training and inference. This is all part of our CubeCL backend in Burn, where all kernels are written purely in Rust.</p> <p>A lot of effort has been put into improving our main compute-bound operations, namely matrix multiplication and convolution. Matrix multiplication has been refactored a lot, with an improved double buffering algorithm, improving the performance on various matrix shapes. We also added support for NVIDIA&#39;s Tensor Memory Allocator (TMA) on their latest GPU lineup, all integrated within our matrix multiplication system. Since it is very flexible, it is also used within our convolution implementations, which also saw impressive speedup since the last version of Burn.</p> <p>All of those optimizations are available for all of our backends built on top of CubeCL. Here&#39;s a summary of all the platforms and precisions supported:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Type</th> <th>CUDA</th> <th>ROCm</th> <th>Metal</th> <th>Wgpu</th> <th>Vulkan</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>f16</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td>bf16</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> </tr> <tr> <td>flex32</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td>tf32</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f32</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td>f64</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚ùå</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h2>Fusion</h2> <p>In addition, we spent a lot of time optimizing our tensor operation fusion compiler in Burn, to fuse memory-bound operations to compute-bound kernels. This release increases the number of fusable memory-bound operations, but more importantly handles mixed vectorization factors, broadcasting, indexing operations and more. Here&#39;s a table of all memory-bound operations that can be fused:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Version</th> <th>Tensor Operations</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Since v0.16</td> <td>Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Powf, Abs, Exp, Log, Log1p, Cos, Sin, Tanh, Erf, Recip, Assign, Equal, Lower, Greater, LowerEqual, GreaterEqual, ConditionalAssign</td> </tr> <tr> <td>New in v0.17</td> <td>Gather, Select, Reshape, SwapDims</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Right now we have three classes of fusion optimizations:</p> <ul> <li>Matrix-multiplication</li> <li>Reduction kernels (Sum, Mean, Prod, Max, Min, ArgMax, ArgMin)</li> <li>No-op, where we can fuse a series of memory-bound operations together not tied to a compute-bound kernel</li> </ul> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Fusion Class</th> <th>Fuse-on-read</th> <th>Fuse-on-write</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>Matrix Multiplication</td> <td>‚ùå</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Reduction</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> <tr> <td>No-Op</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> <td>‚úÖ</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>We plan to make more compute-bound kernels fusable, including convolutions, and add even more comprehensive broadcasting support, such as fusing a series of broadcasted reductions into a single kernel.</p> <h2>Benchmarks</h2> <p>Benchmarks speak for themselves. Here are benchmark results for standard models using f32 precision with the CUDA backend, measured on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU. Those speedups are expected to behave similarly across all of our backends mentioned above.</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Version</th> <th>Benchmark</th> <th>Median time</th> <th>Fusion speedup</th> <th>Version improvement</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>ResNet-50 inference (fused)</td> <td>6.318ms</td> <td>27.37%</td> <td>4.43x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>ResNet-50 inference</td> <td>8.047ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>3.48x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>ResNet-50 inference (fused)</td> <td>27.969ms</td> <td>3.58%</td> <td>1x (baseline)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>ResNet-50 inference</td> <td>28.970ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>0.97x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>RoBERTa inference (fused)</td> <td>19.192ms</td> <td>20.28%</td> <td>1.26x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>RoBERTa inference</td> <td>23.085ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>1.05x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>RoBERTa inference (fused)</td> <td>24.184ms</td> <td>13.10%</td> <td>1x (baseline)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>RoBERTa inference</td> <td>27.351ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>0.88x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> <td>----</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>RoBERTa training (fused)</td> <td>89.280ms</td> <td>27.18%</td> <td>4.86x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.17.0</td> <td>RoBERTa training</td> <td>113.545ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>3.82x</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>RoBERTa training (fused)</td> <td>433.695ms</td> <td>3.67%</td> <td>1x (baseline)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>0.16.1</td> <td>RoBERTa training</td> <td>449.594ms</td> <td>-</td> <td>0.96x</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Another advantage of carrying optimizations across runtimes: it seems our optimized WGPU memory management has a big impact on Metal: for long running training, our metal backend executes 4 to 5 times faster compared to LibTorch.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I‚Äôve had this idea stuck in my head that I can&#39;t shake off. Can Rust eventually stop supporting older editions?</p> <p>For example, starting with the 2030 edition and the corresponding <code>rustc</code> version, <code>rustc</code> could drop support for the 2015 edition. This would allow us to clean up old code paths and improve the maintainability of the compiler, which gets more complex over time. It could also open the door to removing deprecated items from the standard library - especially if the editions where they were used are no longer supported. We could even introduce a <code>forbid</code> lint on the deprecated items to ease the transition.</p> <p>This approach aligns well with Rust‚Äôs ‚ÄúStability Without Stagnation‚Äù philosophy and could improve the developer experience both for core contributors and end users.</p> <p>Of course, I understand the importance of giving deprecated items enough time (4 editions or more) before removing them, to avoid a painful transition like Python 2 to Python 3.</p> <p>The main downside that I found is related to security: if a vulnerability is found in code using an unsupported edition, the only option would be to upgrade to a supported one (e.g., from 2015 to 2018 in the earlier example).</p> <p>Other downsides include the fact that unsupported editions will not support the newest editions, and the newest editions will not support the unsupported ones at all. Unsupported editions will support newer editions up to the most recent <code>rustc</code> version that still supports the unsupported edition.</p> <p>P.S. For things like <code>std::i32::MAX</code>, the rules could be relaxed, since there are already direct, fully equivalent replacements.</p> <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, I feel like I‚Äôve seen somewhere that the <code>std</code> crate might be separated from <code>rustc</code> in the future and could have its own versioning model that allows for breaking changes. So maybe deprecating things via edition boundaries wouldn‚Äôt make as much sense.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dpytaylo"> /u/dpytaylo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k5yc20/is_it_possible_for_rust_to_stop_supporting_older/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k5yc20/is_it_possible_for_rust_to_stop_supporting_older/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It&#39;s a 2D roguelike game (think Slay the Spire but instead of a deck builder, it has RPG elements such as leveling, learning spells and skills, equipping gear, etc).<br/> I&#39;m a programmer and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been focusing on so far, but now I feel it&#39;s time to look into the art side of things. However, I&#39;m pretty art-illiterate so I figured I&#39;d look for professional help for custom art, so I&#39;m checking out ArtStation, Fiverr and GameDevClassifieds to see if I can find an artist to commission custom game art.</p> <p><strong>The things is, though, that I don&#39;t really know where to start and what to ask for.</strong><br/> Do I ask for concept art for my main characters? Or directly ask for character art with animations? Do I ask the artist to help me set up a style / color palette for my game? Perhaps start with environment?</p> <p>I&#39;ll be commissioning assets for my main characters, enemies and different environments/biomes. At least, that&#39;s the main things I need. UI I think I&#39;ll handle later, and VFX I&#39;ll probably go with non-custom art.</p> <p>If anyone has any insights that would help me on my way, that would be very appreciated!</p> <p>I should add that so far I&#39;ve been using AI-generated and free assets just to have something to work with while I work on the game mechanics. But now I&#39;m looking to replace all of that with custom art. </p> <p>TLDR: First time game dev doesn&#39;t know where to begin when commissioning art (aside from finding an artist).</p> <p>/N</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/psleyman"> /u/psleyman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k68v0p/advice_needed_commissioning_art_for_first_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k68v0p/advice_needed_commissioning_art_for_first_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Spend enough time researching about game dev and you will see many aspiring developers have a burning desire to make a &quot;dream game&quot; they have on their head. Most of the time it&#39;s an unrealistic idea, but it&#39;s enough to motivate them to spend years learning and working on their craft. They dislike words like &#39;marketing&#39; and &#39;market demand&#39;, their priority is to create something for themselves. You could say they are artists, moved by the purity of their ideas and a desire for self expression.</p> <p>Well, I&#39;ve come to realise I&#39;m not quite like that. Not anymore, at least.</p> <p>I don&#39;t really have a lot of exciting and innovative game ideas in my head. I don&#39;t have a longing to create a work of art that explores the deepest parts of my soul. I don&#39;t have a game I want to improve upon, or a need to recreate a game from my childhood.</p> <p>And I still want to make games. And sell them on Steam. That&#39;s what excites me the most. </p> <p>I&#39;m well aware I won&#39;t live off this. Heck, I will be happy if my first game makes more than the $100 Steam fee. My motivation isn&#39;t really about making money, or I would be using this time to invest in my career or in another, more lucrative side hustle. I <em>want</em> to make games. But I want to make games that people want to play, and buy, have fun with and think &quot;this was a good time for a great value!&quot;. I want to make a good game, but also a good product. And I want to be extremely realistic about what I can do with the time, energy and skills I have. I&#39;m more of a project manager at heart than an artist. So I will make projects.</p> <p>I&#39;m sharing this in the hopes it will resonate with some of you. If it does, please remember you don&#39;t have to agonize over fitting neatly in a box. Each one of us is unique, and passionate in our own way about games. And if you still feel like you need someone to validate you, well, I just did.</p> <p>So be you an auteur, an enterpreneur, or anything else, be realistic about your expectations, stay true to what excites and moves you and carve your own path.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GoiabaRoll"> /u/GoiabaRoll </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k61n39/ive_realized_i_dont_have_a_dream_game_i_have_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k61n39/ive_realized_i_dont_have_a_dream_game_i_have_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>
