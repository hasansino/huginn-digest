On my machine, it handles ~7800 reqs/sec vs ~2800 reqs/sec for the Node.js version. Full benchmarks coming soon.</p> <p>Important: It&#39;s far from being production-ready.

If your application layer requires encryption, be sure to check it out. </p> <p>twoway supports two flows:<br/> - A one-to-one flow where a sender communicates with a single receiver. This flow is fully compatible with RFC 9458 Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP), and the chunked OHTTP draft RFC.<br/> - A one-to-many flow where a sender communicates with one or more receivers. Similar to the design of Apple&#39;s PCC. </p> <p>Other features include:<br/> - Compatibility with any transport, twoway deals with just the messages.<br/> - Chunked messages.<br/> - Custom HPKE suites implementation for specialized needs like cryptographic hardware modules. </p> <p>Let me know if you have questions.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I deal with market data quite a lot, and different venues have slightly different strings for different assets despite all containing the same data.</p> <p>For example the struct below can be represented in a few different ways</p> <p><code> // The derivative instrument struct OptionSpec { pair: CurrencyPair, strike: u64 expiration: DateTime&lt;Utc&gt;, put_call: PutCall, } </code></p> <p>Eg:</p> <ul> <li>JPYUSD-100000-P-04MAR23</li> <li>34 (if it&#39;s just an internal ID)</li> <li>JPY-100000-04MAR23-P</li> </ul> <p>Often I have this structure deeply nested in other structures, especially when sending it to front-end processes. So my solution to this has generally been using serde_with plus a type parameter, for example:</p> <p>```</p> <h1>[serde_as]</h1> <h1>[derive(Serialize)]</h1> <p>struct NestedStructure&lt;SerializationMarker = DefaultInternal&gt; { _ser: PhantomData&lt;SerializationMarker&gt;, #[serde_as(as = &quot;MapFirstKeyWins&lt;SerializationMarker, _&gt;&quot;)] map: HashMap&lt;OptionSpec, Valuation&gt; } ```</p> <p>So coercing between different serialization formats becomes free with transmute</p> <p>``` let very_nested_tructure = HashMap::&lt;ClientId, NestedStructure&gt;::new(); // switch to FE representation let exchange_repr: HashMap::&lt;ClientId, NestedStructure&lt;AsExchangeString&gt;&gt; = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(very_nested_tructure) };</p> <p>write(serde_json::to_string(&amp;exchange_repr)); ```</p> <p>This comes in really handy because I don&#39;t need to destructure the whole object just to set how it should be serialized. It&#39;s also sound when done correctly as the PhantomData is a ZST (as much as some people will scream unsafe ZST will probably never ever affect the Rust compiler lays types out without a massive change to the compiler). However it depends on team members not messing it up and it looks ugly.</p> <p>Are there any alternatives to this pattern? In the example I&#39;ve given you really <em>don&#39;t</em> want to remap the structure like so:</p> <p>```</p> <p>very<em>nested_tructure .into_iter() .map(|(k, v)| { // Override serialisation (k, NewTypeWrapper(v)) }) .collect::&lt;HashMap&lt;</em>, _&gt;&gt;() ```</p> <p>Firstly it&#39;s just as prone to being messed up, secondly, even with <code>opt-level=3</code> the compiler isn&#39;t smart enough to recognise this is actually a no-op transformation and will still rehash the keys (checked on godbolt.org), which for more complex keys can be a significant overhead. </p> <p>Of course I could also write a visitor for each root structure, but then I miss out on the auto-generated derive, which is just reimplementing manually what this does anyway, which is type-dispatch the serializer to a different visitor.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sonthonaxrk"> /u/sonthonaxrk </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o15yqo/what_are_some_ergonomic_alternatives_to_transmute/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o15yqo/what_are_some_ergonomic_alternatives_to_transmute/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But the industry was brutal. My last royalty check? Around $125 for six months of sales. Books rarely went international, and editors were constantly burned out trying to keep things afloat. The editor who helped me debut literally died from overwork. That was when it hit me: this system was not built to sustain the people inside it. Still, I kept writing. Because it&#39;s how I process life.</p> <p>Eventually, I left publishing, not because I wanted to stop telling stories, but because I couldn&#39;t survive in that space anymore. I drifted for a while and somehow ended up in games. Started small: writing dialogue and narrative design for other people&#39;s projects. Picked up Unity, got obsessed with visual storytelling, and learned as I went. Now, I&#39;m leading a small indie team working on a story-driven mystery visual novel. For the first time, I feel like I can explore themes that were too risky or niche in publishing, like mental illness, distorted perception, and unreliable narration.</p> <p>Is it easy? Hell no. But people are actually reading. Interacting. Sharing thoughts. That didn&#39;t happen with books. And somehow‚Ä¶ that makes all the years of frustration feel a little more worth it.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone </p> <p>I‚Äôm a game dev (about 5 years in) and I want to share the story of my current project, Tailor Simulator. It‚Äôs a tailoring shop management game I was inspired by my dad‚Äôs lifelong profession as a tailor. After having to <strong>s</strong>helf my previous PC project due to budget issues, I poured my heart into this game. I launched my Steam page on May 1, 2025, and 3.5 months later I only had 400 wish lists. Not great. I made several big mistakes that I hope others can learn from. Here are the four main ones, and how I am fixing them:</p> <p>Also, here is the link if you feel curiosity about it: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484750/Tailor_Simulator/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484750/Tailor_Simulator/</a></p> <p><strong>Mistake 1: Rushing for the June Steam Next Fest (and Missing It)</strong></p> <p>In April, I was rushing on the June Next Fest. I announced that I will have a demo and scrambled to finish it in time. I crunched, cut corners, and still couldn‚Äôt get a solid demo ready by the deadline. In the end, I missed the Next Fest cutoff entirely. My mistake was trying to force an unrealistic deadline. The demo wasn‚Äôt ready, and I shouldn‚Äôt have staked our marketing plans on that date. By aiming for Next Fest without a polished demo, I set myself up for disappointment and burned time/energy that could have been spent improving the game at a reasonable pace.</p> <p><strong>Mistake 2: Opening the Steam Store Page Too Early (with Incomplete Assets)</strong></p> <p>Excited (and a bit desperate) to start gathering wishlists, I rushed to publish my Steam page on May 1. Well before I was truly prepared. My store page went live with mostly incomplete assets: a placeholder logo, a hastily-made capsule image, and only a basic preview trailer. I figured that I would improve it over time, but first impressions are huge on Steam. Those first few weeks, anyone who stumbled on our page saw an unpolished presentation. I suspect many potential wishlisters took one look and said ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù The result? Very slow wishlist growth (just ~400 in over months). The lesson I learned: don‚Äôt put your store page up until you can wow players with it. It‚Äôs better to delay and launch with a strong trailer, great screenshots, and professional-looking art than to go up early and look half-baked. I was too eager, and it likely cost us a lot of early momentum.</p> <p><strong>Mistake 3: Using AI-Generated Art for Key Visuals</strong></p> <p>This one still makes me cringe. Because I lacked a dedicated artist and was on a tight budget, I leaned on AI-generated images to create our cover art and some promotional visuals. At the time I thought it was a clever shortcut. The images looked very okay to me, and it saved money. But oh boy, the community did not appreciate this. I got harsh backlash on social media and forums once people realized the art was AI-generated. Some comments were blunt: the art had that ‚ÄúAI look‚Äù and felt cheap or even ethically questionable. Instead of talking about my game‚Äôs features or fun factors, people were criticizing our use of AI art. It was a disaster for my image. I learned the hard way that using AI art in your marketing can backfire horribly. Not only can it look uncanny or generic, but many players and fellow devs see it as low-effort or against the spirit of supporting real artists. Also, in previous weeks I was scammed by my former artist who overused ai to cook logos and made me post the two logo alternatives to the community.</p> <p><strong>Mistake 4: Delaying Localization of the Store Page</strong></p> <p>Steam has a global audience, and many players browse in their native language. I knew this but I still put off localizing our Steam page (and store assets) for months because of budget constraints. Initially, my page was English-only with no localized descriptions or graphics. I told myself I would localize ‚Äúlater when we have more funds.‚Äù. Players who visited and didn‚Äôt see their language likely bounced. Also, an English-only page can hurt visibility in some regional storefronts. This was a clear mistake.</p> <p>After recognizing these blunders, I knew I had to course-correct fast. Here‚Äôs what I did to fix my mistakes and turn things around:</p> <p><strong>Skipped the June Next Fest, focused on October Instead:</strong> Once I missed June, I accepted it and refocused on our timelin<strong>e</strong>. Now, my game Tailor Simulator will be featured in October Next Fest. This time I am not scrambling last-minute. Rushing nearly killed my morale. Now, I am committed to hitting October‚Äôs festival with something truly solid.</p> <p><strong>Hired a Real Artist:</strong> I allocated budget to commission a professional artist for our key art, logo, and UI assets. My new cover art reflects the cozy, creative vibe of Tailor Simulator. Huge lesson learned: good art is worth the money, especially for your game‚Äôs first impression.</p> <p><strong>Fully Localized the Steam Page:</strong> I went from English-only to supporting 15+ languages for my store page text and assets. I‚Äôm talking about translated descriptions, captions on screenshots, even the trailer subtitles. This was a lot of effort (and expense) to coordinate translations. It seems obvious, but making our game <strong>accessible to a global audience</strong> early on is already paying off.</p> <p><strong>Announced a Free Demo Version:</strong> Instead of keeping our demo hidden for Next Fest only, I decided to launch it for everyone. This was a bit scary (what if people don‚Äôt like it? What if it gets ignored outside an event?), but ultimately, I believe it‚Äôs the right move. It gives players a taste of the game at their own pace, and it will serve as a funnel for wishlists regardless of any event.</p> <p>Finally, I refreshed my Steam store page with all these changes, new art, new localized text, and launched a free Demo. The store page feels so much more complete and representative of the game now. It‚Äôs still Tailor Simulator, the love-letter to my dad‚Äôs craft, but now it actually looks like the passion project I always meant it to be.</p> <p><strong>How I Feel Now:</strong> Honestly, it‚Äôs a rollercoaster of emotions. On one hand I was energized and hopeful. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes and the project‚Äôs finally getting on track. The response so far is positive, and with the October Next Fest on the horizon we are cautiously optimistic that we might recover from our slow start. On the other hand, I‚Äôm nervous. Putting the Demo out publicly means the game is truly out there in front of players, and that‚Äôs scary. Will people enjoy it? I‚Äôve got that mix of butterflies and excitement in my stomach right now.</p> <p>At the end of the day, we I acted happily and learned from these mistakes instead of quitting. Tailor Simulator is a project straight from my heart and seeing it stumble was really hard.</p> <p>I wanted to share this story not just to vent, but so that other devs can hopefully avoid the pitfalls we fell into. If you‚Äôre preparing your first Steam page or Next Fest demo, maybe my experience can be a cautionary tale. Don‚Äôt rush your timeline, make a great first impression, invest in proper art, and don‚Äôt neglect localization**.** I hear these tips all the time, I know but living through the consequences really hammered it home for me.</p> <p>Anyway, thanks for reading this long post. I‚Äôm looking forward to October with cautious hope. If you have any questions, advice, or similar experiences, I‚Äôd love to hear them. This journey has been humbling, but I‚Äôm excited (and a little terrified) to see what comes next. Also, I put my Steam Page here, if you are curious about my game or any insights you can give me. Wish me luck and good luck to all of you on your own projects too!</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484750/Tailor_Simulator/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484750/Tailor_Simulator/</a></p> <p><strong>‚Äì A slightly wiser dev</strong></p> <p> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thirdluck"> /u/thirdluck </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o19oze/developer_crushed_out_i_have_launched_my_steam/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o19oze/developer_crushed_out_i_have_launched_my_steam/">[comments]</a></span></div>
