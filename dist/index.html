            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I have been developing in (mainly) C and other languages for about a decade now and so seeing some of C&#39;s flaws being fixed by Rust, I was (and still am) curious about the language. So I tried it out on a couple of projects and the biggest issue I had which stopped me from trying and using Rust for years now was mainly the difference in paradigm. In C, I know exactly how to do what, what paradigm to use etc. The style people write C is roughly the same in all codebases and so I find it extremely easy to navigate new codebases. Rust, however, is a more complex language and as such reading Rust code (at least for me) is definitely harder because of its density and the many paradigm it allows for people.</p> <p>I have a hard time understanding what paradigm is used when in Rust, when a struct should receive methods, when those methods should get their own trait, how I should use lifetimes (non-static ones), when should I use macros. I am quite well versed in OOP (Java and Python) and struct-based development (C), but when it comes to FP or Rust&#39;s struct system, I have trouble deciding what goes into a method, what goes into a function, what goes into a trait. Same applies about splitting code into separate files. Do I put code into mod.rs? Do I follow one struct one file? Is a trait a separate file?</p> <p>So tldr, my issue isnt Rust&#39;s syntax or its API, but much rather I feel like it lacks a clear guide on paradigms. Is there such a guide? Or am I misguided in believing that there should be such a guide?</p> <p>Thanks and cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thewrench56"> /u/thewrench56 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p4cbcj/how_to_transition_from_a_c_to_a_rust_mindset/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p4cbcj/how_to_transition_from_a_c_to_a_rust_mindset/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In a project I work on we need to develop a server application that will support transaction processing with extremely low latency (every ms counts - the lower we go the better). The volume of the traffic will also be large. The transaction consist mostly of a lot of networking (HTTP/other calls to third party services) + some light processing, like simple math operations, input/output formatting etc.</p> <p>We are deciding between Rust (most likely with Tokio, but can also consider others) or Golang (with its goroutines). My intuition was that cooperative concurency of Tokio, should be faster than green threads, as it should require less memory shenanigans when switching between execution of futures than green threads when switching between routines. On top of that, I know that for non-concurent case rust is outperforming Go. Nevertheless, when googling the topic myself, I mostly found benchmarks (albeit benchmarks from &quot;randoms on the internet&quot;) suggesting, that Go is either matching or outperforming Rust Tokio.</p> <p>I would love to go with Rust, as till now I was mostly using it for my own small projects, and would like to go for it comercially. Nevertheless, if we cannot gain performance/lose latency with it, we will probably go with Go, as it has been previously used in the org + is simpler for most programmers.</p> <p>Could you let me know what is your experience/thoughts/benchmarks? Can we expect (in average scenario), async Rust/Tokio (or other runtime) to outperform Goroutines?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Matimath"> /u/Matimath </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p4685s/rusttokio_vs_go_for_a_server_side_app_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p4685s/rusttokio_vs_go_for_a_server_side_app_that/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I keep seeing this idea in gamedev spaces that &quot;indie games almost never succeed&quot; and honestly it’s very discouraging (especially for people who want to get into it). Not because game development is easy, but because people take that statement to mean &quot;don’t even try&quot;</p> <p>The real problem is not that indie games can’t/wont do well. We see new breakout indies (from completely new devs) at least once every year. The problem is (usually) that a lot of people: don’t understand what players actually want, make games that are technically fine but creatively lacking, or simply don’t present their idea in a compelling way.</p> <p>Some devs treat their game like its their child and because of that, they refuse to take criticism at face value or change anything that would improve said game, like when a mechanic objectively feels bad to use. They get so used to their own systems that they forget how they feel to new players. The result is games full of cool disconnected ideas that could have been great with a bit of iteration.</p> <p>And thats completely okay, but saying things like &quot;the odds are nigh impossible&quot; ignores that good concepts, good execution, and a want to improve drastically increase your chances.</p> <p>People love unique art, people love new ideas, people love games that say something or offer an experience they can’t get anywhere else.</p> <p>The demand for indie games has never been higher.</p> <p>Do not immediatly call out people on &quot;ego&quot; if they believe they have an amazing idea, hear them out, please. Gamedev is not magic, your best friend might be able to make the best game of all time, you just can&#39;t know before you see it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/r4pturesan"> /u/r4pturesan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p48978/indie_success_is_not_rare_good_design_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p48978/indie_success_is_not_rare_good_design_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I am building an action RPG and my girlfriend was one of the first people to play test it. Problem is she has never seriously played any videogames before in her life. Needless to say she had a very difficult time just learning the controls. Skip a couple of days and I ask a friend to give it a go. This friend had even less experience with games than my girlfriend. I decided to test something out and asked him to play a Link to the Past (After all the people at Nintendo are professional designers right?). He played for about 10 minutes and couldn&#39;t find the secret entrance to the castle, in fact he could hardly control Link. He entered and left Links house twice without opening the chest or picking up the pots. However he expressed that he would like to learn how to play videogames. </p> <p>It got me thinking...Would it be interesting to build a game that teaches game standards step by step to people who might want to get into gaming but have never played before? I was thinking that the game could teach one button at a time one mechanic at a time and really drive each mechanic home. I couldn&#39;t imagine this game being interesting to someone who already plays but is there a market for people that want to get into gaming?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2DDevQuest"> /u/2DDevQuest </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p472z7/is_there_are_market_for_introductory_action_rpg/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p472z7/is_there_are_market_for_introductory_action_rpg/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I suspect he had something to do with this because yesterday that was what happened.</p> <p>Long story short, I fixed it, and it&#39;s better overall than it was before!</p> <p>And since everyone in that thread was pointing out how tests would act as a kind of &#39;saved state&#39; to ensure I don&#39;t do exactly what I did...I have now put tests in.</p> <p>However.....however I still don&#39;t get interfaces or testing so I got an LLM to look at my code and write tests that would pass for the major parts (downloads, updates, accepting back data etc) and am still in the progress of doing this.</p> <p>So thank you very much to all who pointed out why I should test, I hope that it does as you say and stops me making breaking changes! </p> <p>My question is: is getting an LLM agent to write my tests against code that works worthwhile? I am reading them and it looks ok but it&#39;s still not clicked for me.

Can you tell me without looking at ChatGpt is this code wrong? I kind of feel that this code is wrong but I cant explain why and what possible consequences it may give. i know that waitgroup has to be used to count goroutines but here it counts number of elements sent into channel. Idk how to evaluate this</p> <pre><code>func worker(ports chan int, wg *sync.WaitGroup) { for p := range ports { fmt.Println(p) wg.Done() } } func main() { ports := make(chan int, 100) var wg sync.WaitGroup for i := 0; i &lt; cap(ports); i++ { go worker(ports, &amp;wg) } for i := 1; i &lt;= 1024; i++ { wg.Add(1) ports &lt;- i } wg.Wait() close(ports) } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Several-Mess2288"> /u/Several-Mess2288 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1p3rpke/black_hat_go_book_related_question/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1p3rpke/black_hat_go_book_related_question/">[comments]</a></span></div>
