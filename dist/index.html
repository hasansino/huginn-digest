            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What is the current status of the various automatic differentiation crates as of April 2025? More specifically, which crates are reliable enough for use in a research / academic setting, and are currently maintained?</p> <p>More context: I use quite a bit of automatic differentiation and <a href="http://thenumb.at/Autodiff/">differentiable</a> <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/differentiable-programming-a-simple-introduction">programming</a> in my research--it&#39;s useful for a wide variety of areas including optimization, control theory, machine and reinforcement learning, robotics, and more. I mainly use JAX, but have used <a href="https://juliadiff.org/">Julia autodiff packages</a> as well. C++ has some <a href="https://autodiff.github.io/">libraries</a> for this as well, although I haven&#39;t used them as much.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to perform more of my work requiring autodiff in Rust. I&#39;m aware of several autodiff packages that exist (see <a href="https://github.com/elrnv/autodiff">here</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/autodiff/index.html">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/gad">here</a>, <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/fwd_ad">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Janko-dev/rustydiff">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kophy/autodiff">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/al-jshen/reverse">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Rufflewind/revad">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/raskr/rust-autograd">here</a>). However, all of them seem to be very experimental or somewhat unmaintained.</p> <p>What autodiff packages are currently the most reliable for use in a research / academic setting? Are there any packages that I missed in the list above? I&#39;m especially interested in crates that do not require nightly, and crates that are <code>no_std</code> / embedded friendly (although I realize these may not exist yet...)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_jbu"> /u/_jbu </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k124hk/state_of_automatic_differentiation_crates_in_2025/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k124hk/state_of_automatic_differentiation_crates_in_2025/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m genuinely curious. I&#39;ve been using Common Lisp as a hobby language when I was a bachelor student, and now I use Racket for research. I love how lisp languages have a small core, pretty much any operation you may need can be implemented as a macro compiling to a limited set of primitives. Anything you may need in the language can be implemented on top of these operations, you don&#39;t like a feature of the language? Just define your own. During my studies I have also come to like system programming in C (not C++ urgh...), as it is a small language that actually fits in my brain and gives me a ton of freedom, including the one to shoot myself in the foot.</p> <p>For this reason, these past days I&#39;ve been trying to read into Rust. I like the concept of ownership and lifetimes, but that&#39;s about where it ends.</p> <p>The last thing that I&#39;ve learnt, is that to make a value of a certain type being passed with copy semantics it needs to implement a `Copy` trait, otherwise it is passed with `move` semantics. This is cool if I already knew the static type of everything that gets passed to a function, but what if all I have is just a dynamic trait? I assume that the behavior of this would depend on whether the dynamic trait extends Copy or not, but what if the trait doesn&#39;t but the runtime value does?</p> <p>Another feature that to me it took way too much mental gymnastic to comprehend is the size of an enum. How do you know how much space an enum will take? In C this is easy, you just make a tagged union and the size of it is basically self evident (just take the size of its largest value). And yes, I know that Rust has unions, which you can treat exactly the same as C&#39;s. But if this is the case, then why bother at all? There is a ton of abstraction in Rust which I can&#39;t help but think that it shouldn&#39;t belong to the language, things like pattern matching, that weird syntax for returning early with an error, and the list goes on and on. Most of these features could be implemented with a macro (because Rust has macros, right?) but instead they are part of the core language, which means I can&#39;t call a variable `match` for basically no reason if I don&#39;t plan to use that feature at all.</p> <p>I really want to like Rust, I really do. Which is why I&#39;m reaching out to fellow lispers that may have a similar taste in language design to the one that I have to convince me about its qualities that I may be missing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IllMathematician2296"> /u/IllMathematician2296 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k0v0oq/to_lispschemeclojure_programmers_what_made_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k0v0oq/to_lispschemeclojure_programmers_what_made_you/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was recently working on a project that required me to find the Brzozowski derivative of regexes, and I could not find a crate that could both 1) parse the regexes I had, and 2) compute their derivatives. So, I wrote a crate that can do both: <a href="https://github.com/rockysnow7/rzozowski">rzozowski</a>.</p> <p>But let&#39;s zoom out.</p> <h1>What is a Brzozowski derivative?</h1> <p>If we have a regular expression <code>R = &quot;abc&quot;</code> and a character <code>c = &#39;a&#39;</code>, then <code>R.derivative(c) == &quot;bc&quot;</code>. That is, the Brzozowski derivative of a regular expression <em>R</em> with respect to a character <em>c</em> is the part of <em>R</em> that remains after <em>c</em> has been accepted.<br/> For a more complex example, consider that <code>&quot;a*b&quot;.derivative(&#39;a&#39;) == &quot;a*b&quot;</code> - after <code>&quot;a*b&quot;</code> has accepted <code>&#39;a&#39;</code>, it can still accept any number of <code>&#39;a&#39;</code>s. If instead we used <code>&#39;b&#39;</code>, then <code>&quot;a*b&quot;.derivative(&#39;b&#39;) == &quot;&quot;</code>, since nothing can be accepted after <code>&#39;b&#39;</code>.</p> <p>(Note that the above explanation is told from the point of view of a programmer, not a formal language theorist; I am deliberately avoiding certain confusing terminology.)</p> <p>Brzozowski derivatives also allow us to match strings to regexes without using finite automata - you just take the derivative of the regex <em>R</em> for each character in the string <em>S</em>, and if the final derivative of <em>R</em> can accept an empty string, then <em>S</em> matches <em>R</em>. So simple!</p> <h1>Example Usage</h1> <p><em>rzozowski</em> supports more regex features and syntax sugar than other Brzozowski crates. Here is a simple example.</p> <pre><code>use rzozowski::Regex; fn main() { let r = Regex::new(r&quot;\d{3,6}[a-z_]+&quot;).unwrap(); assert!(r.matches(&quot;123abc&quot;)); let der = r.derivative(&#39;1&#39;); assert_eq!(der, Regex::new(r&quot;\d{2,5}[a-z_]+&quot;).unwrap()); } </code></pre> <h1>Comparisons with the standard regex crate</h1> <p><em>rzozowski</em> <strong>parses regexes up to 50x faster</strong> than the standard <em>regex</em> crate.<br/> It <strong>matches simple expressions roughly 2.4x faster</strong> than the standard crate and is roughly <strong>equal in speed with intermediate patterns</strong>.<br/> It is roughly <strong>2x slower at matching complex patterns</strong>.</p> <p>However, <em>rzozowski</em> lacks the feature-fullness of the standard crate. For example, it does not yet support lookaheads, named capture groups, or other such fancy features.</p> <p>More information on all of this can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/rockysnow7/rzozowski">GitHub</a>/<a href="https://crates.io/crates/rzozowski">crates.io</a> page.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I posted about this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wellofcarse.bsky.social/post/3lmvmry2tpc22">here on Bluesky</a>, but I thought some people in this sub might find this helpful as well. This is the story of how I got a Rust job through open source.</p> <p>First I made a list of companies to target. Most I found by searching google jobs for remote Rust jobs. After a couple months I had ~50 small companies on my list (this would have been &gt;100 if I was interested in large companies and crypto companies). Depending on your goals, you may find more prospects.</p> <p>Next I tracked down the Github orgs for each of the companies. Probably about 25-30 of the companies had open source repos with open issues. Many had open sourced parts of their core product, with clear instructions on how to contribute. This was true for both small companies and many larger companies as well.</p> <p>The next step is making contributions. There is a lot to this, and there is a great book called <a href="https://howtoopensource.dev/">How to Open Source</a> that can be helpful if you are new to this. One thing the book points out is that the first step in making contributions is building context. This was the hardest part for me. I read a lot of documentation and code up front. It is also important to reach out on Slack or Discord, or even file issues when you are stuck. You can demonstrate your communication skills while you&#39;re at it.</p> <p>When I opened my PRs, I was careful to not only follow contribution guidelines, but to also match the style of the existing code, leave comments when needed, and add tests. Most companies will be excited to receive high quality code. Often after 2-3 commits someone would reach out to get to know me. This is when I would start a conversation about my employment goals.</p> <p>Many companies have trouble hiring because it is hard to verify experience, aptitude, and communication. The great part of letting your work be your introduction is that you have already done this verification for them. This puts you far ahead of anyone that has submitted an online application.</p> <p>This method worked well enough that I would do it again, and I would recommend it to anyone. I got far more interest through a few contributions than from many applications. In the end, this strategy led to my current full time Rust job.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Historical-Economy92"> /u/Historical-Economy92 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k0mxd9/how_i_got_a_rust_job_through_open_source/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k0mxd9/how_i_got_a_rust_job_through_open_source/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Basically I want to utilize some stuff I&#39;ve done in Go in my app, but am far from a GUI expert and figure I can utilize my basic skills in react + some AI help (uh oh..

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I‚Äôm the founder of <a href="https://www.stormkit.io">Stormkit</a>, a platform for deploying and scaling web apps. Last week, I wrestled with a nasty issue: zombie processes crashing our demo server üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you‚Äôve dealt with process management in Go or Docker, you might find this journey relatable. Here‚Äôs the technical deep dive into how I tracked down and fixed it.</p> <h1>The setup</h1> <p>We have a feature in Stormkit that spins up <strong>Node.js</strong> servers on demand for self-hosted users, using dynamic port assignment to run multiple instances on one server. It‚Äôs built in Go, leveraging <code>os/exec</code> to manage processes. The system had been rock-solid‚Äîno downtime, happy users.</p> <p>Recently, I set up a demo server for server-side <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Svelte</strong> apps. Everything seemed fine until the server started crashing randomly with a Redis <code>Pub/Sub</code> error.</p> <h1>Initial debugging</h1> <p>I upgraded Redis (from 6.x to 7.x), checked logs, and tried reproducing the issue locally‚Äînothing. The crashes were sporadic and elusive. Then, I disabled the Next.js app, and the crashes stopped. I suspected a Next.js-specific issue and dug into its runtime behavior, but nothing stood out.</p> <p>Looking at server metrics, I noticed memory usage spiking before crashes. A quick <code>ps aux</code> revealed a pile of lingering Next.js processes that should‚Äôve been terminated. Our spin-down logic was failing, causing a memory leak that exhausted the server.</p> <h1>Root cause: Go&#39;s os.Process.Kill</h1> <p>The culprit was in our Go code. I used <code>os.Process.Kill</code> to terminate the processes, but it wasn‚Äôt killing child processes spawned by <code>npm</code> (e.g., <code>npm run start</code> spawns <code>next start</code>). This left orphaned processes accumulating.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs a simplified version of the original code:</p> <pre><code>func stopProcess(cmd *exec.Cmd) error { if cmd.Process != nil { return cmd.Process.Kill() } return nil } </code></pre> <p>I reproduced this locally by spawning a Node.js process with children and killing the parent. Sure enough, the children lingered. In Go, <code>os.Process.Kill</code> sends a <code>SIGKILL</code> to the process but doesn‚Äôt handle its child processes.</p> <h1>Fix attempt: Process groups</h1> <p>To kill child processes, I modified the code to use process groups. By setting a process group ID (PGID) with <code>syscall.SysProcAttr</code>, I could send signals to the entire group. Here‚Äôs the updated code (simplified):</p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;log&quot; &quot;os/exec&quot; &quot;syscall&quot; ) func startProcess() (*exec.Cmd, error) { cmd := exec.Command(&quot;npm&quot;, &quot;run&quot; &quot;start&quot;) cmd.SysProcAttr = &amp;syscall.SysProcAttr{Setpgid: true} // Assign PGID if err := cmd.Start(); err != nil { return nil, err } return cmd, nil } func stopProcess(cmd *exec.Cmd) error { if cmd.Process == nil { return nil } // Send SIGTERM to the process group pgid, err := syscall.Getpgid(cmd.Process.Pid) if err != nil { return err } return syscall.Kill(-pgid, syscall.SIGTERM) // Negative PGID targets group } </code></pre> <p>This worked locally: killing the parent also terminated the children. I deployed an alpha version to our remote server, expecting victory. But <code>ps aux</code> showed <code>&lt;defunct&gt;</code> next to the processes ‚Äî zombie processes! üß†</p> <h1>Zombie processes 101</h1> <p>In Linux, a zombie process occurs when a child process terminates, but its parent doesn‚Äôt collect its exit status (via wait or waitpid). The process stays in the process table, marked &lt;defunct&gt;. Zombies are harmless in small numbers but can exhaust the process table when accumulates, preventing new processes from starting.</p> <p>Locally, my Go binary was reaping processes fine. Remotely, zombies persisted. The key difference? The remote server ran Stormkit in a Docker container.</p> <h1>Docker‚Äôs zombie problem</h1> <p>Docker assigns PID 1 to the container‚Äôs entrypoint (our Go binary in this case). In Linux, PID 1 (init/systemd) is responsible for adopting orphaned processes and reaping its own zombie children, including former orphans it has adopted. If PID 1 doesn‚Äôt handle SIGCHLD signals and call wait, zombies accumulate. Our Go program wasn‚Äôt designed to act as an init system, so it ignored orphaned processes.</p> <h1>The solution: Tini</h1> <p>After investigating a bit more, I found out that reaping zombie processes is a long-standing problem with docker - so there were already solutions in the market. Finally I found <strong>Tini</strong>, a lightweight init system designed for containers. Tini runs as PID 1, properly reaping zombies by handling SIGCHLD and wait for all processes. I updated our Dockerfile:</p> <pre><code>ENTRYPOINT [&quot;/usr/bin/tini&quot;, &quot;--&quot;] CMD [&quot;/app/stormkit&quot;] </code></pre> <p>Alternatively, I could‚Äôve used Docker‚Äôs --init flag, which adds Tini automatically.</p> <p>After deploying with Tini, <code>ps aux</code> was clean ‚Äî no zombies! üéâ The server stabilized, and the Redis errors vanished as they were a side effect of resource exhaustion.</p> <h1>Takeaways</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Go process management</strong>: <code>os.Process.Kill</code> doesn‚Äôt handle child processes. Use process groups or proper signal handling for clean termination.</li> <li><strong>Docker PID 1</strong>: If your app runs as PID 1, it needs to reap zombies or delegate to an init system like Tini.</li> <li><strong>Debugging tip</strong>: Always check ps aux for &lt;defunct&gt; processes when dealing with crashes.</li> <li><strong>Root cause matters</strong>: The Redis error was a red herring ‚Äî memory exhaustion from zombies was the real issue.</li> </ul> <p>This was a very educative process for me, so I thought sharing it with the rest of the community. I hope you enjoyed it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/svedova"> /u/svedova </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0knpu/slaying_zombie_processes_in_a_go_docker_setup_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0knpu/slaying_zombie_processes_in_a_go_docker_setup_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am working on a project and planning to open source a framework it is built on. Think of gRPC: some network communication in between, some tools for code generating stubs and interfaces, and the user&#39;s responsibility is to implement servers-side interface. But that does not really matter for my question.</p> <p>My applications are instrumented with prometheus metrics all over the place, there are metrics in the framework part too. I am thinking now what should I do with those metrics in the framework part when I separate it and release as a library. There are probably 3 options:</p> <ul> <li>Leave prom metrics as is. Users will get some instrumentation out of the box. But this is not abstract enough, users might want to use another metrics collector. Plus an extra dependency in go.mod. And if you declare prometheus metrics but dont run a scrapper there is nothing bad in it, right?</li> <li>Try to refactor the framework to add middlewares (similar to gRPC middleware). This is cleaner. Some metrics middlewares can be provided in separate packages (like <a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tree/main/providers/prometheus">https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware/tree/main/providers/prometheus</a>). The downside is that those middlewares will not have enough access to the framework internals and can only instrument some simple counters and timers around methods execution.</li> <li>Add some abstract metric collector. The framework would be deeply instrumented, but the exact metric collection system is up to the user. I have found some examples: <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/tally">https://github.com/uber-go/tally</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-metrics">https://github.com/hashicorp/go-metrics</a>. But I have not found anything which looks like an industry standard to me, all those examples look like bespoke tools used mostly inside respective companies. And I dont like the fact that those libraries abstract away details of particular collector implementation (like naming convention, lables/tags conversion, prohibited symbols, data types, etc).</li> </ul> <p>What should I do?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stas_spiridonov"> /u/stas_spiridonov </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0i5zh/best_practices_for_instrumenting_an_open_source/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0i5zh/best_practices_for_instrumenting_an_open_source/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I‚Äôve been actively learning Go for the past 3-4 months, but one topic that I still can‚Äôt <strong>wrap</strong> my head around is error handling.</p> <p>I am familiar with ‚Äúidiomatic‚Äù error handling, introduced in go 1.13, namely, this resource: </p> <p>- <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors">https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors</a> </p> <p>But I feel like it doesn‚Äôt solve my problem.</p> <p>Suppose you‚Äôre creating an HTTP server. During some request, deep down in the logic an error occurs. You propagate the error with <code>fmt.Errorf()</code>, potentially wrapping it several times. Then, in HTTP server, you might have some middleware, that logs the error.</p> <p>Here are my questions:</p> <ol> <li>When I wrap the error, I manually type the error message in the <code>fmt.Errorf()</code> call. Then, when I inspect the logs of my HTTP server, I see the error message, and I have to search for that particular error string in my codebase. This feels wrong. I‚Äôd rather have a file name and line number, or at least a function name. How do you solve this issue?</li> <li>When I wrap the error with <code>fmt.Errorf()</code>, I don‚Äôt always have an insightful text message. Sometimes it‚Äôs just <code>‚Äúerror searching for user in database‚Äù</code> or <code>‚Äúerror in findMostRecentUser()‚Äù</code>. This text only serves the purpose of a stacktrace. Doing it manually also feels wrong. Do you do the same?</li> <li>I have from c++, where I used the <code>backward</code> library for collecting stacktraces (<a href="https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp">https://github.com/bombela/backward-cpp</a>). What is your opinion on similar libraries in go?</li> </ol> <p>- <a href="https://github.com/pkg/errors">https://github.com/pkg/errors</a> (seems unmaintained these days)</p> <p>- <a href="https://github.com/rotisserie/eris">https://github.com/rotisserie/eris</a></p> <p>- <a href="https://github.com/go-errors/errors">https://github.com/go-errors/errors</a></p> <p>- <a href="https://github.com/palantir/stacktrace">https://github.com/palantir/stacktrace</a></p> <p>They do not seem very popular. Do you use them? If not, why?</p> <ol> <li>Can you give me examples of some good golang open source microservice projects?</li> </ol> <p>I am also familiar with structured logging and that it&#39;s able to provide source file information, but it&#39;s only done for <code>slog.Error()</code> calls. I&#39;d like to have the full stacktrace to be able to understand the exact path of the execution.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/suchusername_"> /u/suchusername_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0f4qp/handling_errors_in_large_projects_how_do_you_do_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1k0f4qp/handling_errors_in_large_projects_how_do_you_do_it/">[comments]</a></span></div>
