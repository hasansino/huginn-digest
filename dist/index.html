            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For web services.</p> <p>We have an business entity, can be anything really. Orders, payments, you name it. This aggregate has sub entities. Basically entities that belong to it and wouldn&#39;t really exist without it. Let&#39;s think of this whole thing as DDD aggregates, but don&#39;t constraint yourself to this definition. Think Go.</p> <p>On the database side, this aggregate saves data in multiple tables. </p> <p>Now my question is:</p> <p>Where do you personally place business logic? To create the aggregate root and its subentities, there are a bunch of business rules to follow. E.g. the entity has a type, and depending on the type you need to follow specific rules.</p> <p>Do you:</p> <ol> <li><p>Place all business rules in the entity struct (as methods) and have minimal business rules in the application service (just delegate tasks and coordinate aggregates). And at the end store the whole aggregate in memory using a single entity repo.</p></li> <li><p>Or have a Entity service, which manipulates the Entity struct, where the entity struct has just minimal methods and most business rules are in the service? And where you can call multiple repos, for the entity and sub entities, all within a transaction?</p></li> </ol> <p>I feel like 2 is more Go like. But it&#39;s not as DDD.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I&#39;ve ran into a problem I think Rust&#39;s async is a good fit for. I&#39;ve used Rust a decent amount but haven&#39;t had a need for async until now. I&#39;d like to have a really solid clean design for this application, so I&#39;m looking for guidance so I don&#39;t end up hacking something together.</p> <p>For context, I am making a Windows app to remap mouse right-click to keyboard &quot;c&quot; in a way that emulates automatic key repetition. So with this pogram running, if you have Notepad open and you hold right click, it&#39;ll type &quot;c&quot;, then after a short delay it&#39;ll spam &quot;ccccccc&quot; until you release right click, just like if you held the key down on your keyboard.</p> <p>I&#39;ve figured out all the Windows API calls I need to make to capture mouse input and synthesize keyboard input, so that&#39;s not my question. My question is on getting the timing aspect of this to work correctly and efficiently.</p> <p>(Yes, this is a Windows-specific application, if that matters.)</p> <p>I&#39;m imagining the key repeat functionality should live in its own thread. This thread will have some sort of mpsc::Receiver it uses to know when keys are pressed or released. A different part of this program sends RClickDown or RClickUp messages to this channel whenever the user presses or releases right click. It is this thread&#39;s responsibility to call two functions I&#39;ve written, <code>keydown()</code> and <code>keyup()</code>, at the appropriate time.</p> <p>Specifically, when the thread sees an RClickDown message, it calls <code>keydown()</code>. Then, it waits for 250 ms, and then repeatedly calls <code>keydown()</code> every 31 ms. This goes on forever, but at any point if the thread sees an RClickUp message, the thread immediately cancels the timer and calls <code>keyup()</code>. The thread then sits idle, waiting for the next RClickDown message.</p> <p>I made a diagram of this behavior:</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/n0ta7wbuiz0f1.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f88cec6c4703aeadf09b5368dcfa0b46bae0dd25">https://preview.redd.it/n0ta7wbuiz0f1.png?width=1770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f88cec6c4703aeadf09b5368dcfa0b46bae0dd25</a></p> <p>My understanding is Rust async is great for cancel-able concurrent operations like this. I really do not want a heavy, multi-threaded executor for this task as it would be wasteful. I want this program to be very lightweight.</p> <p>So, how would you approach this? Would you bring in something like <code>tokio</code> or <code>smol</code>? Should I use some kind of <code>select</code> macro? Or <code>FuturesUnordered</code>?</p> <p>The program will eventually have more complex functionality, but I want to nail the fundamentals first.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/a_mighty_burger"> /u/a_mighty_burger </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1knfk29/cancelable_timer_whats_the_best_tool_in_the_async/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1knfk29/cancelable_timer_whats_the_best_tool_in_the_async/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Is there any other alternatives?</p> <p>I also came across tiny-skia but it doesnt support text rendering unfortunately.</p> <p>I saw that most of the C wayland apps use cairo to render text, so there is something like that in Rust?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0xorang3"> /u/0xorang3 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1knde88/pure_rust_library_to_draw_texts_and_images_on_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1knde88/pure_rust_library_to_draw_texts_and_images_on_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I‚Äôm a web developer with over <strong>10 years of professional</strong> experience and another <strong>10 as a hobbyist</strong>, and recently I decided to try using a game engine. I chose Godot over Unity or Unreal, and I‚Äôve been using it for <strong>half a year</strong> now.</p> <p>I want to share my reasons and experience while the memory is still fresh. Hopefully, it‚Äôll be useful to some of you.</p> <h1>My Background</h1> <p>It all started as a hobby when I was 15. I was making mostly games for fun, like ping-pong on <strong>Turbo Pascal</strong> or a 3D analog of Bomber Man on <strong>Delphi</strong>. I even made some electronic toys on microcontrollers which required some <strong>C++</strong> programming.</p> <p>Later, when I joined a big outsourcing company, I became a <strong>Java</strong> back-end developer, and then a <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> front-end developer, which makes me a full-stack developer capable of creating complete web applications on my own. And I did.</p> <p>At some point, I decided to make a web application to help me with my chores, and I used <strong>AWS</strong> for all the infrastructure. The application works fine, but as a commercial product, it is a total failure. Not a single paid user ever. So I abandoned it, but didn‚Äôt turn it off because I still use it myself.</p> <p>I mention this experience because it had a great impact on my decision about which game engine to use.</p> <h1>First Attempt</h1> <p>So I decided to make a game, and instead of using a game engine, I used <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>three.js</strong>... and even <strong>React Native</strong>, since I was making a mobile game.</p> <p>This was the biggest mistake of all. I made it because I was impatient. I wanted to start right away and used the tools I was already familiar with, so I wouldn&#39;t waste time learning new ones. I didn‚Äôt know how wrong I was at the time.</p> <p>Because I knew the tools I was using, the game development itself was fine. But the real pain point was performance. Too much time was burned on optimization attempts. At some point, I stopped enjoying the process and abandoned the game too. That was the point where I decided I was going to make the next game using a game engine.</p> <p>Having experience making games using different tools made me realize that no matter what engine I chose, it would likely have no impact on the final game. Most of the differences between them are things I wouldn‚Äôt use as a solo dev. So I needed to choose the one I would gain the most development comfort from.</p> <h1>Making a choice</h1> <p>As you can see from my experience, I wasn‚Äôt afraid of learning a new programming language. I already knew Java (which is like a brother to C#), so I was seriously considering <strong>Unity</strong>.</p> <p>In my career, I always chose what to learn next, based on my sense of how useful a technology was. I wasn‚Äôt afraid to try something fresh if I saw potential in it, and I refused to learn something that looked overhyped or dying. Learning <strong>Unity</strong> also promised that I would know another useful language, and if I wanted to find a game dev job, there would be plenty of opportunities with <strong>Unity</strong>. And <strong>Godot</strong>, with its limited C# support, was looking less promising.</p> <h1>So why, then, did I choose Godot?</h1> <p>This is where all my previous experience and the lessons I learned from using different tools for work and hobbies come into play.</p> <p><strong>GDScript</strong></p> <p>Most tools are too universal, and the most comfortable ones are those more specific to the task you are about to perform. Because of that, If you‚Äôre making, say, a specific type of app, then you should find or make yourself a framework tailored for it. That way, you‚Äôll be able to build them with comfort.</p> <p>That‚Äôs why game devs prefer using game engines over pure C# or C++. And that‚Äôs also why I prefer GDScript over C#. It is more specific to the task.</p> <p><strong>Open Source</strong></p> <p>Throughout my dev career, I‚Äôve preferred open source tools. Not just because they‚Äôre free (though that too), but because they‚Äôre made by the community for the community.</p> <p>Tools like Unity and Unreal are made by commercial companies whose only reason to exist is to <strong>make more money</strong>. That makes them unpredictable. Today they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood,‚Äù and tomorrow they‚Äôre ‚Äúevil‚Äù (hello, Google).</p> <p>I worked for a couple of companies whose politics changed dramatically, just because of the mood change of current stakeholders. One day, you‚Äôre a valuable employee, part of a <strong>family</strong>. The next, you‚Äôre a small cog in a well-oiled <strong>machine</strong>, easily replaceable.</p> <p>I was also a client of companies that were nurturing me, giving me a personal manager to keep me around. And when a war started in a neighboring country (not even mine), they decided to close my accounts because I belonged to a higher-risk zone now.</p> <p>All this happens because their actions are dictated by future profit.<br/> So yeah, I prefer tools that don‚Äôt have any power over me.</p> <p><strong>Freedom</strong></p> <p>Remember that web app I built with AWS infrastructure? After a year of silence, AWS started reminding me of its existence. They revoked certificates because they no longer support them, and ended support for some versions because new ones are out. They kept urging me to take action. But a year had passed since I touched the infrastructure, I had forgotten everything, and I was afraid that if I made a change now, it could take me weeks just to ensure the prod deploy goes smoothly with all the testing and stuff. And yeah, they never forget to charge me every month, even if I forget the app exists.</p> <p>Something like this has already happened to one of my apps before. When I was using Heroku, they ended up shutting it down for good.</p> <p>As a solo dev with no team behind me to support all the apps I create, I want to build things that just work and don‚Äôt need my attention later. And Unity already taught us that it can change the rules of the game whenever it wants.</p> <p>My friend told me, ‚ÄúBut they canceled the fees. It‚Äôs all fine now.‚Äù<br/> Yes, but for how long? They already showed their intention, and we all saw it. Canceling it now doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything for the future.</p> <p>As a solo dev, I want to be free from these legal issues. I don‚Äôt want to suddenly owe something to someone one day. I want to focus on the new stuff I‚Äôm building, not on surprise fees for old things I‚Äôve already forgotten about.</p> <h1>So how did it go?</h1> <p>Well, these were the reasons I made my choice. But I still didn‚Äôt know what it would actually look like to use the new tool and the new programming language.</p> <p>I had opened Unity once or twice before, out of curiosity. I wanted to prototype a game and see how it looked, just to try making something with a real game engine. But all the new terminology, like scene, prefab, and so on, was confusing to me back then. I wasn‚Äôt able to do much without diving in deep.</p> <p>But with Godot, the first steps were easy. The terminology was still new to me, but it somehow felt more intuitive, considering my web dev experience.</p> <p><strong>The Documentation:</strong></p> <p>The documentation is great. It explains things clearly, guides you through the basics, and shows how to build a game from start to finish.</p> <p>It also covers more complex concepts. It doesn‚Äôt just stop at listing objects, their properties, and functions like most docs do. Instead, you get explanations about why and how things work. For example, here is the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_lightmapgi.html">LightmapGI</a> doc, and here is the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/global_illumination/using_lightmap_gi.html">Using Lightmap global illumination</a> guide that explains how lightmaps work.</p> <p>It took me exactly <strong>10 days</strong> to <strong>learn</strong> the basics, <strong>make</strong>, and <strong>release</strong> my first Godot game on Play Store. And this was only possible thanks to the great documentation, which explained the basics, how things work, and how they‚Äôre intended to be used.</p> <p><strong>GDScript:</strong></p> <p>I use VSCode with Godot, just because it is hard for me to teach my hands new hotkeys, so can&#39;t say much about <strong>embedded editor</strong>. It was not comfortable for me to use, can&#39;t explain why. It is ok, just not as comfortable as the one I use. I didn‚Äôt really have much experience with it anyway. But Godot&#39;s <strong>external editors support</strong> is very good, at least for VSCode.</p> <p>GDScript is Python-inspired, and I&#39;ve never used Python before, so expected a learning curve, but there wasn&#39;t any. I just <strong>started using it right away</strong>, without even opening the GDScript docs. What was in the Godot documentation was pretty much enough.</p> <p><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#memory-management">No GC</a>(Garbage Collector) is a great thing for game dev. One of the performance issues I had with JS was an overwhelmed GC, and I had to be very careful not to trigger GC events in my code. I don‚Äôt know how C# devs on Unity deal with GC, but with GDScript, the absence of it makes <strong>one less thing to worry about</strong>.</p> <p>GDScript is <strong>considered slow</strong>, so you‚Äôre supposed to reduce its use in heavy algorithms. For me, this <strong>hasn‚Äôt been an issue</strong> so far. Solo dev means simple games. Simple games mean simple algorithms. But I started making an automation game recently, so I expect to hit the GDScript performance wall soon. I know there‚Äôs a way to use C++ or C# for heavy parts, so I‚Äôll see about that soon.</p> <p>I like to abstract things so my app can be extended when needed, and the lack of <strong>interfaces</strong> in GDScript makes that less comfortable. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem yet though, because I doubt all my habits when it comes to game development. All the patterns and principles I use are from my web dev experience, and I believe there are better alternatives for game dev that I‚Äôm yet to learn.</p> <p><strong>Signals:</strong></p> <p>I have mixed feelings about signals. On one hand, they‚Äôre a great way to <strong>connect some code</strong>. On the other, it‚Äôs <strong>hard to track</strong> what calls what when you rely on them heavily. I know there‚Äôs an addon for signal visualization. Maybe it helps, maybe it‚Äôs just a toy, I don‚Äôt know.</p> <p>From my point of view, signals are overhyped. Most of the time, you have alternatives, so it‚Äôs fine to have another tool on your belt, but I wouldn‚Äôt say you need them for comfortable development. It‚Äôs just too easy to lose track of all the connections.</p> <p>I came up with my own node-based solution that uses one global signal under the hood. You hook up different events to buttons or action nodes by just dropping a node as a child. Still not perfect, but at least I can read all my event connections and actions from the node tree.</p> <p><strong>Nodes:</strong></p> <p>I am <strong>in love</strong> with nodes!</p> <p>Since I discovered that I don‚Äôt need inheritance to reuse logic, that I can just write a generic script that enhances its parent, give it a class name, and drop it into other nodes as a child, my code has become much cleaner, and I‚Äôve started to iterate on new features much faster.</p> <p><strong>UI / Control nodes:</strong>.</p> <p>After many years with HTML/CSS/JS in my hands, Godot&#39;s UI system was torture for me. I think I‚Äôve made peace with it and accepted its limitations, so I don‚Äôt complain about it anymore. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning my first impression.</p> <p>I was very confused when I tried to make my first UI. I don‚Äôt know if other engines are any better. I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs bad, it&#39;s ok. I just think I haven‚Äôt fully adapted to it yet.</p> <p><strong>Exports:</strong></p> <p>Android, Web, Windows ‚Äì easy-peasy. No complaints there, everything went <strong>smoothly</strong>.</p> <p><strong>AI help:</strong></p> <p>I think it&#39;s worth mentioning that if you heavily rely on AI to write your code, you shouldn&#39;t expect much help with Godot. More often than not, the answers and solutions are bad. Looks like there&#39;s not enough information about Godot in their training yet. Unity should be more familiar to them.</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>With my background and already knowing Java (ready to switch to C#), I should have chosen Unity or even Unreal. However, my past mistakes and struggles made me prioritize freedom, more predictable future, and the ability to let my projects go without having to take them down.</p> <p>Not looking for a game dev job also played a role in my preference for these engines. Also as a solo dev, it would probably never be a problem for me that another engine does something better.</p> <p>So, I chose Godot, and I‚Äôm having a great time using it.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong><br/> Started as a hobby dev, became a full-stack web developer. Tried building a game without an engine (JS + Three.js + React Native), but performance and complexity killed the fun. Switched to Godot over Unity/Unreal because of my preference for open-source, dev freedom, and simpler tooling. GDScript is intuitive, Godot‚Äôs docs are great, exports are smooth. Unity‚Äôs commercial risks and shifting policies were a dealbreaker for me as a solo dev.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Warm_Condition6830"> /u/Warm_Condition6830 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kn5qpg/why_i_chose_godot_after_20_years_in_dev_longread/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kn5qpg/why_i_chose_godot_after_20_years_in_dev_longread/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm talking about differentiating between physical and magical damage.</p> <p>Then within those differentiating further, like blunt vs blade. </p> <p>Or in magic systems you get all the elemental damages.</p> <p>Then for each damage type you make damage resistances.</p> <p>It‚Äôs incredibly common in so many different games.</p> <p>But is that actually fun?</p> <p>You just kinda mess with a difficulty curve, some bosses will randomly be harder for the player because he happened to have wrong type stats.</p> <p>Some will be way easier because he happened to have good stats.</p> <p>But it‚Äôs just random, the player won‚Äôt change his builds for that. Some things are just too easy and some are too hard. That‚Äôs it.</p> <p>OR you do push the values hard enough where the player MUST change their build. But is that fun? Is that meaningful player driven decisions and moment to moment combat, or is it an arbitrary rock paper scissors system for stats that literally has zero value?</p> <p>My thinking is, it‚Äôs way better to add variety where enemies can be designed to be easier against certain type of gameplay. Like an enemy can be designed to be a lot easier or harder to kill with ranged weapons through mechanics, not stats. </p> <p>So if you manage to kill something with a blade that is designed to be hard with a blade - that‚Äôs a mechanical accomplishment. Unlike looking for a different blade that has different stats for specific enemy, which is just a time sink.</p> <p>If you can‚Äôt kill it with your weapon of choice and change it, you actually get different mechanical gameplay. </p> <p>Is there any benefit to actually have wide range of damage types and resistances?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AwkwardWillow5159"> /u/AwkwardWillow5159 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kn0m07/are_damage_types_actually_fun/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kn0m07/are_damage_types_actually_fun/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve been teaching a 2D/3D game dev class) for CS students for quite a long time using C++. Next fall I‚Äôm seriously thinking about completely revamping the course in terms of the dev environment and framework ( and possibly language ) . For sure , I am not going to use a big engine like unity or UE. I teach fundamentals concepts that can be transferred to any engine or scratch development project. I have a personal interest in rust. So one of my candidates is rust / Bevy. The C++ argument is easy sell but most students coming to my class don‚Äôt know C++ either and 99% of them do not go into the game industry. Last time I checked , rust was a language that 83% of all developers are interested in learning .. </p> <p>Any thoughts on Rust for teaching ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/964racer"> /u/964racer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kndvsz/should_i_switch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kndvsz/should_i_switch/">[comments]</a></span></div>
