There are some small differences such as Slim striping all whitespace by default, whereas Haml will keep the newlines. EGO keeps it all, newlines, tabs, and spaces by default.</p> <p><em>GoHT</em> is a Go code generation tool which converts template code into Go code that can then be called later to generate HTML and other text content.</p> <p>I&#39;ve still got work to do to update the plugins (JetBrains and VSCode) and also the website to include support for these new forms of templates. With the v0.7.0 version of the <em>GoHT</em> LSP installed, the current version of both plugins will give mostly correct error and info feedback but the syntax highlighting will be all over the place.</p> <p><strong>Repo</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/stackus/goht">GitHub</a> <strong>Readme</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/stackus/goht/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a> <strong>Changelog</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/stackus/goht/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/stackus"> /u/stackus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kb5xmk/goht_now_with_slim_ego_templates_still_supports/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kb5xmk/goht_now_with_slim_ego_templates_still_supports/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I want to add <code>types</code> and <code>statuses</code> so that I can filter its using array</p> <pre><code>package requests import ( &quot;ft_tools/models&quot; validation &quot;github.com/go-ozzo/ozzo-validation/v4&quot; &quot;github.com/labstack/echo/v4&quot; &quot;gorm.io/gorm&quot; ) type GetManyLinkRequest struct { PaginationRequest Statuses []string `json:&quot;statuses&quot; validate:&quot;omitempty&quot; default:&quot;&quot;` Types []string `json:&quot;types&quot; validate:&quot;omitempty&quot; default:&quot;&quot;` } func (g *GetManyLinkRequest) Validate() error { err := g.PaginationRequest.Validate() if err != nil { return err } return validation.ValidateStruct(g, validation.Field(&amp;g.Statuses, validation.Each(validation.In( string(models.LinkStatusNew), string(models.LinkStatusProcessing), string(models.LinkStatusProcessed), string(models.LinkStatusError), ))), validation.Field(&amp;g.Types, validation.Each(validation.In( string(models.LinkTypePrivate), string(models.LinkTypePublic), string(models.LinkTypeDie), ))), ) } func (g *GetManyLinkRequest) BakePagination(db *gorm.DB) *gorm.DB { db = g.PaginationRequest.BakePagination(db) if len(g.Statuses) &gt; 0 { db = db.Where(&quot;status IN ?&quot;, g.Statuses) } if len(g.Types) &gt; 0 { db = db.Where(&quot;type IN ?&quot;, g.Types) } return db } func NewGetManyLinkRequest(context echo.Context, allowedSortFields []string, allowedSearchFields []string) (*GetManyLinkRequest, error) { paginationReq, err := NewPaginationRequest(context, allowedSortFields, allowedSearchFields) if err != nil { return nil, err } getManyLinkRequest := &amp;GetManyLinkRequest{ PaginationRequest: *paginationReq, } if err := context.Bind(getManyLinkRequest); err != nil { return nil, err } if err := getManyLinkRequest.Validate(); err != nil { return nil, err } return getManyLinkRequest, nil } </code></pre> <p>And now it is the implementation on handler. Just pass the list of allow search and sort and context and you good to go</p> <pre><code>func (h *LinkHandler) GetAllLinks(c echo.Context) error { linkRepository := repositories.NewLinkRepository(h.server.DB) pgRequest, err := requests.NewGetManyLinkRequest(c, []string{&quot;id&quot;, &quot;created_at&quot;}, []string{&quot;url&quot;, &quot;title&quot;}) if err != nil { return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusBadRequest, err.Error()) } links, err := linkRepository.GetAll(pgRequest) if err != nil { return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusInternalServerError, err.Error()) } totals, err := linkRepository.Count() if err != nil { return echo.NewHTTPError(http.StatusInternalServerError, err.Error()) } res := response.NewPaginationResponse(links, pgRequest.Limit, pgRequest.Page, totals) return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, res) } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BinVio"> /u/BinVio </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kafmhv/my_dynamic_pagination_solution_what_is_the_catch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kafmhv/my_dynamic_pagination_solution_what_is_the_catch/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I‚Äôm excited to share that I‚Äôve just finished the core functionality of Chalk-plus, a Rust port of the popular chalk.js library.</p> <p>Right now, it‚Äôs nothing too fancy ‚Äî just clean, chainable terminal text styling ‚Äî but building it was a great learning experience. I know there are tons of similar libraries out there, but I mainly built this one as my first-ever Rust library project. I wanted to learn the full process, and honestly? It was really fun. I‚Äôm definitely planning to port more libraries from JavaScript to Rust in the future.</p> <p>This small project also gave me a deeper appreciation for how structured and efficient Rust can be, even for something simple.</p> <p>If you‚Äôre new to Rust and looking for a way to get hands-on, I highly recommend trying something like this. It might sound clich√© to ‚Äújust build something,‚Äù but porting an existing library really teaches you a lot ‚Äî both about the language and about software architecture.</p> <p>Also, pro tip: check if your crate name is available on crates.io before you start.

However, one thing doesn&#39;t sit right with me: using <code>const</code>s or <code>use EnumName::*</code> completely breaks the guarantees the <code>match</code> provides</p> <h1>The issue</h1> <p>Consider the following code:</p> <pre><code>enum ReallyLongEnumName { A(i32), B(f32), C, D, } const FORTY_TWO: i32 = 42; fn do_something(value: ReallyLongEnumName) { use ReallyLongEnumName::*; match value { A(FORTY_TWO) =&gt; println!(&quot;Life!&quot;), A(i) =&gt; println!(&quot;Integer {i}&quot;), B(f) =&gt; println!(&quot;Float {f}&quot;), C =&gt; println!(&quot;300000 km/s&quot;), D =&gt; println!(&quot;Not special&quot;), } } </code></pre> <p>Currently, this code will have a logic error if you either</p> <ol> <li>Remove the <code>FORTY_TWO</code> constant or</li> <li>Remove either <code>C</code> or <code>D</code> variant of the <code>ReallyLongEnumName</code></li> </ol> <p>Both of those are entirely within the realm of possibility. Some rustaceans say to avoid <code>use Enum::*</code>, but the issue still remains when using constants.</p> <h1>My proposal</h1> <p>Use the existing <code>name @ pattern</code> syntax for wildcard matches. The pattern <code>other</code> becomes <code>other @ _</code>. This way, the <code>do_something</code> function would be written like this:</p> <pre><code>fn better_something(value: ReallyLongEnumName) { use ReallyLongEnumName::*; match value { A(FORTY_TWO) =&gt; println!(&quot;Life!&quot;), A(i @ _) =&gt; println!(&quot;Integer {i}&quot;), B(f @ _) =&gt; println!(&quot;Float {f}&quot;), C =&gt; println!(&quot;300000 km/s&quot;), D =&gt; println!(&quot;Deleting the D variant now will throw a compiler error&quot;), } } </code></pre> <p>(Currently, this code throws a compiler error: <code>match bindings cannot shadow unit variants</code>, which makes sense with the existing pattern system)</p> <p>With this solution, if <code>FORTY_TWO</code> is removed, the pattern <code>A(FORTY_TWO)</code> will throw a compiler error, instead of silently matching all integers with the <code>FORTY_TWO</code> wildcard. Same goes for removing an enum variant: <code>D =&gt; ...</code> doesn&#39;t become a dead branch, but instead throws a compiler error, as <code>D</code> is not considered a wildcard on its own.</p> <p>Is this solution verbose? Yes, but rust isn&#39;t exactly known for being a concise language anyway.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>tldr...I&#39;m looking to write a series of methods that act on an underlying map type, but that underlying map type may be wrapped in several additional layers of HashMaps. I&#39;m trying to setup the architecture in a recursive way for maintainability, but I keep running into a <code>conflicting implementations of trait &#39;NestedMap&#39; for type</code> error. </p> <p>Base types are: <code>BTreeMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> and <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>... for example, <code>BTreeMap&lt;Date, Decimal&gt;</code> is the most common base map we use and that carries economic time series data like cash flows.</p> <p>Example nested types would be: <code>HashMap&lt;String, HashMap&lt;String, BTreeMap&lt;Date, Decimal&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>HashMap&lt;String, HashMap&lt;String, f64&gt;&gt;</code>. In the first example, the <code>BTreeMap&lt;Date, Decimal&gt;</code> is the base map and there are two layers of hash map around that. In the second example, the <code>HashMap&lt;String, f64&gt;</code> is the base map. </p> <p>Example methods: <code>map1.union_with(map2, |a, b| *a += b)</code>... or ... <code>map1.apply_to_all_values(func)</code></p> <p>We use these structures a lot, so I&#39;m hoping to write trait methods that will provide a more readable interface for them. I&#39;m also hoping to write these methods in such a way that I can lean on a recursive architecture so I don&#39;t need to write boiler plate for each level of nesting and each combination of types. I&#39;m really hoping to avoid writing a new struct wrapper, or something like. </p> <hr/> <p>My ideas so far: </p> <p>Define what a leaf can be with a Leaf trait...</p> <pre><code>pub trait Leaf: Clone {} impl Leaf for i32 {} impl Leaf for u32 {} impl Leaf for i64 {} impl Leaf for u64 {} impl Leaf for f32 {} impl Leaf for f64 {} impl Leaf for String {} impl Leaf for bool {} impl Leaf for Decimal {} </code></pre> <p>Write NestedMap.... This isn&#39;t the full implementation, but this is the gist of it and I&#39;ve written this a dozen different ways, but I always end up with the same problem. I eventually get a<code>...conflicting implementations of trait &#39;NestedMap&#39; for type...</code>error. Is this idea impossible? I really don&#39;t want to make a special structure, or a wrapper or anything like that... but hopefully someone has an idea. </p> <pre><code>pub trait NestedMap { type InnermostValue: Clone; type KeyPath; /// Recursively merges nested maps fn union_nested_with&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, other: Self, merge_fn: F) where Self: Sized, F: Fn(&amp;mut Self::InnermostValue, Self::InnermostValue) + Clone; fn union_nested_add(&amp;mut self, other: Self) -&gt; &amp;mut Self where Self::InnermostValue: AddAssign + Clone, Self: Sized, { self.union_nested_with(other, |a, b| *a += b); self } } // Implementation for HashMap with leaf values impl&lt;K, V&gt; NestedMap for HashMap&lt;K, V&gt; where K: Clone + Eq + Hash, V: Leaf, { type InnermostValue = V; type KeyPath = K; fn union_nested_with&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, other: Self, merge_fn: F) where F: Fn(&amp;mut Self::InnermostValue, Self::InnermostValue) + Clone, { self.union_with(other, merge_fn); } } impl&lt;K, V&gt; NestedMap for BTreeMap&lt;K, V&gt; where K: Clone + Ord, V: Leaf, { type InnermostValue = V; type KeyPath = K; fn union_nested_with&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, other: Self, merge_fn: F) where F: Fn(&amp;mut Self::InnermostValue, Self::InnermostValue) + Clone, { self.union_with(other, merge_fn); } } // Implemention for nested maps impl&lt;K, M&gt; NestedMap for HashMap&lt;K, M&gt; where K: Clone + Eq + Hash, M: NestedMap + Clone + Default, { type InnermostValue = M::InnermostValue; type KeyPath = (K, M::KeyPath); fn union_nested_with&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, other: Self, merge_fn: F) where F: Fn(&amp;mut Self::InnermostValue, Self::InnermostValue) + Clone, { for (key, other_inner) in other { let merge_fn_clone = merge_fn.clone(); match self.entry(key) { HashMapEntry::Vacant(entry) =&gt; { entry.insert(other_inner); }, HashMapEntry::Occupied(mut entry) =&gt; { entry.get_mut().union_nested_with(other_inner, merge_fn_clone); } } } } } impl&lt;K, M&gt; NestedMap for BTreeMap&lt;K, M&gt; where K: Clone + Ord, M: NestedMap + Clone + Default, { type InnermostValue = M::InnermostValue; type KeyPath = (K, M::KeyPath); fn union_nested_with&lt;F&gt;(&amp;mut self, other: Self, merge_fn: F) where F: Fn(&amp;mut Self::InnermostValue, Self::InnermostValue) + Clone, { for (key, other_inner) in other { let merge_fn_clone = merge_fn.clone(); match self.entry(key) { BTreeMapEntry::Vacant(entry) =&gt; { entry.insert(other_inner); }, BTreeMapEntry::Occupied(mut entry) =&gt; { entry.get_mut().union_nested_with(other_inner, merge_fn_clone); } } } } } </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ExcursionSavvy"> /u/ExcursionSavvy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1katf00/generics_how_do_i_write_recursive_methods_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1katf00/generics_how_do_i_write_recursive_methods_for/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been using Rust for long yet I decided to migrate my app&#39;s backend to axum. When I had to set up the tests for my API I realized there&#39;s no straightforward way to set up a test environment, run the tests, and then tear down that test environment. I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t search much for any test suites outside of the default `cargo test` one but everything that came up on Google about how to set up and tear down a test environment pointed to the `ctor` crate, which provides a macro to run code before the main function. I tried using it and realized that it worked well, but that if any of my tests panicked, then `dtor` (a macro that allows you to run code after the main function exits) didn&#39;t run at all, not allowing me to tear down the environment properly and becoming completely unreliable.</p> <p>I decided to build my own custom test suite that fit my needs, and after two days of messing with procedural macros I came up with something that looks pretty nice. I called it `testify-rs` (had to add the `-rs` in the last moment because there&#39;s a 3-year-old dead crate with the same name).</p> <p>It looks pretty much the same way `#[test]` does, but using `#[testify::test]`, and with a pretty and more compacted output log, tagging, test cases, async support, setup and cleanup hooks that are guaranteed to work, and a variety of test filters via glob patterns and tags. It&#39;s still missing a few core features but it&#39;s overall usable, so I wanted to know what your opinion was. As a rust newbie, any suggestions are completely welcome (and PRs).

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>... and that is (tldr) easy refactor of your code. You will always hear some advantages like memory safety, blazing speed, lifetimes, strong typing etc. But since im someone coming from python, these never represented that high importance for me, since I&#39;ve never had to deal with most of these problems before(except speed ofc), they were always abstracted from me. </p> <p>But, the other day, on my job, I was testing the new code and we were trying out different business logics applied to the data. After 2 weeks of various editing, the code became a steaming pile of spaghetti crap. Functions that took 10+ arguments and returned 10+ values, hard readability, nested sub functions etc.</p> <p>Ive decided its time to clean it up and store all that data and functions in classes, and it took me whole 2 days of refactoring. Since the code runs for 2+ hours, the last few problems to fix looked like: run the code, wait 1+ hours, get a runtime error, fix and repeat... For like 6-7 times. </p> <p>Similarly, few days ago I was solving similar issue in rust. Ive made a lot of editions to my crate and included 2 rust features modes of code , new dependencies, gpu acceleration with opencl etc. My structs started holding way too much data, lib.rs bloated to almost 2000 lines of code, functions increased to 10+ arguments and return values, structs holding 15+ fields etc. It was time to put all that data into structs and sub-structs and distribute code into additional files and folders. </p> <p>The process looked like: make a change, big part of codebase starts glowing red, just start replacing every red part with your new logic(sometimes not even knowing what or where I&#39;m changing, but dont care since compiler is making sure its correct) . Repeat for next change and like that for 10-15 more changes. </p> <p>In the end, my pull request went from +2000 - 200 to around +3500 - 1500 and it all took me maybe 45 minutes. I was just thinking, boy am I glad im not doing this in python, and if only I could have rust on my job so i can easily refactor like this. </p> <p>This led me to another though. People boast python as fast to develop something, and that is completely true. But when your codebase starts getting couple of thousand lines of code long, the speed diminishes. Im pretty sure at that point reading/understanding, updating, editing, fixing and contributing to rust codebase becomes a much faster process. </p> <p>Additionally, this easy refactor should not be ignored. Code that is worked on is evergrowing. Couple of thousand lines into the code you will not like how you set up some stuff in beginning. Files bloat, functions sizes increase, readability decreases.</p> <p>Having possibility of continous easy refactoring allows you to keep your code always clean with little hassle. In python, I&#39;m, sometimes just lazy to do it when I know it&#39;ll take me a whole day. Sometimes you start doing it and get into issues you can hardly pull yourself out, regretting ever starting the refactor and thinking of just doing git reset hard and saying fuck it, it&#39;ll be ugly. </p> <p>Sry this post ended up longer than I expected. Don&#39;t know if you will aggree with me, or maybe give me your counter opinion on this if you&#39;re coming from some other background. In any case, I&#39;m looking forward hearing your thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kichmad"> /u/Kichmad </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kai2t6/there_is_a_big_advantage_rust_provides_that_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kai2t6/there_is_a_big_advantage_rust_provides_that_i/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking about the evolution of video games and their impact and I couldn&#39;t help but feel the people who grew up during the great revolution of video games from the 90s till the mid 2000s might have a different perspective, especially the ones who were kids rather than adults, so late Gen X and Millennials. </p> <p>We went from the golden age of 2D games with their amazing color pallets and simple yet in depth mechanics, to the wild west of 3D video games in the mid to late 90s where so much experimentation was happening because 3D was still fresh but now the norm, to the next major leap in seeing cinematics weaved seamingly into gameplay on the PS2, Game Cube, and Xbox. From late 2000s and beyond games didnt have that same extreme leaps in evolution. Granted, indie games were on the rise but it&#39;s not quite the same when you experience games by seeing them hyped up on AAA level compared to finding out about them in forums or a banner in steam. It could also be the same for adults who also were there for the booming age of video games because adulthood seems to take so much focus away, so they didnt get to have the same wave of awe. Maybe it&#39;s just nostalgia but I do wonder if by getting to experience that timeline at a certain age allows devs to view games in a different way. I know for myself when I work on games, I more often than not think about the older games and how they did more with less and weaving simpler visual together with gameplay rather than trying to go big right off the bat. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/roger0120"> /u/roger0120 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kb451s/do_you_thin_current_devs_who_grew_up_on_games_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kb451s/do_you_thin_current_devs_who_grew_up_on_games_in/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while back, I made a whiney post asking why I&#39;m so bad at marketing. I got answers ranging from terrible and abusive to actually very useful. I thought I&#39;d say thank you and update you on my progress in case it&#39;s useful for someone out there. So, here&#39;s a list of (paraphrased) feedback and how I used it.</p> <p>Advice I used:</p> <ol> <li>&quot;How are we supposed to believe you&#39;re enthusiastic about your game when you don&#39;t even post a link?&quot;</li> </ol> <p>Well, I thought it was rude to do that, but if you&#39;re giving me the chance, here are my Steam and Itch links (and I will always and forever prefer itch even though some of you wrongfully think it&#39;s not serious or professional or whatever):</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3358040/AAA_Simulator/</a></p> <p><a href="https://whitelocke.itch.io/aaa-simulator-demo">https://whitelocke.itch.io/aaa-simulator-demo</a></p> <ol> <li>&quot;Your elevator pitch is confusing.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>Fair enough. I was pitching it as a &quot;tycoon roguelike,&quot; but that wasn&#39;t a great description because it&#39;s not really a tycoon game and &quot;roguelike&quot; is very open ended. I&#39;m now calling it a balatro-like studio builder that satirizes the games industry. As always, game developers I talk to/show my game to seem to love the idea and remain the core target audience, but I think there&#39;s definitely room for roguelike fans. All that being said, I don&#39;t think you can really &quot;get&quot; the game until you play it a bit, and that&#39;s fine. Balatro was also a play it and see game, and not all games can have immediate visual virality (I stand by that point from my original post).</p> <ol> <li>&quot;It&#39;s trying to be too many things and not doing any of them well.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>The TLDR of my reaction to this is that I made the game turn-based and it fixed SO many things. The long answer is that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad at all to mash up genres. In fact, that&#39;s what indie games are best at. However, the tricky part is deciding which parts to mash up. I was taking the real-time element of tycoon games for no reason and trying to put the casino roguelike cycle of store-&gt;gameplay-&gt;store into it. Making it turn-based gave pacing to the game and directed the core loop into a consistent flow of: react to an event-&gt;shop for synergies-&gt;upgrade the studio-&gt;hit next turn. Another thing I added was an active clicking element from the autobattler genre that really filled in that little something that was missing. In my latest playthrough I found myself absolutely stunned when the systems came together for the perfect satire (it&#39;s hard to explain, but it involved synergies combining to incentivize me to do mass layoffs and then immediately hire scores of cheap contractors-just like the real hellscape we live in!)</p> <ol> <li>&quot;Your art/screenshots/UI don&#39;t look good.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;ve been iterating on it and I think it&#39;s really coming together. Art is subjective, but I personally really like the art style. It&#39;s motivated by intentional design - it&#39;s meant to mix realism and corporate surrealism, it&#39;s inspired by the very common corporate isometric flat colored vector style, and most underlings intentionally don&#39;t have faces. Likewise, the UI is slanted to echo a profit graph going up and it&#39;s inspired by financial app dark modes. I showed a demo at an IGDA meetup recently and the first comment I got was &quot;I really like the art style.&quot; The one thing that still needs more work is the office environment. It&#39;s too much like a typical tycoon game and doesn&#39;t have enough visual comedy yet (although I&#39;m adding more every day). I&#39;ve also updated my storefronts with screenshots and a trailer, although I can never seem to get gifs to look good (if anyone has advice there let me know).</p> <ol> <li>&quot;Devlogs don&#39;t really sell games/Wishlists come from Steam and influencers, not your own YouTube.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>Absolutely. I&#39;ll still make some casual videos, but I realized I was a professional game developer trying to be a YouTuber. Once I stopped wasting my time on that, I was able to concentrate on making a good demo and a list of influencers which I&#39;ll start pitching soon. Then my bugs started disappearing in droves because I was back to doing what I&#39;m actually good at.</p> <p>Advice I ignored:</p> <p>1.&quot;ArE yOu MaKinG a MaRkEtAbLe GamE?&quot;</p> <p>The only thing this really tells me is you watched that YouTube video and wanted credit for parroting it. It&#39;s not really useful to tell people that if they can&#39;t market their game they should just make a better game. Sure, that&#39;s obvious. And yeah I was definitely approaching my vertical slice and publishers in a pre-2023 way where you could pitch an idea instead of a polished final product and get instant money. But nobody is out here making a game they don&#39;t think would be fun. I actually love my game and I&#39;m amazed what I&#39;ve done with it, so thanks but no thanks.</p> <ol> <li>&quot;Your title is bad.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>Yeah, it&#39;s not the best title, but it&#39;s too late to change it so it&#39;s going to stay AAA Simulator. It&#39;s not going to make or break the project, and a lot of titles are just meaningless words. And again, it&#39;s subjective. It was always meant to be a bit of a joke itself about the AAA industry (and there are a lot of similar jokes about cliched names in the game). It&#39;s also a bit of a troll to get to the top of alphabetized lists, and finally the game still does, in a very broad sense, qualify as a management sim. Get over it? I&#39;ll take no further questions.</p> <p>Anyway, thanks everyone again. In the end, only you can really identify what&#39;s wrong with your project, but a thorough roasting by Reddit can always get the ball rolling.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhiterLocke"> /u/WhiterLocke </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kam2g5/i_took_your_advice_and_my_game_has_massively/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kam2g5/i_took_your_advice_and_my_game_has_massively/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I want to make 3d games, and wgpu looks like a great option because it provides directx12, vulkan, metal backends, and I like that it cuts out a lot of the boilerplate, there&#39;s also zig lang, which provides great c/c++ inter op, but doesn&#39;t have the dev ux of rust. So I&#39;m mainly asking, can I learn gpu programming, make gpu accelerated stuff like let&#39;s say deep learning, or 3d game engine, using rust? is wgpu mature enough now that it can be used for these kind of projects, and provides good performance like c++(or close enough that it doesn&#39;t matter, and it&#39;s worth the productivity gains), and good for prototyping new ideas? Or should I just learn opengl then metal then vulkan using c++, or even zig? please let me know what the best options are: I mainly want to learn by making some sort of game engine/graphics gui programming, because seeing something on the screen is a great motivator. Another thing is that I want to build a strong foundation, learn good habits that would transfer well to when I learn c++ for gpu programming, it should be a smooth transition, and I would have experience with those low level concepts before just jumping into c++. I tried c++ with vulkan cmake vcpkg, but it was just way too hard in my opinion, I think either opengl, a game engine or something else might be better just to start with. Again this is where I&#39;m asking for advice: should I learn opengl first or vulkan? or something like wgpu that lets me use it without the boilerplate, but still exposes me to the concepts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Normal-Diver7342"> /u/Normal-Diver7342 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kaxgv9/how_mature_is_wgpu_now_can_i_use_rust_for_a_solo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1kaxgv9/how_mature_is_wgpu_now_can_i_use_rust_for_a_solo/">[comments]</a></span></div>
