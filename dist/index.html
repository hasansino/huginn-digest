    <h1>The FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module</h1>
      
      <p class="author">
      Filippo Valsorda (Geomys), Daniel McCarney (Geomys),  and Roland Shoemaker (Google)<br>
      15 July 2025
      </p>
      
      <p>FIPS 140 is a standard for cryptography implementations and, although it doesn‚Äôt
necessarily improve security, FIPS 140 compliance is a requirement in certain
regulated environments that are increasingly adopting Go. Until now, FIPS 140
compliance has been a significant source of friction for Go users, requiring
unsupported solutions with safety, developer experience, functionality, release
velocity, and compliance issues.</p>
<p>Go is addressing this growing need with native FIPS 140 support built right into
the standard library and the <code>go</code> command, making Go the easiest, most secure
way to comply with FIPS 140. The FIPS 140-3 validated Go Cryptographic Module
now underlies Go‚Äôs built-in crypto libraries, starting with the Go Cryptographic
Module v1.0.0 that is included in Go 1.24, released last February.</p>
<p>The v1.0.0 module has been awarded <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/details?validation=39260" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program
(CAVP) certificate A6650</a>, was submitted to the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP), and reached the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/modules-in-process-list" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Modules In Process List</a> in May.
Modules on the MIP list are awaiting NIST review and can already be deployed in
certain regulated environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://geomys.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Geomys</a> led the implementation effort in collaboration with the Go Security
Team, and is pursuing a broadly applicable FIPS 140-3 validation for the benefit
of the Go community. Google and other industry stakeholders have a contractual
relationship with Geomys to include specific Operating Environments in the
certificate.</p>
<p>We believe this to be the first non-JVM memory-safe library to get FIPS 140
validated.</p>
<p>Further details on the module are available in the
<a href="/doc/security/fips140">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Some Go users currently rely on the <a href="/doc/security/fips140#goboringcrypto">Go+BoringCrypto</a> GOEXPERIMENT, or on one
of its forks, as part of their FIPS 140 compliance strategy. Unlike the FIPS
140-3 Go Cryptographic Module, Go+BoringCrypto was never officially supported
and had significant developer experience issues, since it was produced
exclusively for the internal needs of Google. It will be removed in a future
release once Google migrates to the native module.</p>
<h2 id="a-native-developer-experience">A native developer experience</h2>
<p>The module integrates completely transparently into Go applications. In fact,
every Go program built with Go 1.24 already uses it for all FIPS 140-3 approved
algorithms! The module is just another name for the
<code>crypto/internal/fips140/...</code> packages of the standard library, which provide
the implementation of operations exposed by packages such as <code>crypto/ecdsa</code> and
<code>crypto/rand</code>.</p>
<p>These packages involve no cgo, meaning they cross-compile like any other Go
program, they pay no FFI performance overhead, and they don‚Äôt suffer from
<a href="/blog/tob-crypto-audit#cgo-memory-management">memory management security issues</a>, unlike Go+BoringCrypto and its forks.</p>
<p>When starting a Go binary, the module can be put into FIPS 140-3 mode with the
<code>fips140=on</code> <a href="/doc/godebug">GODEBUG option</a>, which can be set as an environment variable or
through the <code>go.mod</code> file. If FIPS 140-3 mode is enabled, the module will use
the NIST DRBG for randomness, <code>crypto/tls</code> will automatically only negotiate
FIPS 140-3 approved TLS versions and algorithms, and it will perform the
mandatory self-tests on initialization and during key generation. That‚Äôs it;
there are no other behavior differences.</p>
<p>There is also an experimental stricter mode, <code>fips140=only</code>, which causes all
non-approved algorithms to return errors or panic. We understand this might be
too inflexible for most deployments and are <a href="/issue/74630">looking for
feedback</a> on what a policy enforcement framework
might look like.</p>
<p>Finally, applications can use the <a href="/doc/security/fips140#the-gofips140-environment-variable"><code>GOFIPS140</code> environment
variable</a>
to build against older, validated versions of the <code>crypto/internal/fips140/...</code>
packages. <code>GOFIPS140</code> works like <code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code>, and if set to
<code>GOFIPS140=v1.0.0</code> the program will be built against the v1.0.0 snapshot of the
packages as they were submitted for validation to CMVP. This snapshot ships with
the rest of the Go standard library, as <code>lib/fips140/v1.0.0.zip</code>.</p>
<p>When using <code>GOFIPS140</code>, the <code>fips140</code> GODEBUG defaults to <code>on</code>, so putting it
all together, all that‚Äôs needed to build against the FIPS 140-3 module and run
in FIPS 140-3 mode is <code>GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 go build</code>. That‚Äôs it.</p>
<p>If a toolchain is built with <code>GOFIPS140</code> set, all builds it produces will
default to that value.</p>
<p>The <code>GOFIPS140</code> version used to build a binary can be verified with
<code>go version -m</code>.</p>
<p>Future versions of Go will continue shipping and working with v1.0.0 of the Go
Cryptographic Module until the next version is fully certified by Geomys, but
some new cryptography features might not be available when building against old
modules. Starting with Go 1.24.3, you can use <code>GOFIPS140=inprocess</code> to
dynamically select the latest module for which a Geomys validation has reached
the In Process stage. Geomys plans to validate new module versions at least
every year‚Äîto avoid leaving FIPS 140 builds too far behind‚Äîand every time a
vulnerability in the module can‚Äôt be mitigated in the calling standard library
code.</p>
<h2 id="uncompromising-security">Uncompromising security</h2>
<p>Our first priority in developing the module has been matching or exceeding the
security of the existing Go standard library cryptography packages. It might be
surprising, but sometimes the easiest way to achieve and demonstrate compliance
with the FIPS 140 security requirements is not to exceed them. We declined to
accept that.</p>
<p>For example, <code>crypto/ecdsa</code> <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.23.0:src/crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa.go;l=417" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">always produced hedged signatures</a>. Hedged
signatures generate nonces by combining the private key, the message, and random
bytes. Like <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">deterministic ECDSA</a>, they protect against failure of the
random number generator, which would otherwise leak the private key(!). Unlike
deterministic ECDSA, they are also resistant to <a href="https://github.com/MystenLabs/ed25519-unsafe-libs" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">API issues</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_fault_analysis" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">fault
attacks</a>, and they don‚Äôt leak message equality. FIPS 186-5 introduced support
for <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 6979</a> deterministic ECDSA, but not for hedged ECDSA.</p>
<p>Instead of downgrading to regular randomized or deterministic ECDSA signatures
in FIPS 140-3 mode (or worse, across modes), we <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/commit/9776d028f4b99b9a935dae9f63f32871b77c49af" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">switched the hedging
algorithm</a> and connected dots across half a dozen documents to <a href="https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-det-sigs-with-noise/issues/6#issuecomment-2067819904" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">prove the new
one is a compliant composition of a DRBG and traditional ECDSA</a>. While at it,
we also <a href="/doc/go1.24#cryptoecdsapkgcryptoecdsa">added opt-in support for deterministic signatures</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is random number generation. FIPS 140-3 has strict rules on how
cryptographic randomness is generated, which essentially enforce the use of a
userspace <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CSPRNG</a>. Conversely, we believe the kernel is best suited to
produce secure random bytes, because it‚Äôs best positioned to collect entropy
from the system, and to detect when processes or even virtual machines are
cloned (which could lead to reuse of supposedly random bytes). Hence,
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rand" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto/rand</a> routes every read operation to the kernel.</p>
<p>To square this circle, in FIPS 140-3 mode we maintain a compliant userspace NIST
DRBG based on AES-256-CTR, and then inject into it 128 bits sourced from the
kernel at every read operation. This extra entropy is considered ‚Äúuncredited‚Äù
additional data for FIPS 140-3 purposes, but in practice makes it as strong as
reading directly from the kernel‚Äîeven if slower.</p>
<p>Finally, all of the Go Cryptographic Module v1.0.0 was in scope for the <a href="/blog/tob-crypto-audit">recent
security audit by Trail of Bits</a>, and was
not affected by the only non-informational finding.</p>
<p>Combined with the memory safety guarantees provided by the Go compiler and
runtime, we believe this delivers on our goal of making Go one of the easiest,
most secure solutions for FIPS 140 compliance.</p>
<h2 id="broad-platform-support">Broad platform support</h2>
<p>A FIPS 140-3 module is only compliant if operated on a tested or ‚ÄúVendor
Affirmed‚Äù Operating Environment, essentially a combination of operating system
and hardware platform. To enable as many Go use cases as possible, the Geomys
validation is tested on <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-algorithm-validation-program/details?product=19371&amp;displayMode=Aggregated" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">one of the most comprehensive sets of Operating
Environments</a> in the industry.</p>
<p>Geomys‚Äôs laboratory tested various Linux flavors (Alpine Linux on Podman, Amazon
Linux, Google Prodimage, Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server), macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD on a mix of x86-64 (AMD and
Intel), ARMv8/9 (Ampere Altra, Apple M, AWS Graviton, and Qualcomm Snapdragon),
ARMv7, MIPS, z/ Architecture, and POWER, for a total of 23 tested environments.</p>
<p>Some of these were paid for by stakeholders, others were funded by Geomys for
the benefit of the Go community.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Geomys validation lists a broad set of generic platforms as Vendor
Affirmed Operating Environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux 3.10+ on x86-64 and ARMv7/8/9,</li>
<li>macOS 11‚Äì15 on Apple M processors,</li>
<li>FreeBSD 12‚Äì14 on x86-64,</li>
<li>Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016‚Äì2022 on x86-64, and</li>

<h2 id="comprehensive-algorithm-coverage">Comprehensive algorithm coverage</h2>
<p>It may be surprising, but even using a FIPS 140-3 approved algorithm implemented
by a FIPS 140-3 module on a supported Operating Environment is not necessarily
enough for compliance; the algorithm must have been specifically covered by
testing as part of validation. Hence, to make it as easy as possible to build
FIPS 140 compliant applications in Go, all FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms in the
standard library are implemented by the Go Cryptographic Module and were tested
as part of the validation, from digital signatures to the TLS key schedule.</p>
<p>The post-quantum ML-KEM key exchange (FIPS 203), <a href="/doc/go1.24#crypto-mlkem">introduced in Go 1.24</a>, is also validated, meaning <code>crypto/tls</code> can establish FIPS 140-3
compliant post-quantum secure connections with X25519MLKEM768.</p>
<p>In some cases, we validated the same algorithms under multiple different NIST
designations, to make it possible to use them in full compliance for different
purposes. For example, <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/fips-hkdf/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">HKDF is tested and validated under <em>four</em> names</a>:
SP 800-108 Feedback KDF, SP 800-56C two-step KDF, Implementation Guidance D.P
OneStepNoCounter KDF, and SP 800-133 Section 6.3 KDF.</p>
<p>Finally, we validated some internal algorithms such as CMAC Counter KDF, to make
it possible to expose future functionality such as <a href="https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">XAES-256-GCM</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the native FIPS 140-3 module delivers a better compliance profile than
Go+BoringCrypto, while making more algorithms available to FIPS 140-3 restricted
applications.</p>
<p>We look forward to the new native Go Cryptographic Module making it easier and
safer for Go developers to run FIPS 140 compliant workloads.</p>

I got tired of endlessly scrolling up to find where my last command&#39;s output started, so I took inspiration from modern chat apps and IDE terminals and built halo with a <strong>bottom-up, block-based interface</strong>.</p> <p>Each command and its output is a self-contained block that pushes upwards, which feels incredibly intuitive.</p> <h1>The Stack &amp; Cool Features:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Core:</strong> Built with ratatui for the TUI, crossterm for terminal manipulation, and tokio for a fully async backend. Every command runs without ever blocking the UI.</li> <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> It was a great (and sometimes painful!) learning experience with Rust&#39;s ownership and lifetime rules, especially when passing data from async command tasks back to the UI state. We finally landed on a clean, single-owner state model that works great.</li> <li><strong>Smart Autocompletion:</strong> The completion engine is context-aware. It knows to suggest only directories for cd, but executables and files for other commands.</li> <li><strong>Git Integration:</strong> The status bar automatically shows the current Git branch and dirty status.</li> <li><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> The design is a custom &quot;Cyber-Nord&quot; theme that I tried to make clean, modern, and fun to use.</li> </ul> <p>This has been an amazing learning project, and I&#39;m really proud of how it&#39;s turned out so far. Still a lot of things to finish, polish and implement, I&#39;ll try keeping it updated.</p> <p><strong>GitHub Repo:</strong> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FGoddv%2Fhalo"><strong>https://github.com/Goddv/halo</strong></a></p> <p>I would absolutely love any feedback on the code, architecture, or features. If you think it&#39;s cool, a star on GitHub would make my day!</p> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Comprehensive_Leg642"> /u/Comprehensive_Leg642 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m0vt9y/halo_next_generation_shell_written_fully_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m0vt9y/halo_next_generation_shell_written_fully_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A while back, I wrote a <a href="https://altunenes.github.io/posts/rust/">blog post</a> based on my implicit assumptions. My main point was that even though the learning curve is steep, the Rust compiler&#39;s strictness is ultimately a benefit. It offloads a significant amount of mental work (like tracking memory), which can be a major relief for a brain that finds working memory or executive function challenging.</p> <p>But the thing is, this was mostly based on my own experience. I couldn&#39;t find much data to back it up when I wrote it, and I&#39;m very aware of my own potential biases.</p> <p>So I wanted to ask you. For those of you with ADHD, do you find Rust to be a helpful language that provides structure, or is its demand for upfront correctness just a source of frustration that gets in the way?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, the last time I wrote an update about my Rust project was almost 4 months ago. At that time, I was a lonely developer trying to create a lightweight service mesh from scratch. Back then, I started this project in January as a personal software engineering challenge, and I didn&#39;t expect to gain a single bit of support, but after some weeks, I started receiving pull requests from random and interested developers. Right now, the project is slowly growing, and we&#39;re actively maintaining and expanding the feature landscape. We have introduced a dedicated command line interface and network connection tracker leveraging the power of BPF programs and the Linux kernel. We&#39;re working on the next update, where we will finally introduce detailed networking and kernel metrics and hopefully an integrated dashboard for data visualization.</p> <p>For all the curious people who want to know more about it, contribute to a fresh project, or simply leave support/advice below, there&#39;s the link to the project.

The difference is, linear types can&#39;t be dropped arbitrarily. Additionally, Par features duality.</li> <li>Both Rust and Par share the vision of ruling out structural bugs with their type systems.</li> <li><strong>Par is written in Rust!</strong></li> </ol> <h2><a href="https://github.com/faiface/par-lang">What is Par?</a></h2> <p>For those of you who don&#39;t know, <a href="https://github.com/faiface/par-lang">Par</a> is a new programming language based on <strong>classical linear logic</strong> (via Curry-Howard isomorphism, don&#39;t let it scare you!).</p> <p>Jean-Yves Girard ‚Äî the author of linear logic wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>The new connectives of linear logic have obvious meanings in terms of parallel computation, especially the multiplicatives.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>So, we&#39;re putting that to practice!</p> <p>As we&#39;ve been using Par, it&#39;s become more and more clear that multiple paradigms naturally emerge in it:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Functional programming</strong> with side-effects via linear handles.</li> <li>A <strong>unique object-oriented style,</strong> where interfaces are just types and implementations are just values.</li> <li>An <strong>implicit concurrency,</strong> where execution is non-blocking by default.</li> </ul> <p>It&#39;s really quite a fascinating language, and I&#39;m very excited to be working on it!</p> <p><strong>Link to repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/faiface/par-lang">https://github.com/faiface/par-lang</a></p> <h2>What&#39;s new?</h2> <h3>Primitives &amp; I/O</h3> <p>For the longest time, Par was fully abstract. It had no I/O, and primitives like numbers had to be defined manually. Somewhat like lambda-calculus, or rather, pi-calculus, since Par is a process language.</p> <p>That&#39;s changed! Now we have: - <strong>Primitives: <code>Int</code>, <code>Nat</code> (natural numbers), <code>String</code>, <code>Char</code></strong> - <strong>A bunch of built-in functions for them</strong> - <strong>Basic I/O for console and reading files</strong></p> <p>I/O has been quite fun, since Par&#39;s runtime is based on interaction network, which you may know from <a href="https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM">HVM</a>. While the current implementations are still basic, Par&#39;s I/O foundation seems to be very strong and flexible!</p> <h3><a href="https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/introduction.html">All New Documentation!</a></h3> <p>Par is in its own family. It&#39;s a process language, with duality, deadlock-freedom, and a bunch of unusual features, like <a href="https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/choice.html">choices</a> and <a href="https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/recursive.html">inline recursion</a> and <a href="https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/types/iterative.html">corecursion</a>.</p> <p>Being a one of a kind language, it needs a bit of learning for things to click. The good news is, <strong>I completely rewrote the documentation!</strong> Now it&#39;s a <strong>little book</strong> that you can read front to back. Even if you don&#39;t see yourself using the language, you might find it an interesting read!</p> <p><strong>Link to the docs:</strong> <a href="https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/introduction.html">https://faiface.github.io/par-lang/introduction.html</a></p> <h3>Upcoming live demo!</h3> <p>On the <strong>19th of July,</strong> I&#39;m hosting a <strong>live demo on <a href="https://discord.gg/8KsypefW99">Discord!</a></strong> We&#39;ll be covering:</p> <ul> <li>New features</li> <li>Where&#39;s Par heading</li> <li>Coding a concurrent grep</li> <li>Q&amp;A</li> </ul> <p>Yes, I&#39;ll be coding a concurrent grep (lite) in Par. That&#39;ll be a program that traverses a directory, and prints lines of files that match a query string.</p> <p><strong>I&#39;ll be happy to see you there!</strong> No problem if not, the event will be recorded and posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5v_0-3sx0fcw1bzUIKE8Kg">YouTube.</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/faiface"> /u/faiface </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m0j6h2/par_lang_primitives_io_all_new_documentation_book/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m0j6h2/par_lang_primitives_io_all_new_documentation_book/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Follow-up to ‚ÄúGenPool: A Faster, Tunable Alternative to sync.Pool‚Äù</strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GenPool"><strong>https://github.com/AlexsanderHamir/GenPool</strong></a></p> <p>First off, huge thanks to everyone who read, shared, and gave feedback on the last post. The response was more than I expected, and it helped shape where GenPool is today. This update‚Äî<strong>GenPool v1.6: Modern Software, and What sync.Pool Gets Wrong</strong>‚Äîbuilds directly on that conversation, diving deeper into where sync.Pool struggles in real-world scenarios and how GenPool is evolving to better support everyday workloads.</p> <p><strong>What sync.Pool Gets Wrong ?</strong></p> <p><strong>Current Design Overview</strong></p> <p>The Go sync.Pool is a fast, GC-aware object pool designed to reduce allocation pressure in high-performance scenarios. It uses per-processor (per-P) local storage to make most Get() and Put() calls lock-free, minimizing contention. When a GC occurs, the current pool is cleared and its objects move to a <em>victim cache</em>, letting them survive one more GC cycle. If no object is found locally or in the victim cache, sync.Pool falls back to a global pool guarded by a mutex. This design makes it especially suited for short-lived, ephemeral objects.</p> <p><strong>Design Limitations</strong></p> <p>While sync.Pool performs exceptionally well when objects are returned quickly under low contention, it has important limitations that affect its reliability and flexibility. The most notable downside is its unpredictability ‚Äî objects may be collected by the garbage collector at any time, making reuse unreliable in long-lived or stateful workloads. It also lacks any tunable configuration: you can‚Äôt control maximum pool size, or eviction policies. Its utility is primarily bound to short bursts of allocation where the overhead of creating new objects is high and objects are quickly discarded.</p> <p><strong>Work Arounds</strong></p> <p>For CPU or I/O-intensive systems, you can mitigate sync.Pool‚Äôs limitations by designing your workflow to release objects as soon as possible. Instead of holding onto objects unnecessarily during costly operations on small portions of their data, <strong>sometimes</strong> making a copy of a small subset of data is less expensive than holding onto the <strong>entire</strong> object for way too long, which is likely to degrade the performance of sync.Pool.</p> <p><strong>Misconceptions</strong></p> <p>A common misconception is that object pools primarily make programs faster or that they should only be used in high-performance systems. In reality, their main purpose is to reduce memory allocations and ease garbage collector pressure, which can indirectly improve performance by lowering GC overhead and avoiding repeated expensive allocations. However, pooling doesn‚Äôt guarantee faster code‚Äîretaining pooled objects during expensive operations or for longer than necessary can negate its benefits or even degrade performance. While this may seem obvious in theory, many real-world systems still make this mistake. Ultimately, object pools optimize memory management and GC behavior rather than raw execution speed, providing gains mainly in workloads with many short-lived objects.</p> <p><strong>Modern Software</strong></p> <p>You don‚Äôt need to do any research to know it‚Äôs not the high-performance systems that are abusing memory‚Äîit‚Äôs everyday software, where no one‚Äôs really thinking about performance. Hardware has improved so much for so long that the bar for what counts as ‚Äúgood‚Äù software keeps getting lowered to just ‚Äúas long as it works.‚Äù</p> <p>I‚Äôm not asking anyone to obsess over nanoseconds or overengineer everything they build‚Äîbut please, stop shipping notes apps that use more memory than YouTube.

Here are a few reasons why:</p> <ul> <li>It decouples the sender (client) from the receiver (server) - perfect for distributed architectures.</li> <li>It makes it easy to model transactional behavior.</li> <li>It provides undo/redo functionality.</li> <li>And honestly, it just feels right to send Commands to a server.</li> </ul> <p>While REST centers on resources and a uniform interface to manipulate them, the Command Pattern focuses on actions (like RPC) encapsulated into objects.</p> <p>Given all that, I built <code>cmd-stream-go</code>, which treats Commands as first-class citizens and is about 3x faster than gRPC in my benchmarks. That kind of performance boost not only speeds up communication, but can also help reduce infrastructure costs.</p> <p>To learn more about the project and its concepts, the following links are available:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href="https://github.com/cmd-stream/cmd-stream-go">cmd-stream-go project</a>.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/go-client-server-benchmarks">Benchmarks</a>.</li> <li>A series of posts describing the <a href="https://medium.com/p/f9e53442c85d">Command Pattern and how it can be applied over the network</a>.</li> </ul> <p>If you have any questions or input, feel free to reach me under <code>ymz-ncnk</code> on the Gophers Slack.

In particular, I&#39;m curious how you handle <code>internal/</code> packages that are shared across more than one microservice.</p> <p>The first I&#39;ve seen is just a flat structure within <code>internal/</code> <code> project/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billing/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retry/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code> I&#39;m not a huge fan of this since I don&#39;t get an idea of what&#39;s just used by one service or what&#39;s shared.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also seen the use of an <code>internal/pkg</code> directory for shared packages, with the other folders named after the microservice they belong to: <code> project/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ email/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billing/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invoice/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/ # shared internal packages ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retry/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code> I don&#39;t mind this one tbh.</p> <p>The next thing I&#39;ve seen is from that GitHub repo many people dislike (I&#39;m sure you know the one I&#39;m talking about) which has an <code>internal/app</code> in addition to the <code>internal/pkg</code>: <code> project/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ email/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billing/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invoice/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retry/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code> I honestly don&#39;t mind this either. Although it feels a bit overkill. Not a fan of <code>app</code> either.</p> <p>Finally, one that I actually haven&#39;t seen anywhere is having an <code>internal/</code> within the specific microservice&#39;s <code>cmd</code> folder: <code> project/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ # packages specific to userservice ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user/ ‚îÇ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ email/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ billingservice/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ # packages specific to billingservice ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billing/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ invoice/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/ # shared packages ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/ ‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/ ‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ retry/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ go.mod </code></p> <p>I&#39;m 50/50 on this one. I can take a glance at it and know what packages belong to a specific microservice and which ones are shared amongst all. Although it doesn&#39;t seem at all inline with the examples at <a href="https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout">https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout</a></p> <p>I&#39;m probably leaning towards option #2 with <code>internal/pkg</code>, since it provides a nice way to group shared packages. I also don&#39;t like the naming of <code>app</code> in option #3.</p> <p>Anyways, I was wondering what the rest of the community does, especially those with a wealth of experience. Is it one of the above or something different entirely? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zibi04"> /u/Zibi04 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m0h50w/how_do_you_structure_your_shared_internal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m0h50w/how_do_you_structure_your_shared_internal/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently, I rewrote some of my processing library in go, and the performance is not very encouraging. The main culprit is golang&#39;s inflexible synchronization mechanism.</p> <p>We all know that cache miss or cache invalidation causes a normally 0.1ns~0.2ns instruction to waste 20ns~50ns fetching cache. Now, in golang, mutex or channel will synchronize cache line of ALL cpu cores, effectively pausing all goroutines by 20~50ns CPU time. And you cannot isolate any goroutine because they are all in the same process, and golang lacks the fine-grained weak synchonization C++ has.</p> <p>We can bypass full synchronization by using atomic Load/Store instead of heavyweight mutex/channel. But this does not quite work because a goroutine often needs to wait for another goroutine to finish; it can check an atomic flag to see if another goroutine has finished its job; BUT, golang does not offer a way to block until a condition is met without full synchronization. So either you use a nonblocking infinite loop to check flags (which is very expensive for a single CPU core), or you block with full synchronization (which is cheap for a single CPU core but stalls ALL other CPU cores).</p> <p>The upshot is golang&#39;s concurrency model is useless for CPU-bound tasks. I salvaged my golang library by replacing all mutex and channels by unix socket --- instead of doing mutex locking, I send and receive unix socket messages through syscalls -- this is much slower (~200ns latency) for a single goroutine but at least it does not pause other goroutines.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/honda-harpaz"> /u/honda-harpaz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m0bc9g/challenges_of_golang_in_cpu_intensive_tasks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m0bc9g/challenges_of_golang_in_cpu_intensive_tasks/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m07gdk/i_created_an_http3_server_library_in_go_faster/" target="_blank">I created an HTTP/3 server library in Go faster than FastAPI, [50% faster p90 and 153x faster boot time]. Not so ready for production, but roast me! I am a junior dev btw.</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/ayushanand18/as-http3lib">https://github.com/ayushanand18/as-http3lib</a><br/> So, I had earlier created an HTTP/3 server library (you can use it host your server for H/1.1, H/2 and H/3 traffic) built over quic-go (go implementation for QUIC). It has significant performance gains than FastAPI (which many startups at this time use, to host their APIs). I have added a ton of support, but just haven&#39;t tested out media/file transfers.</p> <h1>Some Stats - Results</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Parameter</th> <th align="left">ashttp3lib::h1</th> <th align="left">FastAPI (H/1.1)</th> <th align="left">ashttp3lib::h3</th> <th align="left">ashttp3lib-go::h3 [latest]</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left"></td> <td colspan="4" align="left"></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">Startup Time</td> <td align="left">0.005 s</td> <td align="left">0.681 s</td> <td align="left">0.014 s</td> <td align="left">4.4499ms</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">RTT (p50)</td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left">1.751ms</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">RTT (p90)</td> <td align="left">6.88 ms</td> <td align="left">7.68 ms</td> <td align="left">4.49 ms</td> <td align="left">3.765ms</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">RTT (p95)</td> <td align="left">8.97 ms</td> <td align="left">9.34 ms</td> <td align="left">7.74 ms</td> <td align="left">4.796ms</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">RTT (p99)</td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left"></td> <td align="left">7.678ms</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>I am open to getting roasted (constructive feedback).
