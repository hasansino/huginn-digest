I started learning to code when I was 12. I&#39;m super passionate about programming and lately have been wanting to start contributing to open source. I have been writing rust for about 2 years at this point and have really enjoyed working with it. I have been using it for some personal projects which has been fun but none of my developer friends write rust and have been missing the collaborative aspect of working on projects. I also want to see what it is like working with rust on a larger project. I was wondering if you guys know of any good open source projects in rust I could start contributing to. The last thing I wanna do inconvenience any maintainers so preferably one that is welcoming to first time contributors. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/joegoggin27"> /u/joegoggin27 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k5mkc9/looking_for_advice_get_started_contributing_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k5mkc9/looking_for_advice_get_started_contributing_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

There wouldn&#39;t be any harm in pretending the never type implements all traits, right?

This decoupling means you <strong>can write your movement, collision, and game rules once, and run them in different modes/environments!</strong> </p> <p>For example, In the newest <a href="https://github.com/TheBitDrifter/bappa/releases/tag/0.0.4-experimental">release</a> (0.0.4), the <a href="https://github.com/TheBitDrifter/bappacreate/tree/main/templates/platformer-netcode">platformer-netcode</a> template shares the same core logic between its standalone and its client/server version with minimal fuss.</p> <p>It&#39;s still early days, but it&#39;s becoming quite capable.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello. I am one half of a small two man hobby team. This month we just released our fourth game in nine years. We hope our recent experience can help others.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong></p> <p>We are getting older. We have both been creating games as a part time hobby for decades while holding down full time jobs. I find this a much more stable approach to game development, especially if you have family. Because you don&#39;t rely on the income of a game to support you, I also find it allows you a lot more creativity. Our previous 3 games as a studio were released between 7 and 9 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. One of our old games managed to make low 6 figures, and this modest success was huge for us back in the day.</p> <p>The idea for our latest game evolved organically. We both found that as we got older and had more responsibilities (and children) that our time for gaming was reduced. We both really liked 4x strategy games but they take forever and we found we never even booted them up when they required long play sessions. So we decided to try and take the genre but make it so a full game could be played very quickly. Basically a 4x game for dads by dads.... but of course anyone was welcome to the party.</p> <p>As hobbyists we worked at our own pace. After 4 years of development the game was basically done in June of 2024. At this point we started shopping it around to publishers hoping to launch in the fall/winter. This stage did not go as well as we hoped. We got consistent feedback that the game was very fun and hooked players, but that our presentation and UI needed a lot of work. One publisher said we needed to redo 90% of the artwork for the game to be marketable. Another described the experience as &quot;color vomit&quot;. And here we thought we were ready to launch.</p> <p>As a tiny team under no deadline or pressure we were free to do what we wanted. We decided to push the launch out another 10 months and just spend the time on polish. My development partner is also our artist, and he redid close to 95% of the art in response to the feedback. He also completely changed the color palette and went for a much more cohesive style. We tested and retested our UI until it was slick and accessible, constantly finding new test players to try it out and find friction points.</p> <p>While the publisher feedback was valuable, in the end no publisher deal was to our (or their) liking. Typically publishers were not willing to dedicate more than a small ad spend for the overall percentage that they wanted in return. So we just decided to self publish.</p> <p><strong>Launch:</strong></p> <p>We launched with about 7,000 wishlists, close to 6,000 of which had come from the February 25 NextFest. Our conversion rate was decent and is still climbing.</p> <p>Still, our initial launch was hit with a surprising wave of negativity. The majority of our early reviews were negative, often asking for features that had never come up during our lengthy testing and polishing. It is a good reminder that no matter how much you test and refine a game pre launch, nothing is quite like getting feedback from the mob. Or just from players that aren&#39;t familiar with your intention for the game.</p> <p>Oftentimes it seems like new developers think that if they do this or that exactly right they can control the launch experience. I&#39;m sorry to say that at best you can set yourself up in a good position, but what you really need to be able to do is react real time to player feedback after launch. You just can&#39;t control the audience no matter how much you plan. This is true for AAA and indie across the board.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what has happened in the last 7 years since our last game, but it feels like the social contract between developers and gamers has really broken down. We had people leaving feedback who claimed we would ban them for providing criticism. Why? We want feedback. Many of the comments and DMs were framed as if the gamer was assuming we were trying to take advantage of them or ruin their fun. This was not the creator/player experience we had in the days of yore. Why has this changed so much?</p> <p><strong>Post Launch:</strong></p> <p>So prelaunch (after our 10 months of polish) we had almost unanimously positive feedback from potential publishers and testers. Because of this we were a little blindsided by the initial negative reaction. You can never make everyone happy, and it is a waste of energy to try to do so. But our customers wanted new features and options that we had simply never envisioned.</p> <p>So it was time to get to work. If you think crunch before launch is bad, it was nothing like what we went through post launch. At one point I only got 2 hours sleep in a three day period, and I was only getting around 10 hours of sleep a week. This effort paid off and we managed to respond to every comment, DM and review. Additionally we put out 3 patches this month since launch, each one addressing large chunks of feedback.</p> <p>I also wanted to change the tenor of the discussion. Reforge our social contract with our customers at the very least. In one of the patch notes I included this message:</p> <p><em>It is part of the process of making a game that there will always be players who find fault and want something different. To those players we want to say</em> <strong><em>&quot;We hear you, we take your feedback seriously, and we are trying our best.&quot;</em></strong></p> <p>Now saying you are trying your best means nothing without meaningful action. However we had the action to back up our statement as we made some pretty big changes to the game in a short period. I credit the fact that we are just 2 guys with our ability to be agile this quickly. Large organizations turn like battleships.</p> <p>All in all I would say our scramble post launch worked out great! While this is a continuing conversation, as of now we have addressed or have a roadmap for all the major points brought up by our new audience. We managed to flip reviews from negative to positive with our work, and at one point got all the way up to 96% positive, a massive swing from 30% positive.</p> <p>The worst thing you can do is ignore valuable feedback just because you don&#39;t appreciate how that feedback is presented. While the aggressive tone of the conversation with some of our customers was unexpected, in the end we now have a game that is better for the dialogue. We also now have a very respectful discussion in our forums and DMs where players are sharing their ideas and experiences.</p> <p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p> <p>A question I often see from newer developers is how do you stay motivated? After working on the same project for many years I will offer my insight.</p> <p>I would say first, keep the day job. When game development is your reward at the end of a long day it is easy to look forward to. When it IS your job, it is easy to start dreading it as an obligation that makes the day long.</p> <p>Also, motivation ebbs and flows. We worked on our current game for 4 years (5 with polish), and progress was not steady throughout. There were some months where almost no work got done. There were many months where a LOT of work got done. You are not a machine, you are a creative. Let the project flow.</p> <p>Still, if you DO consistently lack motivation... I recommend you seriously ask yourself if you even really want to be a developer. I see a lot of people who like the idea of being a developer more than the reality of being one. If it doesn&#39;t call to you, if you don&#39;t dream and daydream about it, maybe it is not the right path for you.</p> <p><strong>Sales:</strong></p> <p>Our initial sales were OK but not great. I&#39;m hearing that from a lot of my peers in a number of fields these days. We will probably lose money overall, just because of how much went into this over time (hopefully not, but being realistic). </p> <p>If someone said something took 5 years of their free time and cost them money for many people, they would just be describing their TV habit. Or a favorite hobby. As a hobby this is still much cheaper than cars or wine or dozens of other things people choose to do with their free time. In the end we have a unique game to show for our time that can entertain others.</p> <p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong></p> <p>Overall I&#39;m proud of what we created. While there is interest we will continue to work on patches and maybe even new DLC. It is a great feeling to make something that most people enjoy.</p> <p>For newer devs out there I would say that nothing is quite like the feeling of knowing you gave a customer a good experience. Keep at it.</p> <p>For reference the game can be found here:</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096370/Hyper_Empire/">Hyper Empire</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stormcoil"> /u/Stormcoil </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k56jxm/april_release_by_a_2_man_indie_a_post_mortem/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1k56jxm/april_release_by_a_2_man_indie_a_post_mortem/">[comments]</a></span></div>
