            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Short intro: sentinel is a standalone demon that allows you to build highly available redis/valkey installations. Essentially, it does three things:</p> <ul> <li>Perform periodic health checks of valkey/redis servers</li> <li>Automatically perform master failover</li> <li>Provide clients with routing information (who is the current master) All those things are done within a quorum, i.e. multiple sentinels shall agree on server status, failover candidate etc.</li> </ul> <p>On paper, it is just what you need if you just want HA redis. In practice, I failed miserably to get Sentinel work as I want it to. Dunno, maybe it&#39;s stupid me, or some wrong assumptions, or just buggy implementation, but that really doesn&#39;t matter. It wasn&#39;t working for me, I was not happy about that and I wrote my own - <a href="https://github.com/beebeeep/vkcp">VKCP</a> (Valkey Controller and Proxy).</p> <p>I didn&#39;t felt like reimplementing the whole Redis protocol, it&#39;s not a <em>drop-in</em> replacement of Sentinel (it works as sort of router - client connects there, asks where the current master is and connects to it), but rather a transparent TCP proxy that just proxies incoming client connection to current master. Although arguably it&#39;s even better because Sentinel mode is a separate story and not every redis client implements it, while with VKCP you just connect to it just as to usual redis.</p> <p>The way it works is fairly simple - set of VKCP instances upon startup will elect the leader that will start checking health of redis servers and distribute health information among its followers. If current master goes down, leader will select a new master, promote it, and reconfigure remaining servers to replicate from it. When old master will come back up, it will be reconfigured as slave. Either VKCP node has information about redis cluster topology so client can connect to any and will be proxied to correct master. Leader election is similar to one in Raft protocol - as a matter of fact, I just copypasted it from my other pet project, KV database with Raft.</p> <p>From technical perspective it&#39;s nothing extraordinary - tokio and tonic (leader election works via GRPC). State machine implementing leader elections and healthchecks is using actor model to avoid too much fun with shared mutable state.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/beebeeep"> /u/beebeeep </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mtq6px/i_wrote_an_alternative_to_redisvalkey_sentinel/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mtq6px/i_wrote_an_alternative_to_redisvalkey_sentinel/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôve created a web app that generates some temporary files during its processing. I‚Äôm thinking of creating a worker thread that will delete every file in the temp folder, then call <code>tokio::sleep()</code> with a duration of one week. It‚Äôll run alongside the main application with <code>tokio::select!</code>, and the worker thread will simply never exit under normal circumstances.</p> <p>Anyways, is there anything wrong with this approach? Is there a better way to schedule tasks like this? I know cron is an option, but my understanding of it is limited. Plus, this app will run in a Docker container, and it seems like Docker + cron is even more of a headache than regular cron.</p> <p>Edit: For a little more context, this is an app for analyzing x-ray images that‚Äôll be used at the small manufacturing company I work at. Everything will be hosted on local, on-premises servers, and the only user is the guy who runs our x-ray machine lol. Not that I want to excuse bad programming, it‚Äôs just that the concerns are a little different when it‚Äôs not consumer-facing software. Anyways, once the analysis is generated (which includes some contrast changes and circles around potential defects located by the x-ray), and the results are displayed on a web page, the images are no longer needed. The original image is archived, and there‚Äôs a lookup feature that simply re-runs the analysis routine on the raw image and re-generates the result images. All I‚Äôd like is to make sure there‚Äôs not a glut of these images building up long after they‚Äôre needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dmkolobanov"> /u/dmkolobanov </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mtond5/is_calling_tokiosleep_with_a_duration_of_one_week/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mtond5/is_calling_tokiosleep_with_a_duration_of_one_week/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After a little less than six months, I‚Äôm releasing a new version of my three distinct (yet similar) duplicate-finding programs today.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/mk0c268rfsjf1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b958e3d0e4994fd917d805cb2b43e9b8ffc9470f">https://preview.redd.it/mk0c268rfsjf1.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b958e3d0e4994fd917d805cb2b43e9b8ffc9470f</a></p> <p>The list of fixes and new features may seem random, and in fact it is, because I tackled them in the order in which ideas for their solutions came to mind. I know that the list of reported issues on GitHub is quite long, and for each user their own problem seems the most important, but with limited time I can only address a small portion of them, and I don‚Äôt necessarily pick the most urgent ones.</p> <p>Interestingly, this version is the largest so far (at least if you count the number of lines changed). Krokiet now contains almost all the features I used in the GTK version, so it looks like I myself will soon switch to it completely, setting an example for other undecided users (as a reminder, the GTK version is already in maintenance mode, and I focus there exclusively on bug fixes, not adding new features).</p> <p>As usual, the binaries for all three projects (<code>czkawka_cli</code>, <code>krokiet</code>, and <code>czkawka_gui</code>), along with a short legend explaining what the individual names refer to and where these files can be used, can be found in the releases section on GitHub ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases">https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases</a></p> <h1>Adding memory usage limits when loading the cache</h1> <p>One of the random errors that sometimes occurred due to the user, sometimes my fault, and sometimes ‚Äî for example ‚Äî because a power outage shut down the computer during operation, was a mysterious crash at the start of scanning, which printed the following information to the terminal:</p> <pre><code>memory allocation of 201863446528 bytes failed </code></pre> <p>Cache files that were corrupted by the user (or due to random events) would crash when loaded by the bincode library. Another situation, producing an error that looked identical, occurred when I tried to remove cache entries for non-existent or unavailable files using an incorrect struct for reading the data (in this case, the fix was simply changing the struct type into which I wanted to decode the data).</p> <p>This was a rather unpleasant situation, because the application would crash for the user during scanning or when pressing the appropriate button, leaving them unsure of what to do next. Bincode provides the possibility of adding a memory limit for data decoding. The fix required only a few lines of code, and that could have been the end of it. However, during testing it turned out to be an unexpected breaking change‚Äîdata saved with a memory-limited configuration cannot be read with a standard configuration, and vice versa.</p> <pre><code>use std::collections::BTreeMap; use bincode::{serialize_into, Options}; const MEMORY_LIMIT: u64 = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1 GB fn main() { let rands: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = (0..1).map(|_| rand::random::&lt;u32&gt;()).collect(); let btreemap: BTreeMap&lt;u32, Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt; = rands .iter() .map(|&amp;x| (x % 10, rands.clone())) .collect(); let options = bincode::DefaultOptions::new().with_limit(MEMORY_LIMIT); let mut serialized: Vec&lt;_&gt; = Vec::new(); options.serialize_into(&amp;mut serialized, &amp;btreemap).unwrap(); println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, serialized); let mut serialized2: Vec&lt;_&gt; = Vec::new(); serialize_into(&amp;mut serialized2, &amp;btreemap).unwrap(); println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, serialized2); } [1, 1, 1, 252, 53, 7, 34, 7] [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 53, 7, 34, 7] </code></pre> <p>The above code, when serializing data with and without the limit, produces two different results, which was very surprising to me because I thought that the limiting option applied only to the decoding code, and not to the file itself (it seems to me that most data encoding libraries write only the raw data to the file).</p> <p>So, like it or not, this version (following the path of its predecessors) has a cache that is incompatible with previous versions. This was one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt implement it earlier ‚Äî I had tried adding limits only when reading the file, not when writing it (where I considered it unnecessary), and it didn‚Äôt work, so I didn‚Äôt continue trying to add this functionality.</p> <p>I know that for some users it‚Äôs probably inconvenient that in almost every new version they have to rebuild the cache from scratch, because due to changed structures or data calculation methods, it‚Äôs not possible to simply read old files. So in future versions, I‚Äôll try not to tamper too much with the cache unless necessary (although, admittedly, I‚Äôm tempted to add a few extra parameters to video files in the next version, which would force the use of the new cache).</p> <p>An alternative would be to create a built-in tool for migrating cache files. However, reading arbitrary external data without memory limits in place would make such a tool useless and prone to frequent crashes. Such a tool is only feasible from the current version onward, and it may be implemented in the future.</p> <h1>Translations in Krokiet</h1> <p>To match the feature set currently available in Czkawka, I decided to try to implement the missing translations, which make it harder for some users, less proficient in English, to use the application.</p> <p>One might think that since Slint itself is written in Rust, using the Fluent library inside it, which is also written in Rust, would be an obvious and natural choice. However, for various reasons, the authors decided that it‚Äôs better to use probably the most popular translation tool instead ‚Äî gettext, which, however, complicates compilation and almost makes cross-compilation impossible (the issue aims to change this situation ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/3715">https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/issues/3715</a>).</p> <p>Without built-in translation support in Slint, what seemed like a fairly simple functionality turned into a tricky puzzle of how to implement it best. My goal was to allow changing the language at runtime, without needing to restart the entire application.</p> <p>Ultimately, I decided that the best approach would be to create a singleton containing all the translation texts, in a style like this:</p> <pre><code>export global Translations { in-out property &lt;string&gt; ok_button_text: &quot;Ok&quot;; in-out property &lt;string&gt; cancel_button_text: &quot;Cancel&quot;; ... } </code></pre> <p>‚Ä¶and use it as</p> <pre><code>export component PopupBase inherits PopupWindow { in-out property &lt;string&gt; ok_text &lt;=&gt; Translations.ok_button_text; ... } </code></pre> <p>then, when changing the language or launching the application, all these attributes are updated in such a way:</p> <pre><code>app.global::&lt;Callabler&gt;().on_changed_language(move || { let app = a.upgrade().unwrap(); let translation = app.global::&lt;Translations&gt;(); translation.set_ok_button_text(flk!(&quot;ok_button&quot;).into()); translation.set_cancel_button_text(flk!(&quot;cancel_button&quot;).into()); ... }); </code></pre> <p>With over 200 texts to translate, it‚Äôs very easy to make a mistake or leave some translations unlinked, which is why I rely on Python helper scripts that verify everything is being used.</p> <p>This adds more code than if built-in support for fluent-rs existed and could be used directly, similar to how gettext translations currently work. I hope that something like this will be implemented for Fluent soon:</p> <pre><code>export component PopupBase inherits PopupWindow { in-out property &lt;string&gt; ok_text: u/tr(&quot;ok_button&quot;); ... } </code></pre> <p>Regarding the translations themselves, they are hosted and updated on Crowdin ‚Äî <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/czkawka">https://crowdin.com/project/czkawka</a> ‚Äî and synchronized with GitHub from time to time. For each release, several dozen phrases are updated, so I‚Äôm forced to use machine translation for some languages. Not all texts may be fully translated or look as they should, so feel free to correct them if you come across any mistakes.</p> <h1>Improving Krokiet</h1> <p>The main goal of this version was to reduce the feature gaps between Czkawka (GUI) and Krokiet, so that I could confidently recommend Krokiet as a viable alternative. I think I largely succeeded in this area.</p> <p>During this process, it often turned out that implementing the same features in Slint is much simpler than it was in the GTK version. Take sorting as an example. On the GTK side, due to the lack of better-known solutions (there probably are some, but I‚Äôve lived until now in complete ignorance, which makes my eyes hurt when I look at the final implementation I once made), to sort a model, I would get an iterator over it and then iterate through each element one by one, collecting the TreeIters into a vector. Then I would extract the data from a specific column of each row and sort it using bubble sort within that vector.</p> <pre><code>fn popover_sort_general&lt;T&gt;(tree_view: &amp;gtk4::TreeView, column_sort: i32, column_header: i32) where T: Ord + for&lt;&#39;b&gt; glib::value::FromValue&lt;&#39;b&gt; + &#39;static + Debug, { let model = get_list_store(tree_view); if let Some(curr_iter) = model.iter_first() { assert!(model.get::&lt;bool&gt;(&amp;curr_iter, column_header)); // First item should be header assert!(model.iter_next(&amp;curr_iter)); // Must be at least two items loop { let mut iters = Vec::new(); let mut all_have = false; loop { if model.get::&lt;bool&gt;(&amp;curr_iter, column_header) { assert!(model.iter_next(&amp;curr_iter), &quot;Empty header, this should not happens&quot;); break; } iters.push(curr_iter); if !model.iter_next(&amp;curr_iter) { all_have = true; break; } } if iters.len() == 1 { continue; // Can be equal 1 in reference folders } sort_iters::&lt;T&gt;(&amp;model, iters, column_sort); if all_have { break; } } } } fn sort_iters&lt;T&gt;(model: &amp;ListStore, mut iters: Vec&lt;TreeIter&gt;, column_sort: i32) where T: Ord + for&lt;&#39;b&gt; glib::value::FromValue&lt;&#39;b&gt; + &#39;static + Debug, { assert!(iters.len() &gt;= 2); loop { let mut changed_item = false; for idx in 0..(iters.len() - 1) { if model.get::&lt;T&gt;(&amp;iters[idx], column_sort) &gt; model.get::&lt;T&gt;(&amp;iters[idx + 1], column_sort) { model.swap(&amp;iters[idx], &amp;iters[idx + 1]); iters.swap(idx, idx + 1); changed_item = true; } } if !changed_item { return; } } } </code></pre> <p>Over time, I‚Äôve realized that I should have wrapped the model management logic earlier, which would have made reading and modifying it much easier. But now, it‚Äôs too late to make changes. On the Slint side, the situation is much simpler and more ‚ÄúRust-like‚Äù:</p> <pre><code>pub(super) fn sort_modification_date(model: &amp;ModelRc&lt;MainListModel&gt;, active_tab: ActiveTab) -&gt; ModelRc&lt;MainListModel&gt; { let sort_function = |e: &amp;MainListModel| { let modification_date_col = active_tab.get_int_modification_date_idx(); let val_int = e.val_int.iter().collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(); connect_i32_into_u64(val_int[modification_date_col], val_int[modification_date_col + 1]) }; let mut items = model.iter().collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(); items.sort_by_cached_key(&amp;sort_function); let new_model = ModelRc::new(VecModel::from(items)); recalculate_small_selection_if_needed(&amp;new_model, active_tab); return new_model; } </code></pre> <p>It‚Äôs much shorter, more readable, and in most cases faster (the GTK version might be faster if the data is already almost sorted). Still, a few oddities remain, such as:</p> <ul> <li><strong>modification_date_col</strong> ‚Äîto generalize the model for different tools a bit, for each row in the scan results, there are vectors containing numeric and string data. The amount and order of data differs for each tool, so it‚Äôs necessary to fetch from the current tab where the needed data currently resides</li> <li><strong>connect_i32_into_u64 ‚Äî</strong> as the name suggests, it combines two i32 values into a u64. This is a workaround for the fact that Slint doesn‚Äôt yet support 64-bit integers (though I‚Äôm hopeful that support will be added soon).</li> <li><strong>recalculate_small_selection_if_needed ‚Äî</strong> due to the lack of built-in widgets with multi-selection support in Slint (unlike GTK), I had to create such a widget along with all the logic for selecting items, modifying selections, etc. It adds quite a bit of extra code, but at least I now have more control over selection, which comes in handy in certain situations</li> </ul> <p>Another useful feature that already existed in Czkawka is the ability to start a scan, along with a list of selected folders, directly from the CLI. So now, running</p> <pre><code>krokiet . Desktop -i /home/rafal/Downloads -e /home/rafal/Downloads/images </code></pre> <p>will start scanning for files in three folders with one excluded (of course, only if the paths exist ‚Äî otherwise, the path will be ignored). This mode uses a separate configuration file, which is loaded when the program is run with command-line arguments (configurations for other modes are not overwritten).</p> <p>Since some things are easier to implement in Krokiet, I added several functions in this version that were missing in Czkawka:</p> <ul> <li>Remembering window size and column widths for each screen</li> <li>The ability to hide text on icons (for a more compact UI)</li> <li>Dark and light themes, switchable at runtime</li> <li>Disabling certain buttons when no items are selected</li> <li>Displaying the number of items queued for deletion</li> </ul> <h1>Ending AppImage Support</h1> <p>Following the end of Snap support on Linux in the previous version, due to difficulties in building them, it‚Äôs now time to drop AppImage as well.</p> <p>The main reasons for discontinuing AppImage are the nonstandard errors that would appear during use and its limited utility beyond what regular binary files provide.</p> <p>Personally, I‚Äôm a fan of the AppImage format and use it whenever possible (unless the application is also available as a Flatpak or Snap), since it eliminates the need to worry about external dependencies. This works great for applications with a large number of dependencies. However, in Czkawka, the only dependencies bundled were GTK4 libraries ‚Äî which didn‚Äôt make much sense, as almost every Linux distribution already has these libraries installed, often with patches to improve compatibility (for example, Debian patches: <a href="https://udd.debian.org/patches.cgi?src=gtk4&amp;version=4.18.6%2Bds-2">https://sources.debian.org/src/gtk4/4.18.6%2Bds-2/debian/patches/series/</a>).</p> <p>It would make more sense to bundle optional libraries such as ffmpeg, libheif or libraw, but I didn‚Äôt have the time or interest to do that. Occasionally, some AppImage users started reporting issues that did not appear in other formats and could not be reproduced, making them impossible to diagnose and fix.</p> <p>Additionally, the plugin itself (<a href="https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk">https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-gtk</a>) used to bundle GTK dependencies hadn‚Äôt been updated in over two years. Its authors did a fantastic job creating and maintaining it in their free time, but a major issue for me was that it wasn‚Äôt officially supported by the GTK developers, who could have assisted with the development of this very useful project.</p> <h1>Multithreaded File Processing in Krokiet and CLI</h1> <p>Some users pointed out that deleting or copying files from within the application is time-consuming, and there is no feedback on progress. Additionally, during these operations, the entire GUI becomes unresponsive until the process finishes.</p> <p>The problem stems from performing file operations in the same thread as the GUI rendering. Without interface updates, the system considers the application unresponsive and may display an os window prompting the user to kill it.</p> <p>The solution is relatively straightforward ‚Äî simply move the computations to a separate thread. However, this introduces two new challenges: the need to stop the file-processing task and to synchronize the state of completed operations with the GUI.</p> <p>A simple implementation in this style is sufficient:</p> <pre><code>let all_files = files.len(); let mut processing_files = Arc&lt;AtomicBool&lt;usize&gt;&gt;::new(0); let _ = files.into_par_iter().map(|e| { if stop_flag.load(Ordering::Relaxed) { return None; } let processing_files = processing_files.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed); let status_to_send = Status { all_files, processing_files }; progress_sender.send(status_to_send); // Processing file }).while_some().collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;(); </code></pre> <p>The problem arises when a large number of messages are being sent, and updating the GUI/terminal for each of them would be completely unnecessary ‚Äî after all, very few people could notice and process status changes appearing even 60 times per second.</p> <p>This would also cause performance issues and unnecessarily increase system resource usage. I needed a way to limit the number of messages being sent. This could be implemented either on the side of the message generator (the thread deleting files) or on the recipient side (the GUI thread/progress bar in CLI). I decided it‚Äôs better to handle it sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Ultimately, I created a simple structure that uses a lock to store the latest message to be sent. Then, in a separate thread, every ~100 ms, the message is fetched and sent to the GUI. Although the solution is simple, I do have some concerns about its performance on systems with a very large number of cores ‚Äî there, thousands or even tens of thousands of messages per second could cause the mutex to become a bottleneck.

Even so, differences can be noticed, stemming both from personal design preferences and limitations of the libraries that both projects use(for example, in the Tauri version popups are used more often, because Slint has issues with them, so I avoided using them whenever possible).</p> <p>Since I am not very skilled in application design, it‚Äôs not surprising that I found several interesting solutions in this new GUI that I will want to either copy 1:1 or use as inspiration when modifying Krokiet.</p> <p>Preliminary tests indicate that the application works surprisingly well, despite minor performance issues (one mode on Windows froze briefly ‚Äî though the culprit might also be the czkawka_core package), small GUI shortcomings (e.g., the ability to save the application as an HTML page), or the lack of a working Linux version (a month or two ago I managed to compile it, but now I cannot).</p> <p>Link ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/shixinhuang99/czkawka-tauri">https://github.com/shixinhuang99/czkawka-tauri</a></p> <h1>Czkawka in the Debian Repository</h1> <p>Recently, just before the release of Debian 13, a momentous event took place ‚Äî Czkawka 8.0.0 was added to the Debian repository (even though version 9.0.0 already existed, but well‚Ä¶ Debian has a preference for older, more stable versions, and that must be respected). The addition was made by user Fab Stz.</p> <p>Links:<br/> - <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/czkawka-gui">https://packages.debian.org/sid/czkawka-gui</a><br/> - <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/czkawka-cli">https://packages.debian.org/sid/czkawka-cli</a></p> <p>Debian takes reproducible builds very seriously, so it quickly became apparent that building Czkawka twice in the same environment produced two different binaries. I managed to reduce the problematic program to a few hundred lines. In my great wisdom (or naivety, assuming the bug wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúbetween the chair and the keyboard‚Äù), I concluded that the problem must be in Rust itself. However, after analysis conducted by others, it turned out that the culprit was the <code>i18n-cargo-fl</code> library, whose proc-macro iterates over a hashmap of arguments, and in Rust the iteration order in such a case is random (<a href="https://github.com/kellpossible/cargo-i18n/issues/150">https://github.com/kellpossible/cargo-i18n/issues/150</a>).</p> <p>With the source of the problem identified, I prepared a fix ‚Äî <a href="https://github.com/kellpossible/cargo-i18n/pull/151">https://github.com/kellpossible/cargo-i18n/pull/151</a> ‚Äî which has already been merged and is part of the new 0.10.0 version of the <code>cargo-i18n</code> library. Debian‚Äôs repository still uses version 0.9.3, but with this fix applied. Interestingly, <code>cargo-i18n</code> is also used in many other projects, including applications from <strong>Cosmic DE</strong>, so they too now have an easier path to achieving fully reproducible builds.</p> <h1>Compilation Times and Binary Size</h1> <p>I have never hidden the fact that I gladly use external libraries to easily extend the capabilities of an application, so I don‚Äôt have to waste time reinventing the wheel in a process that is both inefficient and error-prone.</p> <p>Despite many obvious advantages, the biggest downsides are larger binary sizes and longer compilation times. On my older laptop with 4 weak cores, compilation times became so long that I stopped developing this program on it.</p> <p>However, this doesn‚Äôt mean I use additional libraries without consideration. I often try to standardize dependency versions or use projects that are actively maintained and update the libraries they depend on ‚Äî for example, rawler instead of rawloader, or image-hasher instead of img-hash (which I created as a fork of img-hash with updated dependencies).</p> <p>To verify the issue of long compilation times, I generated several charts showing how long Krokiet takes to compile with different options, how large the binary is after various optimizations, and how long a recompilation takes after adding a comment (I didn‚Äôt test binary performance, as that is a more complicated matter). This allowed me to consider which options were worth including in CI. After reviewing the results, I decided it was worth switching from the current configuration‚Äî <strong><em>release + thin lto</em></strong> to <strong><em>release + fat lto + codegen units = 1</em></strong> .</p> <p>The tests were conducted on a 12-core AMD Ryzen 9 9700 running Ubuntu 25.04, using the mold linker and rustc 1.91.0-nightly (cd7cbe818 2025‚Äì08‚Äì15). The base profiles were debug and release, and I adjusted some options based on them (not all combinations seemed worth testing, and some caused various errors) to see their impact on compilation. It‚Äôs important to note that Krokiet is a rather specific project with many dependencies, and Slint that generates a large (~100k lines) Rust file, so other projects may experience significantly different compilation times.</p> <p>Test Results:</p> <pre><code>|Config | Output File Size | Target Folder Size | Compilation Time | Rebuild Time | |:---------------------------------------------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------|:---------------| | release + overflow checks | 73.49 MiB | 2.07 GiB | 1m 11s | 20s | | debug | 1004.52 MiB | 7.00 GiB | 1m 54s | 3s | | debug + cranelift | 624.43 MiB | 5.25 GiB | 47s | 3s | | debug + debug disabled | 131.64 MiB | 2.52 GiB | 1m 33s | 2s | | check | - | 1.66 GiB | 58s | 1s | | release | 70.50 MiB | 2.04 GiB | 2m 58s | 2m 11s | | release + cranelift | 70.50 MiB | 2.04 GiB | 2m 59s | 2m 10s | | release + debug info | 786.19 MiB | 5.40 GiB | 3m 23s | 2m 18s | | release + native | 67.22 MiB | 1.98 GiB | 3m 5s | 2m 13s | | release + opt o2 | 70.09 MiB | 2.04 GiB | 2m 56s | 2m 9s | | release + opt o1 | 76.55 MiB | 1.98 GiB | 1m 1s | 18s | | release + thin lto | 63.77 MiB | 2.06 GiB | 3m 12s | 2m 32s | | release + optimize size | 66.93 MiB | 1.93 GiB | 1m 1s | 18s | | release + fat lto | 45.46 MiB | 2.03 GiB | 6m 18s | 5m 38s | | release + cu 1 | 50.93 MiB | 1.92 GiB | 4m 9s | 2m 56s | | release + panic abort | 56.81 MiB | 1.97 GiB | 2m 56s | 2m 15s | | release + build-std | 70.72 MiB | 2.23 GiB | 3m 7s | 2m 11s | | release + fat lto + cu 1 + panic abort | 35.71 MiB | 1.92 GiB | 5m 44s | 4m 47s | | release + fat lto + cu 1 + panic abort + native | 35.94 MiB | 1.87 GiB | 6m 23s | 5m 24s | | release + fat lto + cu 1 + panic abort + build-std | 33.97 MiB | 2.11 GiB | 5m 45s | 4m 44s | | release + fat lto + cu 1 | 40.65 MiB | 1.95 GiB | 6m 3s | 5m 2s | | release + incremental | 71.45 MiB | 2.38 GiB | 1m 8s | 2s | | release + incremental + fat lto | 44.81 MiB | 2.44 GiB | 4m 25s | 3m 36s | </code></pre> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/berst4cwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105c9aa505e987bac5af2953e7c04501e67b0745">https://preview.redd.it/berst4cwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=105c9aa505e987bac5af2953e7c04501e67b0745</a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/8i9oj4cwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2422d7ca4ea62fa6d4bce6bb2d547efd8e8f7c">https://preview.redd.it/8i9oj4cwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2422d7ca4ea62fa6d4bce6bb2d547efd8e8f7c</a></p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/rwuz06bwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6828724a0bf6d50f7fa619f5ed306d587853ac44">https://preview.redd.it/rwuz06bwfsjf1.png?width=3600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6828724a0bf6d50f7fa619f5ed306d587853ac44</a></p> <p>Some things that surprised me:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>build-std</em></strong> increases, rather than decreases, the binary size</li> <li><strong><em>optimize-size</em></strong> is fast but only slightly reduces the final binary size.</li> <li><strong><em>fat-LTO</em></strong> works much better than <strong><em>thin-LTO</em></strong> in this project, even though I often read online that <strong><em>thin-LTO</em></strong> usually gives results very similar to <strong><em>fat-LTO</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>panic-abort</em></strong> ‚Äî I thought using this option wouldn‚Äôt change the binary size much, but the file shrank by as much as 20%. However, I cannot disable this option and wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone (at least for Krokiet and Czkawka), because with external libraries that process/validate/parse external files, panics can occur, and with <strong><em>panic-abort</em></strong> they cannot be caught, so the application will just terminate instead of printing an error and continuing</li> <li><strong><em>release + incremental</em></strong> ‚Äîthis will probably become my new favorite flag, it gives release performance while keeping recompilation times similar to debug.

There&#39;s still a gap to TS and Go and such, but its closing rapidly, and the contributors and maintainers have moved the DX squarely into the &quot;whoa, this works really well&quot; zone.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While documenting my first &quot;serious&quot; Rust project, I found it hard to write introductory documentation that showcased the thing, while assuring myself that the code would actually compile / work.</p> <p>Hence <code>rsticle</code>: It takes a source file, adorned with special line comments, and produces a markup document that showcases the code. So it turns this:</p> <pre><code>//: # A basic Rust Example //: //: This file will showcase the following function: //: //&gt; ____ pub fn strlen&lt;&#39;a&gt;(s: &amp;&#39;a str) -&gt; usize { s.len() } //: //{ #[test] fn test_strlen() { //} //: It works as expected: //: assert_eq!(strlen(&quot;Hello world!&quot;), 12); } // </code></pre> <p>into this:</p> <pre><code># A basic Rust Example This file will showcase the following function: pub fn strlen&lt;&#39;a&gt;(s: &amp;&#39;a str) -&gt; usize { s.len() } It works as expected: assert_eq!(strlen(&quot;Hello world!&quot;), 12); </code></pre> <p>There are only 5 special kinds of comments. See the README on the <a href="https://codeberg.org/wldmr/rsticle/">project page</a> for details. They are configurable, so they&#39;ll work with any language that has line comments.</p> <p>You can use the tool in three ways:</p> <ul> <li><p>as a Rust libaray (<code>cargo add rsticle</code>)</p></li> <li><p>as a command line tool (<code>cargo install rsticle-cli</code> or prebuilt binaries)</p></li> <li><p>as a proc macro: (<code>cargo add rsticle-rustdoc</code>)</p></li> </ul> <p>Example for using the macro:</p> <pre><code>//! Highly advanced string length calculation //! //! Get a load of this: #![doc = rsticle_rustdoc::include_as_doc!(&quot;examples/basic.rs&quot;)] </code></pre> <p>That last one is the main reason I built this, but the command line tool might come in handy for writing things like blog articles that essentially walk you through a file top to bottom.</p> <p>Hope it&#39;s something you&#39;ll find useful. It&#39;s early days, so feedback is appreciated.</p> <p>Edit: <code>cargo install rsticle</code> doesn&#39;t work.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>I know, I know‚Ä¶ &quot;Go doesn&#39;t need DI frameworks.&quot; I said the same thing for years. Then my startup&#39;s API grew to 30+ services, and I was spending more time wiring dependencies than writing features.</p> <p>Every new feature looked like: update 5 constructors, fix 10 test files, debug ordering issues, realize I forgot to pass the logger somewhere, start over. Sound familiar?</p> <p>So I built godi to solve actual problems I was hitting every day.</p> <p>My main.go was 100 lines of this:</p> <pre><code>config := loadConfig() logger := newLogger(config) db := newDatabase(config, logger) cache := newCache(config, logger) userRepo := newUserRepo(db, logger) orderRepo := newOrderRepo(db, logger) emailService := newEmailService(config, logger) userService := newUserService(userRepo, emailService, cache, logger) orderService := newOrderService(orderRepo, userService, emailService, cache, logger) // ... many more services </code></pre> <p>Want to add caching? Time to update 20 constructors, their tests, and hope you got the initialization order right.</p> <p>With godi, it&#39;s just:</p> <pre><code>services := godi.NewCollection() services.AddSingleton(loadConfig) services.AddSingleton(newLogger) services.AddSingleton(newDatabase) services.AddScoped(newUserService) services.AddScoped(newOrderService) // Order doesn&#39;t matter - godi figures it out provider, _ := services.Build() orderService, _ := godi.Resolve[*OrderService](provider) // Everything wired automatically </code></pre> <h1>The game changer: Three lifetime scopes</h1> <p>This is what actually makes it powerful:</p> <pre><code>services.AddSingleton(NewDatabase) // One instance forever services.AddScoped(NewUserContext) // New instance per request services.AddTransient(NewRequestID) // New instance every time </code></pre> <p>In practice:</p> <pre><code>http.HandleFunc(&quot;/users&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { scope, _ := provider.CreateScope(r.Context()) defer scope.Close() // Every service in THIS request shares the same UserContext // Next request gets fresh instances userService, _ := godi.Resolve[*UserService](scope) }) </code></pre> <p>No more threading context through 15 function calls. No more globals. Each request gets its own isolated world.</p> <h1>Your code doesn&#39;t change</h1> <pre><code>func NewOrderService( repo OrderRepository, users UserService, email EmailService, ) OrderService { return &amp;orderService{repo, users, email} } </code></pre> <p>Just regular constructors. No tags, no magic. Add a parameter? godi automatically injects it everywhere.</p> <h1>Modules keep it organized</h1> <pre><code>var RepositoryModule = godi.NewModule(&quot;repository&quot;, godi.AddScoped(NewUserRepository), godi.AddScoped(NewUserService), ) services.AddModules(RepositoryModule) // Pull in everything </code></pre> <h1>Is this for you?</h1> <p>You don&#39;t need this for a 10 file project. But when you have 30+ services, complex dependency graphs, and need request isolation for web APIs? Manual wiring becomes a nightmare.</p> <p>Using this in production on a ~50k LOC codebase. Adding new services went from &quot;ugh, wiring&quot; to just writing the constructor.</p> <p>Would love to hear how others handle dependency injection at scale. Are you all just more disciplined than me with manual wiring? Using wire? Rolling your own factories? And if you try godi, let me know what sucks. Still actively working on it.</p> <p><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/junioryono/godi">github.com/junioryono/godi</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ameryono"> /u/ameryono </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mt9clj/how_i_went_from_hating_di_frameworks_to_building/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mt9clj/how_i_went_from_hating_di_frameworks_to_building/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Think it‚Äôs really coming together, the idea is to build something along the lines of OG Caves of Qud, but more focused on story telling and less on being a roguelike.

Also working on a self propagating status system that will handle things like curses and fire spreading across entities. Obviously have a discord and a YouTube channel where I‚Äôm doing dev logs !
