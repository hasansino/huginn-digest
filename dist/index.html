After spending a few too many hours wrestling with that, I started wondering ‚Äî <em>what if converter configs were just Go code?</em> Fully type-checked, refactorable, and composable?</p> <p>So I started experimenting with something new called <a href="https://github.com/sublee/convgen"><strong>Convgen</strong></a>. It&#39;s still early stage, but it tries to bring goverter&#39;s idea closer to how Go tooling actually works:</p> <ul> <li>Automatic type conversions by codegen</li> <li>Refactor-safe configuration</li> <li>Batched diagnostics</li> </ul> <p>For example, this code:</p> <pre><code>// source: var EncodeUser = convgen.Struct[User, api.User](nil, convgen.RenameReplace(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Id&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;), // Replace Id with ID in output types before matching convgen.Match(User{}.Name, api.User{}.Username), // Explicit field matching ) </code></pre> <p>will be rewritten as:</p> <pre><code>// generated: (simplified) func EncodeUser(in User) (out api.User) { out.Id = in.ID out.Username = in.Name out.Email = in.Email return } </code></pre> <p>It&#39;s been working surprisingly well for my test projects, but it&#39;s still a baby. <strong>I&#39;d love feedback or crazy edge cases to test.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sublee"> /u/sublee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/sublee/convgen">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o27t71/goverter_is_great_but_refactoring_it_almost_broke/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

Generally speaking, once you have an async + runtime-agnostic implementation, you can immediately have a sync implementation by block_on any async runtime (<a href="https://github.com/zesterer/pollster"><code>pollster</code></a> is the most lightweight runtime that parks the current thread). However, a sync-oriented implementation may leverage some platform-specific features to achieve better performance. This library is designed for async code, so it doesn&#39;t consider sync-oriented optimization. I often find libraries that try to provide both sync and async implementations end up with a clumsy API design. So I prefer to keep them separate.</p> <p>Currently, most async Rust software depends on tokio for all of:</p> <ul> <li>Async tasks scheduler</li> <li>Async IO/Timer driver</li> <li>Async primitives</li> <li>Async combinators (AsyncReadExt, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Theoretically, all concepts above are independent of one another. And with proper standard API design, they can decouple each other and cooperate in an orthogonal manner.</p> <p>Tokio&#39;s sync primitives are runtime-agnostic; having a dedicated home for these primitives can clarify their purpose and provide a focused environment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tison1096"> /u/tison1096 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o2lhab/request_for_comment_a_runtimeagnostic_library/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o2lhab/request_for_comment_a_runtimeagnostic_library/">[comments]</a></span></div>

However, in the conversation of &quot;users complain but don&#39;t contribute&quot;, I think my experience is clear evidence/validation for the sentiment &quot;why try to contribute if it won&#39;t be looked at&quot;. <strong>On top of that</strong>, near the end of 2023, something about the toolchain changed that made running a locally built rustfmt with your own fixes particularly difficult (maybe it&#39;s easier again), so that&#39;s <em>especially</em> discouraging for potential contributors</p> <p>In my use case, this crash was triggered by a combination of the settings <code>hard_tabs</code>, <code>max_width</code>, <code>error_on_unformatted</code>, and <code>error_on_line_overflow</code>. Most files don&#39;t trigger it, but in a sufficiently large code base, it happens quite frequently.

Maintainers are understandably busy; I thank them for the update and say I&#39;ll keep an eye on things.</li> <li>(Fuzzy) Around the end of 2023, some stuff changed that made it quite hard to use a locally built rustfmt. It&#39;s a PITA but I get some hack working.</li> <li>2024 March 18: I ask again &quot;Request for review of old PR?&quot; since I&#39;m still repeatedly running into this crash on my code. I&#39;m told that there&#39;s a related fix in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/pull/6084">#6084</a> submitted in 2024 February; it appears that the panic can also be triggered by mismatching byte/char indices. I didn&#39;t check if this PR fixes the issue with tabs, since if I need to use a local hack anyways, my current fix is sufficient for myself.</li> <li>2024 November: related(?) PR <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/pull/6391">#6391</a> is submitted.</li> <li>2025 January: #6391 is accepted. I haven&#39;t checked if that fixes the tab issue since I stopped working in rust.</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;ll admit/if it wasn&#39;t already obvious that I&#39;m a bit salty at the whole process, especially because I had a somewhat similar experience trying to submit a library PR with some almost trivial constification changes that I actually needed/would have used in my own code. However, if you read my PR and comments in Zulip, I think I&#39;ve been nothing but friendly to and understanding of the maintainers.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what I said in my 2023 June 19 zulip post:</p> <blockquote> <p>Hello!

I&#39;ve been working for a few months now on a library to generate static websites called Maudit.</p> <p>What I mean by &quot;a library&quot; instead of a framework is that a Maudit project is a normal Rust project, pages are normal Rust structs and so on.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As far as I know, the reason why movable self-referential types are unsound is because of those references becoming invalid when moves happen. In that case, couldn&#39;t there be a Move trait, that hooked onto the moves made by the compiler (similar to drop, but after the move), and which had one function, on_move, that allowed the implementor to update the self references right after every move. Of course, the implementation would be unsafe, and there would need to be a way to say &quot;self reference&quot;, so I suppose a specially named lifetime (although I don&#39;t think &#39;self is available).</p> <p>Is this proposal any good? It sounds too simple to both be a solution and not having been proposed before. In any case, I just thought it could be useful, and it comes with guarantees of soundness (I hope).</p> <p>One example of this (not a good one, I just never had to use self referential types, the point isn&#39;t that this self referential type is dumb, which I know it is, just to give an example of usage since I don&#39;t work with them)</p> <p><code>rust struct ByteSliceWithSection&lt;const N: usize&gt; { data: [u8, N], first_half: &amp;&#39;auto [u8], } </code></p> <p>This wouldn&#39;t compile with a message along the lines of &quot;Self-referential type doesn&#39;t implement Move&quot;.</p> <p>I suppose Move itself isn&#39;t an unsafe trait, since maybe you do want to do things always on move on a non self referential type (debugging purposes, I suppose?)</p> <p>Then it would be: <code> impl&lt;const N: usize&gt; Move for ByteSliceWithSection&lt;N&gt; { fn move(&amp;mut self) { // SAFETY: updating a self reference after a move, making it valid again. unsafe { self.first_half = self[..(N/2)] } } } </code> I don&#39;t think this would affect Send-ness, maybe Sync-ness but I think not, either.</p> <p>Move would also be called on copy, if the type implements copy. I think it should be called on struct construction. Self referential fields would not be initialized in struct initializers but instead all of them need to be initialized in that move function (not initializing one of them would incur a compilation error, maybe?).</p> <p>And I think that&#39;s all for the proposal, I&#39;m sorry if it&#39;s been made before, though, and I hope it wasn&#39;t too unsound. I think forcing self referential fields to be updated in the move function (or some other language construct) would make it more sound, (that and treating them as not initialized inside the function until they are, so there&#39;s no accessible invalid data at any point).</p> <p>Update: The original example didn&#39;t make sense, and now I&#39;m adding the restriction of the reference must point to inside the structure, always. Otherwise it would have to trigger at, for example, vec growth.</p> <p>Update 2: Another option would be making the mutation of the self referenced fields unsafe, and it&#39;s the job of the implementor to make sure it&#39;s sound. So, in case of a self referential type that references the data in a vec, modifying the vec would be unsafe but there could be safe wrappers around it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sylbeth04"> /u/Sylbeth04 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o20u4w/about_selfreferential_types_possible/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o20u4w/about_selfreferential_types_possible/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Looking for ideas here, or the possibility that I&#39;m missing something incredibly obvious. Scenario:</p> <p>I have a microservice written in Rust; I want to add some basic level of APM to it. I&#39;m using OpenTelemetry and Signoz, and have managed to get a baseline working using the <code>tracing</code> and <code>opentelemetry</code>/<code>opentelemetry-otlp</code> crates. So I have spans for all my own code working just fine.</p> <p>Next step is I really want external service calls monitored. I understand I can do this when I create my own Reqwest clients by adding a middleware at client creation (<code>reqwest-tracing</code> would seem to do the job, although I&#39;ve not tried it yet...)</p> <p>BUT, the reality is I&#39;m not doing a lot with Reqwest directly myself, I&#39;m using client library crates - whether it&#39;s for a NoSQL database server or a public API, in general I&#39;m using an (official where possible) client crate. And while most of these do tend to use Reqwest under the bonnet, they also by and large aren&#39;t doing any tracing, or giving me a way to &#39;get at&#39; their internal Reqwest client instance to add a middleware.</p> <p>Is there any obvious way I&#39;m missing to &#39;inject&#39; the tracing into 3rd party crates? This is pretty COTS functionality needed for building microservices, so maybe there is an obvious thing I&#39;m missing?</p> <p>Right now my best idea is forking the client libraries I use to add a <code>features = [&quot;tracing&quot;]</code> myself...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Clank75"> /u/Clank75 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o20gp8/apm_with_rust_tracing_external_service_calls_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o20gp8/apm_with_rust_tracing_external_service_calls_in/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>TL;DR: 42B parameter models now run on 8GB GPUs</h1> <p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy/releases/tag/v1.7.0">Shimmy v1.7.0</a> with MoE CPU offloading, and holy shit the memory savings are real.</p> <p><strong>Before:</strong> &quot;I need a $10,000 A100 to run Phi-3.5-MoE&quot;<br/> <strong>After:</strong> &quot;It&#39;s running on my RTX 4070&quot; ü§Ø</p> <h1>Real numbers (not marketing BS)</h1> <p>I actually measured these with proper tooling:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Phi-3.5-MoE 42B</strong>: 4GB VRAM instead of 80GB+</li> <li><strong>GPT-OSS 20B</strong>: 71.5% VRAM reduction (15GB ‚Üí 4.3GB)</li> <li><strong>DeepSeek-MoE 16B</strong>: Down to 800MB with aggressive quantization</li> </ul> <p>Yeah, it&#39;s 2-7x slower. But it <strong>actually runs</strong> instead of OOMing.</p> <h1>How it works</h1> <p>MoE (Mixture of Experts) models have tons of &quot;expert&quot; layers, but only use a few at a time. So we:</p> <ol> <li>Keep active computation on GPU (fast)</li> <li>Store unused experts on CPU/RAM (cheap)</li> <li>Swap as needed (magic happens)</li> </ol> <h1>Ready to try it?</h1> <pre><code># Install (it&#39;s on crates.io!) cargo install shimmy # I made a bunch of optimized models for this huggingface-cli download MikeKuykendall/phi-3.5-moe-q4-k-m-cpu-offload-gguf # Run it ./shimmy serve --cpu-moe --model-path phi-3.5-moe-q4-k-m.gguf </code></pre> <p>OpenAI-compatible API, so your existing code Just Works‚Ñ¢.</p> <h1>Model recommendations</h1> <p>I uploaded 9 different variants so you can pick based on your hardware:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Got 8GB VRAM?</strong> ‚Üí Phi-3.5-MoE Q8.0 (maximum quality)</li> <li><strong>4GB VRAM?</strong> ‚Üí DeepSeek-MoE Q4 K-M (solid performance)</li> <li><strong>Potato GPU?</strong> ‚Üí DeepSeek-MoE Q2 K (800MB VRAM, still decent)</li> <li><strong>First time?</strong> ‚Üí Phi-3.5-MoE Q4 K-M (best balance)</li> </ul> <p>All models: <a href="https://huggingface.co/MikeKuykendall">https://huggingface.co/MikeKuykendall</a></p> <h1>Cross-platform binaries</h1> <ul> <li>Windows (CUDA support)</li> <li>macOS (Metal + MLX)</li> <li>Linux x86_64 + ARM64</li> </ul> <p>Still a tiny 5MB binary with zero Python bloat.</p> <h1>Why this is actually important</h1> <p>This isn&#39;t just a cool demo. It&#39;s about <strong>democratizing AI access</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Students</strong>: Run SOTA models on laptops</li> <li><strong>Researchers</strong>: Prototype without cloud bills</li> <li><strong>Companies</strong>: Deploy on existing hardware</li> <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Keep data on-premises</li> </ul> <p>The technique leverages existing llama.cpp work, but I built the Rust bindings, packaging, and curated model collection to make it actually usable for normal people.</p> <h1>Questions I expect</h1> <p><strong>Q: Is this just quantization?</strong><br/> A: No, it&#39;s architectural. We&#39;re moving computation between CPU/GPU dynamically.</p> <p><strong>Q: How slow is &quot;2-7x slower&quot;?</strong><br/> A: Still interactive for most use cases. Think 10-20 tokens/sec instead of 50-100.</p> <p><strong>Q: Does this work with other models?</strong><br/> A: Any MoE model supported by llama.cpp. I just happen to have curated ones ready.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why not just use Ollama?</strong><br/> A: Ollama doesn&#39;t have MoE CPU offloading. This is the first production implementation in a user-friendly package.</p> <p>Been working on this for weeks and I&#39;m pretty excited about the implications. Happy to answer questions!</p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy">https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmy</a><br/> Models: <a href="https://huggingface.co/MikeKuykendall">https://huggingface.co/MikeKuykendall</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/targetedwebresults"> /u/targetedwebresults </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o1wira/just_shipped_shimmy_v170_run_42b_models_on_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o1wira/just_shipped_shimmy_v170_run_42b_models_on_your/">[comments]</a></span></div>
