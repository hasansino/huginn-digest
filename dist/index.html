            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve dabbled in developing little prototypes in unity on and off for a while. It&#39;s something I&#39;d love to truly get in to. Being a software engineer by trade, I adore coding and can find myself around OOP languages fairly easy and enjoy it. However, I find myself losing motivation when it comes to the art aspect of development (IE. Asset creation) as I find learning what is essentially a completely new set of skills daunting due to lack of spare time. My &quot;prototypes&quot; never leave the &quot;cubes moving on cuboid platform stages&quot;.</p> <p>For any solo Devs who specialise in the programming aspect of game dev, how do you go about overcoming the art obstacle? Do you just learn anyway? Outsource to someone else? Asset store?</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear other people&#39;s thoughts on the matter, for a bit of motivation if nothing else.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThatCarlosGuy"> /u/ThatCarlosGuy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwk7po/solo_game_development_as_a_programmer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwk7po/solo_game_development_as_a_programmer/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a SE with 11 years of experience in backend development and I&#39;ve been making a 2d pixel graphics Bullet Haven game like vampire survivors. (How original am I right?) </p> <p>I came into this project knowing it won&#39;t do very well commercially, but I wanted to start my game dev journey with a genre I&#39;m fairly familiar with and a project I could finish. When I&#39;m done I am going to put my game on steam, for the personal accomplishment of a &quot;complete&quot; product. I don&#39;t know that I necessarily want to spent money marketing it, but the &quot;practice&quot; of marketing it might be worthwhile for my next game, since it&#39;s not something I&#39;m familiar with. </p> <p>My game isn&#39;t amazing, I&#39;m mostly using it to learn things (procedurally generated terrain/maps, hitboxes, making skill trees, making SFX, saving game states, enemy attack patterns, etc). I&#39;ve been working on this game for several hours a day for about 3 months. I&#39;m not great at art, so about 60% of the assets are free use one&#39;s that I&#39;ve found online(terrain and enemy sprites), 25% I&#39;ve made myself (player character, UI, attack projectiles), and 15% are AI (the static image skill icons in my skill tree, if I decide to associate a cost with my game, I&#39;ll pay someone to make new skill icons or try my hand at making them myself, I know AI is bad) </p> <p>I&#39;m at a point where I need to decide where the goal posts for this project should be and I don&#39;t know what to do, so I&#39;m seeking advice here from those with more solo game dev experience. I&#39;m running out of passion for this project overall, but don&#39;t know where to stop development. For example, my next project will have coop in it, so I was thinking of trying to add coop to this game to learn, but it&#39;d require an overhaul of a lot of systems. Every time I think about implementing it in this game, I&#39;m dreading the amount of work it&#39;ll be and am just itching to start my next project.</p> <p>So I guess my main questions is as solo devs, how do you guys decide where to draw the line?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/recycled_dnd"> /u/recycled_dnd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwjrf5/how_do_you_know_when_to_stop_working_on_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwjrf5/how_do_you_know_when_to_stop_working_on_your/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After around 4 years, I finally pushed the dreaded release button one month ago and wanted to take this opportunity to talk about my experiences and learnings so far.</p> <p><strong>First some context:</strong></p> <p><strong>Game Name:</strong> Evolve Lab (Asynchronous PvP auto battler)<br/> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569240/Evolve_Lab/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569240/Evolve_Lab/</a></p> <p>The game is still in early access.</p> <p><strong>Goals and prior experience:</strong><br/> I worked on this project on and off during my last three years as a computer science major and afterwards next to working full time as a software engineer. The project was meant as a hobby and passion project, so my main goal was to find and create an active community that I can share and enjoy the game with. It is also the first game that I have ever released on steam.</p> <p><strong>Numbers before release:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Wishlist: 2,977</li> <li>Demo Players: ~ 4,000 (Players that have started the demo at least once)</li> <li>Discord Users: ~ 400</li> </ul> <p><strong>Numbers one month after release:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Gross Revenue: ~ $20,000</li> <li>Units Sold: ~ 1,500</li> <li>Reviews: 56 positive / 2 negative</li> <li>Playtime: Median 1 hour 22 minutes, and average 6 hours 40 minutes</li> <li>Wishlists: 5,645</li> </ul> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>What I think went well:</strong></p> <p><strong>Playtesting often and early:</strong><br/> I started playtesting the game as soon as I had the minimal gameplay loop ready. First with friends and then I recruited players by posting to various subreddits. I also created the discord right at the beginning to start cultivating a community. Many players that I have gained during this stage are still active and have helped me a lot with visibility by posting about the game in various places. I also earned the first 10 positive reviews on launch weekend thanks to alpha players.</p> <p><strong>Demo:</strong><br/> The demo was available for three months until the release and I also participated with it in the steam next fest. I treated the demo as a continuation of playtesting, so it included everything that I had for the game up to that point. The advantage of this was that I did not have to split my community to test new content and since all progress from the demo carried over to the full release many players bought the game to continue playing. Around 25% of all sales have previously played the demo.</p> <p><strong>Content Creators:</strong> (More info for before the release here:<br/> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mvkdac/i%5C_contacted%5C_102%5C_content%5C_creators%5C_it%5C_resulted%5C_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mvkdac/i\_contacted\_102\_content\_creators\_it\_resulted\_in/</a>)</p> <p>Since the time before release was rather stressful I did not have time to contact many content creators. I followed up with all content creators who had made videos for the demo and most of them also released a video for the release. Some bigger youtubers that did not cover the demo also released videos on release day. Olexa contacted me by email for a key, and Retromation even created a video without receiving one. This was a dream come true for me since both of them are Youtubers that I watch in my free time and I never imagined them playing the game.</p> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>What I‚Äôm unsure about:</strong></p> <p><strong>Price:</strong><br/> I thought a lot about how to price the game, and in the end I settled on $15. This is the same price as Backpack battles and many other similar games. I think in the long run this pricing will make sense especially when the game leaves early access and it also allows me to do steeper discounts if I see a drop in sales. Nevertheless, I did see some comments under YouTube videos lamenting that the price was too high and think my initial conversion rate could have been better with a lower price.</p> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>What could be improved:</strong></p> <p><strong>Onboarding:</strong><br/> One negative aspect of my long playtesting period is that I already had many players with more than 100 hours into the game before release and I saw myself sometimes implementing new content and more complex mechanics that could make the game a bit overwhelming for new players. In order to combat this I have implemented a progression system that slowly introduces new content, but now some players get the initial impression that the game has less content since they stop playing after their first run.</p> <p>-------------------------------------</p> <p><strong>What could have been better:</strong></p> <p><strong>Release Marketing:</strong><br/> Because I was pressed for time I could not do a full round of content creator reachout or any other form of marketing for the release. I also did not have time to update my steam page with screenshots or a trailer for the full release. I would definitely budged in more time for marketing or hire someone to manage that aspect next time</p> <p>I hope this post could provide some insights and if you have any questions, I‚Äôm happy to answer them in the comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BEVSpinzaku"> /u/BEVSpinzaku </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwc14f/i_released_my_first_game_with_3000_wishlists_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nwc14f/i_released_my_first_game_with_3000_wishlists_it/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>COMMON HDR MYTHS BUSTED</p> <p>There&#39;s a lot of misinformation out there about what HDR is and isn&#39;t. Let&#39;s breakdown the most common myths:</p> <ul> <li><strong>HDR is better on Consoles and is broken on Windows - FALSE</strong> - They are identical in almost every game: HDR10 (BT.2020 color space + PQ encoding). Windows does display SDR content as washed out in HDR mode, but that&#39;s not a problem for games or movies.</li> <li><strong>Nvidia RTX HDR is better than then native HDR implementation - FALSE</strong> - While often the native HDR implementation of games has some defects, RTX HDR is a post process filter that expands an 8 bit SDR image into HDR; that comes with its own set of limitations, and ends up distorting the look of games (e.g. boosting saturation, making the UI extremely bright) etc.</li> <li><strong>SDR looks better, HDR looks washed out - FALSE</strong> - While some games have a bit less contrast in HDR, chances are that your TV in SDR was set to an overly saturated preset, while the HDR mode will show colors exactly as the game or movie were meant to. Additionally, some monitors had fake HDR implementations as a marketing gimmick, damaging the reputation of HDR in people&#39;s mind.</li> <li><strong>HDR will blind you - FALSE</strong> - HDR isn&#39;t about simply having a brighter image, but either way, being outdoors in the daytime will expose you to amounts of lights tens of times higher than your display could ever be, so you don&#39;t have to worry, your eyes will adjust.</li> <li><strong>The HDR standard is a mess, TVs are different and it&#39;s impossible to calibrate them - FALSE</strong> - Displays follow the HDR standards much more accurately than they ever did in SDR. It&#39;s indeed SDR that was never fully standardized and was a &quot;mess&quot;. The fact that all HDR TVs have a different peak brightness is not a problem for gamers or developers, it barely matters (a display mapping shoulder can be done in 3 lines of shader code). Games don&#39;t even really need HDR calibration menus, beside a brightness slider, all the information on the calibration is available from the system.</li> <li><strong>Who cares about HDR... Nobody has HDR displays and they are extremely expensive - FALSE</strong> - They are getting much more popular and cheaper than you might think. Most TVs sold nowadays have HDR, and the visual impact of good HDR is staggering. It&#39;s well worth investing in it if you can. It&#39;s arguably cheaper than proper Ray Tracing GPUs, and just as impactful on visuals.</li> <li><strong>If the game is washed out in HDR, doesn&#39;t it mean the devs intended it that way? - FALSE</strong> - Resources to properly develop HDR are very scarce, and devs don&#39;t spend nearly as much time as they should on it, disregarding the fact that SDR will eventually die and all that will be left is the HDR version of their games. Almost all games are still developed on SDR screens and only adapted to HDR at the very end, without the proper tools to analyze or compare HDR images. Devs are often unhappy with the HDR results themselves. In the case of Unreal Engine, devs simply enable it in the settings without any tweaks.</li> </ul> <p>You can find the full ELI5 guide to HDR usage on our HDR Den reddit (links are not allowed): r/ HDR_Den/comments/1nvmchr/hdr_the_definitive_eli5_guide/</p> <p>Given that people asked, here&#39;s some of my HDR related work:<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=HyLA3lhRdwM<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=15c1SKWD0cg<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=aSiGh7M_qac<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=garCIG_OmV4<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=M9pOjxdt99A<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=j2YdKNQHidM<br/> github .com/Filoppi/PumboAutoHDR<br/> github .com/Filoppi/Luma-Framework/<br/> bsky .app/profile/filoppi.bsky.social/post/3lnfx75ls2s2f<br/> bsky .app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lzktxjoa2k26<br/> dolphin-emu .org/blog/2024/04/30/dolphin-progress-report-addendum-hdr-block/<br/> youtube .com/watch?v=ANAYINl_6bg</p> <p>Proof to back the claims.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I first released a playtest of my game, there were several features missing, which is mostly expected. What I didn&#39;t expect is the one thing that would be brought up the most by players was that the game had no audio, I had to add a notice to the main menu saying the game had no audio so people would stop complaining. It&#39;s not that they were wrong about complaining, I just didn&#39;t expect it to be such a major problem.</p> <p>Later on, when the demo was released, sound effects and music were already added to the game. No one mentioned sounds at all, and I was very happy about it, since it meant that the audio I added to the game was fitting and of the expected quality.</p> <p>Of course, it&#39;s good to get people praising some aspect of your game, though in my case I&#39;m not trying to make sound a focus of the game so I don&#39;t need people to praise it, but it&#39;s still an important part of a game. I was also a bit surprised because an aspect of my game that I wasn&#39;t sure about was the one that got the most immediate and repeated praise (a dynamic multi-class system).</p> <p>I&#39;m saying all this because I often see people asking how to deal with negative feedback in here, and while it&#39;s obvious that having more feedback is better than no feedback, it&#39;s also good to pay attention to which things aren&#39;t mentioned at all, you can still learn things about your game from that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyablue"> /u/Cyablue </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nw2m8r/its_good_when_your_players_dont_say_anything/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nw2m8r/its_good_when_your_players_dont_say_anything/">[comments]</a></span></div>

In fact, I would say that the majority of the code on GitHub I found was using earlier versions.</p> <p>There are enough breaking changes between those earlier versions and the current versions that I would strongly suggest to anyone looking to use these crates to just bite the bullet and use the latest versions, even at the expense of having less readily-available reference code.</p> <p>There are a whole bunch of API calls in Apple frameworks which can only be made on the main thread (seems like a lot of NSWhatever structs are like this) - it took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out that the objc2 crate workspace also contains the <a href="https://docs.rs/dispatch2/0.3.0/dispatch2/"><code>dispatch2</code></a> crate to help with dispatching tasks to Grand Central Dispatch to run on the main thread either synchronously or asynchronously.</p> <p>While on the whole the experience felt quite &quot;Rustic&quot;, there are some notable exceptions where I had to use macros like <a href="https://docs.rs/objc2/latest/objc2/macro.define_class.html"><code>define_class!</code></a> to deal with Apple frameworks which rely on &quot;delegates&quot; and <a href="https://docs.rs/objc2/latest/objc2/macro.msg_send.html"><code>msg_send!</code></a>, the latter of which fills me with absolute dread.</p> <p>Once I was able to implement the equivalents of platform-specific functionality in komorebi for Windows, I was able to re-use the vast majority of the code in the Windows codebase.</p> <p>I&#39;m still quite amazed at <em>how little</em> work this required and the insanely high level of confidence I had in lifting and shifting huge features from the Windows implementation. I have been working in Rust for about 5 years now, and I didn&#39;t expect to be this surprised/amazed after so long in the ecosystem. I still can&#39;t quite believe what I have been able to accomplish in such a short period of time thanks to the fearlessness that Rust allows me to work with.</p> <p>As a bonus, I was also able to get the status bar, written in egui, working on macOS in less than 2 hours.</p> <p>In my experience, thanks to the maturity of both the <code>windows-rs</code> and <code>objc2</code> crates, Rust in 2025 is a solid choice for anyone interested in building cross-platform software which interacts heavily with system frameworks targeting both Windows and macOS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/toxait"> /u/toxait </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nwa2jg/update_and_experience_report_building_a_tiling/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nwa2jg/update_and_experience_report_building_a_tiling/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m excited to announce the release of <code>paft</code> v0.3.0! For those unfamiliar, <code>paft</code> is a library for provider-agnostic financial types in Rust. This release is a major refactor focused on modularity and usability.</p> <h3>‚ú® Highlight: <code>paft-money</code> - A Standalone Money Crate</h3> <p>The biggest addition is the new <code>paft-money</code> crate. It provides a robust <code>Money</code> and <code>Currency</code> type for your projects, backed by <code>iso_currency</code> and your choice of <code>rust_decimal</code> or <code>bigdecimal</code>.</p> <p>If you just need a reliable way to handle financial values without the rest of a large financial data library, you can now use **<code>paft-money</code> as a standalone dependency**. For those using the full ecosystem, it&#39;s also conveniently re-exported through the main <code>paft</code> facade.</p> <h3>Other Major Changes in 0.3.0</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Modular Crates</strong>: The core library has been split into smaller, focused crates (<code>paft-domain</code>, <code>paft-utils</code>, <code>paft-money</code>), so you can depend on just the parts you need for a smaller dependency graph.</li> <li><strong>Unified Error Handling</strong>: The <code>paft</code> facade now has a single <code>paft::Error</code> enum and <code>paft::Result&lt;T&gt;</code> alias, making error handling much simpler when using multiple components.</li> <li><strong>Stronger Identifiers</strong>: Instrument identifiers like <code>ISIN</code> and <code>FIGI</code> are now strongly-typed newtypes (<code>Isin</code>, <code>Figi</code>) with optional, feature-gated validation for improved type safety.</li> </ul> <p>This release includes several breaking changes related to the new structure, so please check the changelog for migration details.</p> <p>Feedback is always welcome!</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> * <strong>Crates.io</strong>: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/paft">https://crates.io/crates/paft</a> * <strong>Repository</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/paft-rs/paft">https://github.com/paft-rs/paft</a> * <strong>Changelog</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/paft-rs/paft/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">https://github.com/paft-rs/paft/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rare-Vegetable-3420"> /u/Rare-Vegetable-3420 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nw2zgt/announcing_paft_030_a_new_standalone_money_crate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nw2zgt/announcing_paft_030_a_new_standalone_money_crate/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Used Tauri to build Lokus, a note-taking app. Thought I&#39;d share my experience since Tauri 2.0 is still relatively new.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> Previously built desktop apps with Electron. Hated the bloat. Tried Tauri for this project.</p> <p><strong>The Good:</strong> - Bundle size: 10MB vs 100MB+ with Electron - Memory usage: ~50MB vs ~200MB - Startup time: sub-1 second consistently - Native feel on each platform - Rust backend = actual performance for heavy operations (search, graph layout) - Hot reload works great</p> <p><strong>The Challenging:</strong> - Debugging Rust&lt;-&gt;JS bridge can be painful - Smaller ecosystem than Electron - Some platform-specific quirks (especially Linux) - IPC serialization needs careful planning - Documentation is good but not as extensive as Electron</p> <p><strong>Performance wins:</strong> - Full-text search across 10k files: ~50ms (would be 500ms+ in pure JS) - Graph layout calculations in Web Worker + Rust: 60fps with 1000+ nodes - File operations are instant (no Node.js overhead)</p> <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> <code> React Frontend &lt;-&gt; Tauri IPC &lt;-&gt; Rust Backend ‚îú‚îÄ File System ‚îú‚îÄ Search Engine ‚îú‚îÄ Plugin Manager ‚îî‚îÄ MCP Server </code></p> <p><strong>Would I use Tauri again?</strong> Absolutely. The performance gains are worth the learning curve. Especially for apps that do heavy computation.</p> <p><strong>Caveats:</strong> - If your app is simple CRUD, Electron might be easier - If you need extensive native integrations, Tauri 2.0 shines - If bundle size matters, Tauri is a no-brainer</p> <p>Code is open source if you want to see a real-world example: <a href="https://github.com/lokus-ai/lokus">https://github.com/lokus-ai/lokus</a></p> <p>Happy to answer questions about the Rust/Tauri experience!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CodeWithInferno"> /u/CodeWithInferno </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nvvoee/built_a_desktop_app_with_tauri_20_impressions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nvvoee/built_a_desktop_app_with_tauri_20_impressions/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I just released version 0.0.3 of my library called QJS.</p> <p>QJS is a Go library that lets us run modern JavaScript directly inside Go, without CGO.</p> <p>The idea started when we needed a plugin system for Fastschema. For a while, we used goja, which is an excellent pure Go JavaScript engine. But as our use cases grew, we missed some modern JavaScript features, things like full async/await, ES2023 support, and tighter interoperability.</p> <p>That&#39;s when QJS was born. Instead of binding to a native C library, QJS embeds the QuickJS (NG fork) runtime inside Go using WebAssembly, running securely under Wazero. This means:</p> <ul> <li>No CGO headaches.</li> <li>A fully sandboxed, memory-safe runtime.</li> </ul> <p>Here&#39;s a quick benchmark comparison (computing factorial(10) one million times):</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Engine</th> <th align="left">Duration</th> <th align="left">Memory</th> <th align="left">Heap Alloc</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">Goja</td> <td align="left">1.054s</td> <td align="left">91.6 MB</td> <td align="left">1.5 MB</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">QJS</td> <td align="left"><strong>699.146ms</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>994.3 KB</strong></td> <td align="left">994.3 KB</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><em>Please refer to repository for full benchmark details.</em></p> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li>Full ES2023 compatibility (with modules, async/await, BigInt, etc.).</li> <li>Secure, sandboxed webassembly execution using Wazero.</li> <li>Go/JS Interoperability.</li> <li>Zero-copy sharing of Go values with JavaScript via ProxyValue.</li> <li>Expose Go functions to JS and JS functions back to Go.</li> </ul> <p>The project took inspiration from Wazero and the clever WASM-based design of ncruces/go-sqlite3. Both showed how powerful and clean WASM-backed solutions can be in Go.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve been looking for a way to run modern JavaScript inside Go without CGO, QJS might suit your needs.</p> <p>Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/fastschema/qjs">https://github.com/fastschema/qjs</a>.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any feature requests.

In Go we can‚Äôt do something like <code>&amp;‚Äùhello mom‚Äù</code> or <code>&amp;f()</code> because those are value that do not necessarily have space on the stack and might only be in the registers before being used. However we CAN do something like <code>&amp;app{name: ‚Äúthis is an app‚Äù}</code>. Why is that ? Is it because struct are special and as we know their size before usage the compilation will allocate space on the stack for them ? But isn‚Äôt it the case with strings then ? Raw string length is known at compilation time and we could totally have a reference for them, no ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NoahZhyte"> /u/NoahZhyte </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nvwu5l/go_reference/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nvwu5l/go_reference/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The idea: place vegetation (trees, bushes, grass, etc.) without handcrafting everything, but instead following realistic rules like ‚Äúwillows grow closer to water‚Äù.</p> <p>map_scatter provides different algorithms for generating candidate positions (e.g. Poisson disk, jitter grid). These positions are processed through a field graph, which holds rules for each ‚Äúkind‚Äù (like willow, beech, moss‚Ä¶). A position is either discarded or assigned a kind. This can happen in multiple layers ‚Äì first trees, then bushes, then smaller stuff like moss/grass.</p> <p>The output is a list of placements: each with a 2D position and the assigned kind. For 3D games (like Wild Spikes), you just add height. The field graph can also sample from textures, so you can plug in slope, moisture, or height maps to drive placement rules.</p> <p>Crate: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/map_scatter">https://crates.io/crates/map_scatter</a> Examples: <a href="https://github.com/morgenthum/map_scatter/blob/main/crates/map_scatter_examples/README.md">https://github.com/morgenthum/map_scatter/blob/main/crates/map_scatter_examples/README.md</a> Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/morgenthum.bsky.social">https://bsky.app/profile/morgenthum.bsky.social</a> (if you want to follow map_scatter of wild spikes progress)</p> <p>Ask me anything you want!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dcast0"> /u/dcast0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/x5rgovllupsf1.jpeg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1nw6r6b/map_scatter_released/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
