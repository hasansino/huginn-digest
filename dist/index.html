            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting a project that will require performing global data flow analysis for code generation. The motivation is, if you have</p> <pre><code>fn g(x: i32, y: i32) -&gt; i32 { h(x) + k(y) * 2 } fn f(a: i32, b: i32, c: i32) -&gt; i32 { g(a + b, b + c) } </code></pre> <p>I&#39;d like to generate a state machine that accepts a stream of values for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code> and recomputes only the values that will have changed. But unlike similar frameworks like <code>salsa</code>, I&#39;d like to generate a single type representing the entire DAG/state machine, at compile time. But, the example above demonstrates my current problem. I want the nodes in this state machine to be composable in the same way as functions, but a macro applied to <code>f</code> can&#39;t (as far as I know) &quot;look through&quot; the call to <code>g</code> and see that <code>k(y)</code> only needs to be recomputed when <code>b</code> or <code>c</code> changes. You can&#39;t generate optimal code without being able to see <em>every</em> expression that depends on an input.</p> <p>As far as I can tell, what I need to build is some sort of reflection macro that users can apply to both <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, that will generate code that users can call inside a proc macro that they declare, that they then call in a different crate to generate the graph. If you&#39;re throwing up in your mouth reading that, imagine how I felt writing it. However, all of the alternatives, such generating code that passes around bitsets to indicate which inputs are dirty, seem suboptimal.</p> <p>So, is there any way to do global data flow analysis from a macro directly? Or can you think of other ways of generating the state machine code directly from a proc macro?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CocktailPerson"> /u/CocktailPerson </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nmerig/talk_me_out_of_designing_a_monstrosity/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nmerig/talk_me_out_of_designing_a_monstrosity/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Everything else has been written from scratch by us, and over the next few months we want to replace LMDB with our own SOTA storage engine :)</p> <p>Helix can be split into 4 main parts: the gateway, the vector engine, the graph engine, and the LMDB storage engine.</p> <p>The gateway handles processing requests and interfaces directly with the graph and vector engines to run pre-compiled queries when a request is sent. </p> <p>The vector engine currently uses HNSW (although we are replacing this with a new algorithm which will boost performance significantly) to index and search vectors. The standard HNSW algorithm is designed to be in-memory, but this requires a complete rebuild of the index whenever new data or continuous sync with on-disk data, which makes new data not immediately searchable. We built Helix to store vectors and the HNSW graph on disk instead, by using some of the optimisations I&#39;ll list below, we we&#39;re able to achieve near in-memory performance while having instant start-up time (as the vector index is stored and doesn&#39;t need to be rebuilt on startup) and immediate search for new vectors.</p> <p>The graph engine uses a lazily-evaluating approach meaning only the data that is needed actually gets read. This means the maximum performance and the most minimal overhead. </p> <h1>Why we&#39;re faster?</h1> <p>First of all, our query language is type-safe and compiled. This means that the queries are built into the database instead of needing to be sent over a network, so we instantly save 500Œºs-1ms from not needing to parse the query.</p> <p>For a given node, the keys of its outgoing and incoming edges (with the same label) will have identical keys, instead of duplicating keys, we store the values in a subtree under the key. This saves not only a lot of storage space storing one key instead of all the duplicates, but also a lot of time. Given that all the values in the subtree have the same parent, LMDB can access all of the values sequentially from a single point in memory; essentially iterating through an array of values, instead of having to do random lookups across different parts of the tree. As the values are also stored in the same page (or sequential pages if the sub tree begins to exceed 4kb), LMDB doesn‚Äôt have to load multiple random pages into the OS cache, which can be slower.</p> <p>Helix uses these LMDB optimizations alongside a lazily-evalutating iterator based approach for graph traversal and vector operations which decodes data from LMDB at the latest possible point. We are yet to implement parallel LMDB access into Helix which will make things even faster.</p> <p>For the HNSW graph used by the vector engine, we store the connections between vectors like we do a normal graph. This means we can utilize the same performance optimizations from the graph storage for our vector storage. We also read the vectors as bytes from LMDB in chunks of 4 directly into 32 bit floats which reduces the number of decode iterations by a factor of 4. We also utilise SIMD instructions for our cosine similarity search calculations.</p> <p>Why we take up more space:<br/> As per the benchmarks, we take up 30% more space on disk than Neo4j. 75% of Helix‚Äôs storage size belongs to the outgoing and incoming edges. While we are working on enhancements to get this down, we see it as a very necessary trade off because of the read performance benefits we can get from having direct access to the directional edges instantly.</p> <h1>Benchmarks</h1> <p><strong>Vector Benchmarks</strong></p> <p>To benchmark our vector engine, we used the dbpedia-openai-1M dataset. This is the same dataset used by most other vector databases for benchmarking. We benchmarked against Qdrant using this dataset, focusing query latency. We only benchmarked the read performance because Qdrant has a different method of insertion compared to Helix. Qdrant focuses on batch insertions whereas we focus on incremental building of indexes. This allows new vectors to be inserted and queried instantly, whereas most other vectorDBs require the HNSW graph to be rebuilt every time new data is added. This being said in April 2025 Qdrant added incremental indexing to their database. This feature introduction has no impact on our read benchmarks. Our write performance is ~3ms per vector for the dbpedia-openai-1M dataset.</p> <p>The biggest contributing factor to the result of these benchmarks are the HNSW configurations. We chose the same configuration settings for both Helix and Qdrant:</p> <p>- m: 16, m_0: 32, ef_construction: 128, ef: 768, vector_dimension: 1536</p> <p>With these configuration settings, we got the following read performance benchmarks:<br/> HelixDB / accuracy: 99.5% / mean latency: 6ms<br/> Qdrant / accuracy: 99.6% / mean latency: 3ms</p> <p>Note that this is with both databases running on a single thread.</p> <p><strong>Graph Benchmarks</strong></p> <p>To benchmark our graph engine, we used the friendster social network dataset. We ran this benchmark against Neo4j, focusing on single hop performance.</p> <p>Using the friendster social network dataset, for a single hop traversal we got the following benchmarks:<br/> HelixDB / storage: 97GB / mean latency: 0.067ms<br/> Neo4j / storage: 62GB / mean latency: 37.81ms</p> <h1>Thanks for reading!</h1> <p>Thanks for taking the time to read through it. Again, we&#39;re working on a proper benchmarking suite which will be put together much better than what we have here, and with our new storage engine in the works we should be able to show some interesting comparisons between our current performance and what we have when we&#39;re finished.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested in following our development be sure to give us a star on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/helixdb/helix-db">https://github.com/helixdb/helix-db</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MoneroXGC"> /u/MoneroXGC </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nm99m4/built_a_database_in_rust_and_got_1000x_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nm99m4/built_a_database_in_rust_and_got_1000x_the/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The main reason is because I want to start using Go in earnest, and although I understand it doesn&#39;t require Git, it&#39;s beginning to seem like not using Git for it is putting me in a world of second-class documentation and more difficult workflows. So, I came up with a plan, and am in the process of implementing it. Unfortunately, I just ran into something that I didn&#39;t expect, and have questions. First, though, a little preliminary info:</p> <p>I have no interest in using GitHub or the like. The vast majority of my code is for my own personal use. I may wind up using GitHub or some such thing for the hypothetical rare exception, but that&#39;s a decision for later. Instead, I just self-host stuff.</p> <p>I understand that GitHub/whatever support &quot;private&quot; repositories, but I see absolutely no reason to upload my private stuff to the cloud, with the possible exception of backups. I have the whole backup thing well under control, so please don&#39;t suggest that as a reason for using GitHub/whatever.</p> <p>With that said, here&#39;s my plan (assume my local network is &quot;foo.bar&quot;):</p> <p>(1) Install a Forgejo server (i.e. a GitHub-like thing) as <a href="https://git.foo.bar">https://git.foo.bar</a> on my local network.</p> <p>(2) Install an Athens server (i.e. a Go proxy server) as <a href="https://goproxy.foo.bar">https://goproxy.foo.bar</a> on my local network. Have it fetch &quot;foo.bar/*&quot; directly from source control at <a href="https://git.foo.bar">https://git.foo.bar</a>, and have it fetch everything else from <a href="https://proxy.golang.org">https://proxy.golang.org</a>.</p> <p>(3) Set up the Athens server with its &quot;NoSumPatterns&quot; setting (i.e. a list of things that Athens will respond 403 to if asked for their sums, thus making clients need to put them in their GONOSUMDB settings) to &quot;foo.bar/*&quot;.</p> <p>(4) Set up my Go environment with:</p> <ul> <li>GOPROXY=&quot;<a href="https://goproxy.foo.bar,direct">https://goproxy.foo.bar,direct</a>&quot;</li> <li>GOPRIVATE=&quot;foo.bar/*&quot;</li> <li>GONOPROXY=&quot;&quot;</li> <li>GONOSUMDB=&quot;foo.bar/*&quot;</li> </ul> <p>(5) Make the pathnames of all my personal modules of the form &quot;foo.bar/*&quot;.</p> <p>My intentions, regarding numbers 4 and 5, were:</p> <p>(A) The client goes through Athens for everything.</p> <p>(B) Athens enforces the whole &quot;no sum&quot; thing for my personal packages.</p> <p>(C) My personal packages are considered by the standard Go tooling as &quot;private&quot;, so the tooling won&#39;t tell the outside world whatever the tooling otherwise tells the outside world. Given that this stuff on my network should not be accessible by the outside world, I gather that&#39;s limited to &quot;these specific package names might exist&quot;, but all in all I&#39;d prefer that the tooling not even tell the outside world that.</p> <p>I have done numbers 1, 2, and 3. But while doing #4, I ran into something unexpected: GONOPROXY is &quot;foo.bar/*&quot;.</p> <p>I understand that the default for GONOPROXY is the value of GOPRIVATE, so I guess that explains it. But I was surprised that the default was used when I <em>explicitly</em> set GONOPROXY to &quot;&quot;. Just in case, I double checked to make sure that my configuration sets that <em>after</em> setting GOPRIVATE, and it does.</p> <p>So I feel like I&#39;m misunderstanding something about all of this, but I&#39;m not sure exactly what it is that I&#39;m misunderstanding.</p> <p>Does the fact that I have my private modules&#39; pathnames in GONOPROXY <em>not</em> imply that the client will not try to get it from Athens?</p> <p>Is the resolution of the &quot;tool leakage&quot; stuff (which I&#39;m pretty sure I learned about via the standard Go documentation) <em>not</em> to put your private package pathnames in GOPRIVATE?</p> <p>Is there no way to set the client up to use the Athens proxy for private modules?</p> <p>Instead of my plan, should I set up the clients to get everything except foo.bar/* from Athens, and foo.bar/* from <a href="https://git.foo.bar">https://git.foo.bar</a>? I don&#39;t know exactly how to do that, but I presume it&#39;s possible.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p> <p><strong>EDIT, WITH APPARENT RESOLUTION</strong></p> <p>OK, for the benefit of anyone else who may find themselves in this situation in the future, I think I&#39;ve figured it out based on the <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#private-module-proxy-all">&quot;Private proxy serving all modules&quot; section of the &quot;Go Module Reference&quot; page</a>, which says in part:</p> <blockquote> <p>A central private proxy server that serves all modules (public and private) provides the most control for administrators and requires the least configuration for individual developers.</p> <p>To configure the go command to use such a server, set the following environment variables, replacing <a href="https://proxy.corp.example.com">https://proxy.corp.example.com</a> with your proxy URL and corp.example.com with your module prefix:</p> <p>GOPROXY=<a href="https://proxy.corp.example.com">https://proxy.corp.example.com</a> GONOSUMDB=corp.example.com</p> <p>The GOPROXY setting instructs the go command to only download modules from <a href="https://proxy.corp.example.com">https://proxy.corp.example.com</a>; the go command will not connect to other proxies or version control repositories.</p> <p>The GONOSUMDB setting instructs the go command not to use the public checksum database to authenticate modules with paths starting with corp.example.com.</p> </blockquote> <p>So it seems like the idea I suggested in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nmbdz6/goprivate_gonoproxy_gonosumdb_and_personal/nfbrmub/">my earlier comment</a> is correct:</p> <ul> <li>GOPROXY = &quot;<a href="https://goproxy.foo.bar,direct">https://goproxy.foo.bar,direct</a>&quot;</li> <li>GOPRIVATE=&quot;&quot;</li> <li>GONOPROXY = &quot;&quot;</li> <li>GONOSUMDB = &quot;foo.bar/*&quot;</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rwv37"> /u/rwv37 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nmbdz6/goprivate_gonoproxy_gonosumdb_and_personal/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nmbdz6/goprivate_gonoproxy_gonosumdb_and_personal/">[comments]</a></span></div>

To use it, you import the driver, but only for it&#39;s side-effects:</p> <p><code>go _ &quot;github.com/lib/pq&quot; // Driver registers itself </code></p> <p>Internally, the driver has code that calls the <code>sql.Register</code> function to register itself, so that you can later call <code>sql.Open</code> to get an instance of a database to call queries with. This seems odd to me, or at least, it&#39;s unusual. We don&#39;t usually have <code>init</code> functions, which do magic behind the scenes work.</p> <p>Why is the package structured this way?
