            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/mlange-42/ark">Ark</a> is an archetype-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">Entity Component System</a> (ECS) for <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>.</p> <h2>Release highlights</h2> <p>This is probably the biggest release since v0.1.0.</p> <h3>Event system</h3> <p>The highlight of this release is Ark&#39;s new comprehensive <a href="https://mlange-42.github.io/ark/events/">event system</a> built around lightweight, composable observers. Observers allow applications to react to ECS lifecycle changes, such as entity creation, component addition or removal, and relation updates. Observers can defines filters to match relevant events as well as entities. They follow the same declarative patterns as Ark‚Äôs query system.</p> <p>Beyond built-in lifecycle events like <code>OnCreateEntity</code> and <code>OnAddComponents</code>, the system supports custom event types. Custom events can be emitted manually and observed using the same filtering and callback mechanisms, making them ideal for modeling domain-specific interactions such as input handling, and other reactive game logic.</p> <h3>Concurrency-safe queries</h3> <p>As a new performance-related feature, filters and queries are now concurrency-safe and can be executed in parallel. There is a <a href="https://mlange-42.github.io/ark/queries/#parallel-queries">new section</a> on this in the user guide, as well as a new stand-alone <a href="https://github.com/mlange-42/ark/blob/main/examples/parallel_queries/main.go">example</a>.</p> <h3>Performance improvements</h3> <p>This release also includes a load of small performance improvements. Among other, archetype switching is now ~20% faster thanks to mask inlining. Query creation, table memory allocation, and bit-mask operations have been optimized. The new <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mlange-42/ark@v0.5.2/ecs#World.Shrink"><code>World.Shrink</code></a> method allows developers to reclaim memory that exceeds current usage, which is particularly useful in long-running or dynamic environments.</p> <h3>Documentation</h3> <p>Documentation has been expanded with a new chapter on the <a href="https://mlange-42.github.io/ark/events/">event system</a>, stand-alone examples for both built-in and custom events, and a dedicated example showing how to integrate Ark with the Ebiten game engine. A <a href="https://mlange-42.github.io/ark/cheatsheet/">cheat sheet</a> for common operations has been added and the API references have been improved in several areas.</p> <h3>Other</h3> <p>Additional improvements include better error messages, JSON (de)serialization for world stats, and enhanced IDE autocomplete via refined callback signatures. And finally, Ark has reached 100% test coverage.</p> <p>Full changelog: <a href="https://github.com/mlange-42/ark/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">https://github.com/mlange-42/ark/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md</a></p> <p>Feedback and contributions are always welcome. If you&#39;re using Ark in your game, simulation or engine, we&#39;d love to hear about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mlange-42"> /u/mlange-42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o68i8k/ark_v060_released_go_entity_component_system_ecs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o68i8k/ark_v060_released_go_entity_component_system_ecs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,<br/> I wanted to share a bit of reflection now after my the release of my first commercial game.</p> <p>Finishing a game is hard.<br/> Like‚Ä¶ <em>really</em> hard. The last 10% easily took longer than the first 90%. It‚Äôs where every bug, every small tweak, weird crashes that never occurred before, and every bit of self-doubt tries to stop you. But getting through that final stretch I can say taught me more than the entire journey before it.</p> <p>Not everyone will understand or even like your vision ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. Some of the feedback is at times soul crushing but you make games because <em>you</em> believe in them. If you don‚Äôt believe in it, no one else will.</p> <p>My first commercial game, <em>Checkout Blitz: The Shopping Dead</em>, released in August 19th 2025. Here‚Äôs where it stands so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Steam:</strong> 28 units sold, 5 returns</li> <li><strong>Xbox:</strong> 11 units</li> <li><strong>Atari VCS:</strong> I don‚Äôt have official reporting yet, but based on leader board entries, about 29 units.</li> </ul> <p>So, about ~60‚Äì70 copies total across platforms. At the time of release I had 1610 wishlist&#39;s on Steam.</p> <p>I knew going in that it wasn‚Äôt going to be a commercial hit. But that wasn‚Äôt really the goal ‚Äî finishing was. Releasing something real, from concept to release, as a solo developer was the real milestone.</p> <p>I went through publisher rejections. That stung. But the truth is, you don‚Äôt <em>need</em> a publisher to get something out there. The tools are there. The learning is there. And that moment of pressing ‚ÄúRelease‚Äù is absolutely real.</p> <p>What I learned:</p> <ul> <li>Most first games don‚Äôt sell much ‚Äî but they teach you everything.</li> <li>The final polish phase takes way longer than you expect.</li> <li>You‚Äôll question everything near the end. Keep going.</li> <li>People you meet along the way (at conventions, online, in dev chats) make it all worth it.</li> <li>Marketing is bigger than social media posts and I should have started way way sooner.</li> <li>Don&#39;t do Next Fest until you are actually ready for it. </li> <li>My game was better received when I was in front of people to explain it then when people played it organically on their own. (I did a few conventions where the feedback was awesome but didn&#39;t translate to actually dollars made). </li> <li>Community building is a skill on its own</li> </ul> <p>I ended up making a physical card game (reusing a lot of my art assets) based in the same universe and having copies made through &quot;thegamecrafter&quot;. Its weird to say that game has performed better so far revenue wise and I did like designing/play testing a physical card game with friends.</p> <p>For everyone who played, left a review, or stopped by my booth (at various conventions) to say they enjoyed it, thank you. </p> <p>For every developer who said I inspired them in some way, that means the world.</p> <p>Now, I get to take everything I learned and make the next one better.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs to every indie dev finishing their first game ‚Äî or anyone out there creating something on their own, no matter the outcome. </p> <p>You did it. That‚Äôs enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vectr2kev"> /u/vectr2kev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o6te26/how_my_first_indie_game_sold_and_what_i_learned/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o6te26/how_my_first_indie_game_sold_and_what_i_learned/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I recently did a deep dive into the automatic regional pricing that Steam suggests and compared that to the hourly wages of these countries. Spoiler alert, it&#39;s not good...</p> <p>MY METHODOLOGY: I gathered the minimum hourly wage of each country listed in Steam&#39;s regional pricing feature and multiplied it by x1.5 to determine what I believe to be a fair price for my game.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs what each column in my dataset represents:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Column A:</strong> Country/currency</li> <li><strong>Column B:</strong> Minimum hourly wage (local currency)</li> <li><strong>Column C:</strong> Steam‚Äôs automatically suggested price for my $9.99 USD game (local currency)</li> <li><strong>Column D:</strong> My adjusted price (1.5√ó the local hourly wage)</li> <li><strong>Column E:</strong> The percentage difference between Steam‚Äôs suggestion and my adjusted price (how far off Steam‚Äôs pricing is from a fair local rate)</li> <li><strong>Column F:</strong> The USD conversion of my adjusted price</li> </ul> <p>Each row lists values in <strong>that country‚Äôs currency</strong>, not USD, since that‚Äôs how it appears on Steam.</p> <p>SOME ASTERISKS:</p> <p>- It was very hard to find the minimum hourly wage for some of these countries, so if you are local to a certain country and notice that I am way off, please feel free to reach out and I will promptly adjust it here and on Steam</p> <p>- I have not yet published the updated prices on Steam because I wanted to post here to see if there were places that I need to lower the price more in order for a fair price to be achieved</p> <p>- The additional regions section is a mess! For those, I averaged wages across countries in that region and applied the same 1.5√ó multiplier. If you have a better suggestion for achieving fair pricing, I‚Äôd love to hear it.</p> <p>- To access this tool in order to adjust your own game&#39;s prices, sign into your steamworks account, and under apps and packages, click on the pricing option (make sure to filter to all games if you haven&#39;t released your game yet).</p> <p>- I did not increase prices if my formula came up with a

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Introduction: The Problem with the Datastore Emulator</h1> <p>Anyone who works with Google Datastore in local environments has probably faced this situation: the emulator starts light, but over time it turns into a <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/python-datastore/issues/582#event-15802729926">memory‚Äëhungry</a> monster. And worst of all, it loves to corrupt your data files when you least expect it.</p> <p>In our team, Datastore is a critical part of the stack. Although it‚Äôs a powerful NoSQL database, the local emulator simply couldn‚Äôt keep up. With large dumps, performance would drop drastically, and the risk of data corruption increased. Each new development day became the same routine: clean up, restore, and hope it wouldn‚Äôt break again.</p> <h1>Attempts at a Solution</h1> <p>At first, we tried reducing the backup size, which worked for a while, but the problem soon reappeared. Another alternative would be to use a real database for each developer, or, as a last resort, build our own emulator. It sounded like a challenging idea at first, but also a fascinating one.</p> <h1>Reverse Engineering: Understanding the APIs and Protobufs</h1> <p>Once I decided to build an alternative emulator, I started with the most important step: understanding how Datastore communicates.</p> <p>Fortunately, Google provides the <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/c98457cd51f80e56daf7de102ed8d4c347ada663/google/datastore/v1/entity.proto">protobufs</a> used by the Datastore API. This includes all the messages, services, and methods exposed by the standard gRPC API, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Lookup</li> <li>RunQuery</li> <li>BeginTransaction</li> <li>Commit</li> <li>Rollback</li> <li>AllocateIds</li> </ul> <p>With these interfaces in hand, I started implementing my own emulator. The idea was to create a gRPC server that mimics Datastore‚Äôs behavior. I began with basic operations like Lookup, all hardcoded, and gradually implemented others, also hardcoded, just to understand the flow. Eventually, I had all the methods stubbed out, each returning static data. That‚Äôs when I decided it was time to figure out how to actually store data.</p> <h1>Key Design Decisions</h1> <p><strong>In‚ÄëMemory First:</strong><br/> The priority was performance and simplicity. By keeping everything in RAM, I avoided disk locks and heavy I/O operations. That alone eliminated most of the corruption and leak issues.</p> <p><strong>Save on Shutdown:</strong><br/> When the emulator is stopped, it automatically persists the data into a <code>datastore.bin</code> file. This ensures the local state isn‚Äôt lost between sessions. There‚Äôs some risk of data loss if the process is killed abruptly, but it‚Äôs an acceptable trade‚Äëoff since this emulator is meant for local development only.</p> <h1>Ensuring Compatibility</h1> <p>To ensure my emulator behaved faithfully to the original, I ran side‚Äëby‚Äëside tests: I spun up both the standard emulator and my own, created two clients,one for each, and ran the exact same sequence of operations, comparing results afterward.<br/> Each test checked a specific feature such as insertion, filtered queries, or transactions. Obviously, it‚Äôs impossible to cover 100% of use cases, but I focused on what was essential for my workflow. This helped uncover several bugs and inconsistencies.</p> <p>For instance, I noticed that when a query returns more items than the limit, the emulator automatically performs pagination and the client aggregates all pages together.</p> <p>As testing progressed, I found that the official emulator had several limitations ‚Äî some operations were <em>not supported by design</em>, such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator#known_issues">&quot;IN&quot;, &quot;!=&quot;, and &quot;NOT‚ÄëIN&quot;</a>. At that point, I decided to also use a <a href="https://github.com/guibeira/datastore-emulator/tree/main/tests">real Datastore instance</a> for more complex tests, which turned out to be essential for ensuring full compatibility given the emulator‚Äôs restrictions.</p> <h1>Importing and Exporting Dumps</h1> <p>Another key feature was the ability to import Datastore dumps. This is absolutely essential for my local development setup, since I can‚Äôt start from scratch every time.</p> <p>Luckily, the dump format is quite simple, essentially a file containing multiple entities serialized in protobuf. Even better, someone had already reverse‚Äëengineered the format, which you can check out in <a href="https://github.com/remko/dsbackups">dsbackups</a>. That project helped me a lot in understanding the structure.</p> <p>With that knowledge, I implemented the import feature and skipped export support for now, since it‚Äôs not something I need at the moment.</p> <p>The import runs in the background, and after a few optimizations, it now takes around 5 seconds to import a dump with 150k entities ‚Äî a huge improvement compared to the 10 minutes of the official emulator.</p> <h1>Ok, It Works ‚Äî But How Fast Is It?</h1> <p>Once the emulator was functional, I asked myself: how fast is it compared to the original?<br/> The main goal was to fix the memory and corruption issues, but if it turned out faster, that‚Äôd be a bonus.</p> <p>Given that the official emulator is written in Java and mine in Rust, I expected a noticeable difference. To measure it, I wrote a script that performs a series of operations (insert, query, update, delete) on both emulators and records the total execution time.</p> <p>The results were impressive, my emulator was consistently faster across every operation. In some cases, like single inserts, it was up to <strong>50√ó faster</strong>.</p> <pre><code>python benchmark/test_benchmark.py --num-clients 30 --num-runs 5 --- Benchmark Summary --- Operation: Single Insert - Rust (30 clients, 5 runs each): - Total time: 0.8413 seconds - Avg time per client: 0.0280 seconds - Java (30 clients, 5 runs each): - Total time: 48.1050 seconds - Avg time per client: 1.6035 seconds - Verdict: Rust was 57.18x faster overall.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start off with the downside: this would start to fragment Rust into &quot;dialects&quot;, where code from one project can&#39;t be directly copied into another and it&#39;s harder for new contributors to a project to read and write. It would increase the amount of non-local context that you need to keep in mind whenever you&#39;re reading an unfamiliar bit of code.</p> <p>The basic idea between the <code>Copy</code> and <code>Clone</code> trait distinction is that <code>Copy</code> types can be cheaply and trivially copied while <code>Clone</code> types may be expensive or do something unexpected when copied, so when they are copied it should be explicitly marked with a call to <code>clone()</code>. The trivial/something unexpected split still seems important, but the cheap/expensive distinction isn&#39;t perfect. Copying a <code>[u8; 1000000]</code> is definitely more expensive than cloning a <code>Rc&lt;[u8; 1000000]&gt;</code>, yet the first one happens automatically while the second requires an explicit function call. It&#39;s also a one-size-fits-all threshold, even though some projects can&#39;t tolerate an unexpected 100-byte memcopy while others use <code>Arc</code> without a care in the world.</p> <p>What if each project or module could control which kinds of copies happen explicitly vs. implicitly instead of making it part of the type definition? I thought of two attributes that could be helpful in certain domains to define which copies are expensive enough that they need to be explicitly marked and which are cheap enough that being explicit is just useless noise that makes the code harder to read:</p> <p><code>[implicit_copy_max_size(N)]</code> - does not allow any type with a size above N bytes to be used as if it was <code>Copy</code>. Those types must be cloned instead. I&#39;m not sure how moves should interact with this, since those can be exactly as expensive as copies but are often compiled into register renames or no-ops.</p> <p><code>[implicit_clone(T,U)]</code> - allows the types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> to be used as if they were <code>Copy</code>. The compiler inserts <code>clone</code> calls wherever necessary, but still moves the value instead of cloning it if it isn&#39;t used afterwards. Likely to be used on <code>Arc</code> and <code>Rc</code>, but even <code>String</code> could be applicable depending on the program&#39;s performance requirements.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/minno"> /u/minno </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o6rl7q/another_solution_to_handle_ergonomics_explicit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o6rl7q/another_solution_to_handle_ergonomics_explicit/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>Since my last post, I‚Äôve made quite a few changes to RTIPC, a small library for real-time inter-process communication using shared memory. It‚Äôs still unstable, but progressing.</p> <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/mausys/rtipc-rust">rtipc-rust</a></p> <h1>What is RTIPC?</h1> <p>RTIPC creates zero-copy, wait-free, single-producer/single-consumer circular message queues in shared memory. It‚Äôs designed for real-time Linux applications where processes need to communicate efficiently.</p> <h1>Major Changes Since Last Post</h1> <ul> <li>New Connection Model: Previously, a single shared memory file descriptor was used, which contained all the message queues along with their metadata. Now, the client connects to the server via a UNIX domain socket and sends: <ul> <li>A request message with header + channel infos.</li> <li>A control message that includes the shared memory FD and optional eventfds (via <em>SCM_RIGHTS</em>).</li> </ul></li> <li>User Metadata in Requests: The request message can now include custom user data. This can be used to verify the message structure.</li> <li>Optional <em>eventfd</em> Support: Channels can now optionally use <em>eventfd</em> in semaphore mode, making them compatible with <em>select</em>/<em>poll</em>/<em>epoll</em> loops. Useful if you want to integrate RTIPC into event-driven application.</li> <li>Better Examples: The examples are now split into a server and client, which can talk to each other ‚Äî or to the examples in the RTIPC C library. (<a href="https://github.com/mausys/rtipc">rtipc</a>)</li> </ul> <h1>What‚Äôs Next</h1> <ul> <li>improve communication protocol: Right now, the server accepts all incoming requests. In the future, the server can send back a Ok/deny to the client.</li> <li>Logging: Add proper logging for debugging and observability.</li> <li>Documentation &amp; Testing: Improve both. Right now, it&#39;s minimal.</li> <li>Schema Language &amp; Codegen: I plan to define an interface definition language (IDL) and create tools to auto-generate bindings for other languages.</li> </ul> <h1>What‚Äôs the Purpose?</h1> <p>RTIPC is admittedly a niche library. The main goal is to help refactor large monolithic real-time applications (usually written in C/C++) on Linux.</p> <p>Instead of rewriting the entire application, you can isolate parts of your application and connect them via RTIPC ‚Äî following the Unix philosophy:<br/> <em>‚ÄúDo One Thing and Do It Well.‚Äù</em></p> <p>So if you&#39;re working on linux based real-time systems and looking for lightweight IPC with real-time characteristics, this might be useful to you.</p> <p>Let me know what you think ‚Äî feedback, questions, or suggestions welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maurersystems"> /u/maurersystems </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o6n80n/update_rtipc_realtime_interprocess_communication/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o6n80n/update_rtipc_realtime_interprocess_communication/">[comments]</a></span></div>
