            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>&#39;s,</p> <p>A few Days ago, I posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kze9h3/i_think_go_needs_constructors_heres_why/">this thread</a> about how Go could benefit from proper constructors. The discussion that followed was honestly more insightful than I expected ‚Äî lots of thoughtful suggestions, counterpoints, and alternative patterns.</p> <p>I‚Äôve spent some time digesting all of it and experimenting with ways to apply those ideas. I ended up building something around server creation that reflects a lot of what we talked about. It&#39;s a small package I‚Äôve been using to spin up HTTP and HTTPS servers across a few languages ‚Äî Go, especially. Along the way, I tried to bring in the kind of constructor-like flexibility we were discussing.</p> <p>If you&#39;re curious how that turned out, the code&#39;s here: <a href="https://github.com/vrianta/Server">vrianta/Server</a>. It‚Äôs not trying to reinvent the wheel, but I think it captures some of the design patterns we cleanly debated last time.</p> <p>As a bonus, I also used it to serve a resume project: <a href="https://github.com/pritam-is-next/resume">pritam-is-next/resume</a>.</p> <p>Would love to hear what you all think of the direction it‚Äôs gone, especially if anything feels better (or worse) after seeing it in practice.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/trendsbay"> /u/trendsbay </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l0djfi/i_think_go_needs_constructors_update_after_all/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l0djfi/i_think_go_needs_constructors_update_after_all/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks üëã</p> <p>I‚Äôve been learning Go lately and wanted to build something real with it ‚Äî something that‚Äôd help me understand the language better, and maybe be useful too. I ended up with a project called Ghoti.</p> <p>Ghoti is a small centralized server that exposes 1000 configurable ‚Äúslots.‚Äù Each slot can act as a memory cell, a token bucket, a leaky bucket, a broadcast signal, an atomic counter, or a few other simple behaviors. It‚Äôs all driven by a really minimal plain-text protocol over TCP (or Telnet), so it‚Äôs easy to integrate with any language or system.</p> <p>The idea isn‚Äôt to replace full distributed systems tooling ‚Äî it&#39;s more about having a small, fast utility for problems that get overly complicated when distributed. For example:</p> <ul> <li>distributed locks (using timeout-based memory ownership)</li> <li>atomic counters</li> <li>distributed rate limiting</li> <li>leader election Sometimes having a central point actually makes things easier (if you&#39;re okay with the trade-offs). Ghoti doesn‚Äôt persist data, and doesn‚Äôt try to replicate state ‚Äî it‚Äôs more about coordination than storage. There‚Äôs also experimental clustering support (using RAFT for now), mostly for availability rather than consistency.</li> </ul> <p>Here‚Äôs the repo if you&#39;re curious: üîó <a href="https://github.com/dankomiocevic/ghoti">https://github.com/dankomiocevic/ghoti</a></p> <p>I‚Äôm still working on it ‚Äî there are bugs to fix, features to finish, and I‚Äôm sure parts of the design could be improved. But it‚Äôs been a great learning experience so far, and I figured I‚Äôd share in case it‚Äôs useful to anyone else or sparks any ideas.</p> <p>Would love feedback or suggestions if you have any ‚Äî especially if you&#39;ve solved similar problems in other ways.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/danko-ghoti"> /u/danko-ghoti </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l05qkz/ghoti_the_centralized_friend_for_your_distributed/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1l05qkz/ghoti_the_centralized_friend_for_your_distributed/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Lately,<br/> I&#39;ve been working on a couple of large CLIs and like I said, everything is great until I need to build<br/> a release via GitHub actions. I was using vanilla actions, but the release switched over to goreleaser, but<br/> the frustration continued...most with arch builds being wrong or some other obscure reason for not building. </p> <p>The fix normally results in me making new tags after adjustments to fix the build errors. I should mention that everything builds fine on my machine for all the build archs. </p> <p>So really I guess I am asking what everyone else‚Äôs workflow is?

I can work my way around most things in the language if I put my mind to it, so I don‚Äôt think mastery of basics is the issue.</p> <p>I have spent a LOT of time reading up on it outside of work (which is not rust related).</p> <p>‚Ä¶But I find myself endlessly demoralised by it. Every weekend I look forward to programming in it and at the end I end up disappointed. Every weekend. It‚Äôs my first systems language and I have been seriously trying to get better for about 8 months off and on when I get time. However I think I am failing; I feel overwhelmed by everything in the language and most of my questions are more conceptual and thus not precise enough to get straight answers a lot of the time.</p> <p>When I build things I am absolutely riddled with doubt. As I program sometimes I feel that my code is elegant at a line by line, function by function level but the overall structure of my code, I am constantly second guessing whether it is idiomatic, whether it is natural and clean‚Ä¶whether I am organizing it right. I try to make pragmatic elegant decisions but this tends to yield more complexity later due to things I do not possess the foresight to predict. My attempts to reduce boilerplate with macros I worry aren‚Äôt as intuitive as I hope. I get caught chasing wild geese to remedy the code I keep hating.</p> <p>Ultimately I end up abandoning all of my projects which is soul destroying because I don‚Äôt feel I am improving at design. They just feel overdesigned, somehow messy and not very good. </p> <p>Can I get some deeper advice on this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wandering_platypator"> /u/wandering_platypator </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l07xyc/second_guessing_and_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l07xyc/second_guessing_and_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I was working on a schema translation tool (i.e., TypeScript types to Rust types) and wanted a Trie library.

This crate tries to address this.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey rustacians!</p> <p>Following the announcment on Pipex! crate, I was pleased to see that many of you welcomed the core idea and appoach. Based on community feedback it became obvious that next major update should reconsider Error handling. </p> <p>After few iterations I decided that Extensible error handling strategies via proc macros is way to go.</p> <p>Let me show: ```rust use pipex::*;</p> <h1>[error_strategy(IgnoreHandler)]</h1> <p>async fn process_even(x: i32) -&gt; Result&lt;i32, String&gt; { if x % 2 == 0 {Ok(x * 2)} else {Err(&quot;Odd number&quot;.to_string())} }</p> <h1>[tokio::main]</h1> <p>async fn main() { // This will ignore errors from odd numbers let result1 = pipex!( vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5] =&gt; async |x| { process_even(x).await } ); ```</p> <p>Pipex provides several built-in error handling strategies, but the best part is that users can define their own error handling strategies by implementing <strong><em>ErrorHandler</em></strong> trait.</p> <p>```rust use pipex::*;</p> <p>pub struct ReverseSuccessHandler; impl&lt;T, E&gt; ErrorHandler&lt;T, E&gt; for ReverseSuccessHandler { fn handle_results(results: Vec&lt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Vec&lt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt; { let mut successes: Vec&lt;Result&lt;T, E&gt;&gt; = results .into_iter() .filter(|r| r.is_ok()) .collect(); successes.reverse(); successes } }</p> <p>register_strategies!( ReverseSuccessHandler for &lt;i32, String&gt; )</p> <h1>[error_strategy(ReverseSuccessHandler)]</h1> <p>async fn process_items_with_reverse(x: i32) -&gt; Result&lt;i32, String&gt; { ... } ```</p> <p>The resulting syntax looks clean and readable to avarage user, while being fully extendible and composable. </p> <p>Let me know what you think!</p> <p>P.S. Extendable error handling introduced some overhead by creating wrapper fn&#39;s and PipexResult type. Also, explicit typing (Ok::&lt;_, String) is needed in some cases for inline expressions. Since I hit the limit of my Rust knowledge, contributors are welcomed to try to find better implementations with less overhead, but same end-user syntax.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dransyy"> /u/dransyy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pipex">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l01k9k/presenting_pipex_0114_extensible_error_handling/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all ‚Äî quick update on <a href="https://github.com/beowolx/rensa">Rensa</a>, a MinHash library I‚Äôve been building in Rust with Python bindings. It‚Äôs focused on speed and works well for deduplicating large text datasets ‚Äî especially stuff like LLM fine-tuning where near duplicates are a problem.</p> <p>Originally, I built a custom algorithm called <strong>RMinHash</strong> because existing tools (like <code>datasketch</code>) were way too slow for my use cases. RMinHash is a fast, simple alternative to classic MinHash and gave me much better performance on big datasets.</p> <p>Since I last posted, I‚Äôve added:</p> <ul> <li><strong>CMinHash</strong> ‚Äì full implementation based on the paper (‚ÄúC-MinHash: reducing K permutations to two‚Äù). It‚Äôs highly optimized, uses batching + vectorization.</li> <li><strong>OptDensMinHash</strong> ‚Äì handles densification for sparse data, fills in missing values in a principled way.</li> </ul> <p>I ran benchmarks on a 100K-row dataset (<code>gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql</code>) with 256 permutations:</p> <ul> <li><code>CMinHash</code>: 5.47s</li> <li><code>RMinHash</code>: 5.58s</li> <li><code>OptDensMinHash</code>: 12.36s</li> <li><code>datasketch</code>: 92.45s</li> </ul> <p>So yeah, still ~10-17x faster than datasketch, depending on variant.</p> <p>Accuracy-wise, all Rensa variants produce very similar (sometimes identical) results to <code>datasketch</code> in terms of deduplicated examples.</p> <p>It‚Äôs a side project I built out of necessity and I&#39;d love to get some feedback from the community :)<br/> The Python API is simple and should feel familiar if you‚Äôve used datasketch before.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/rensa">https://github.com/beowolx/rensa</a></p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BeowulfBR"> /u/BeowulfBR </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/beowolx/rensa">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kzzvag/update_rensa_added_full_cminhash_optdensminhash/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everybody!</p> <p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simplersble">SimpleRsBLE</a>, the Rust bindings for <a href="https://simpleble.org?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=rust">SimpleBLE</a>, a cross-platform Bluetooth library specifically designed for use in all kinds of environments with a very simple API that just works, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their projects without much effort, instead of wasting hours and hours on development.</p> <p>We provide comprehensive functionality support for BLE Central mode, enabling developers to scan and discover nearby BLE devices, handle pairing and connection management of peripherals, and interact with GATT characteristics and descriptors just to name a few.</p> <p>Want to know more about SimpleBLE&#39;s capabilities or see what others are building with it? Ask away!</p> <p><strong>You haven‚Äôt made a new release in like forever, what has changed?</strong></p> <p>The main change I wanted to bring to attention was the new API for the Rust bindings that we just released. We ditched the original callback approach in favor of using event streams, and all objects are now Clone-friendly, making it easier to pass them around in async environments. You can see the new API in <a href="https://github.com/simpleble/simpleble/tree/main/examples/simplersble">our examples</a>. I‚Äôm not a Rust expert by any means, so any criticism and comments on how to improve the API design are welcome.</p> <p>Aside from the changes to the API, there have also been lots of improvements and feature additions to the internals which you can see on <a href="https://github.com/simpleble/simpleble/blob/main/docs/changelog.rst">our changelog</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why only bindings and not a full rewrite in Rust?</strong></p> <p>We love Rust as a language, but given the history of SimpleBLE and its core written in C++ that has been extensively battle tested across multiple industries and thousands of users, it would become a major undertaking without a clear return on the time invested to get to the same level of reliability. However, after this being said, the reason we went ahead with the bindings is that we intend to build some internal components and additional products using Rust, for which the first step is to have a set of usable bindings we can rely upon.</p> <p><strong>Why is the license not MIT/Apache?</strong></p> <p>Part of the reason I‚Äôm even here in the first place is the fact that SimpleBLE has gone the commercial route with a BUSL 1.1 license instead of becoming another piece of abandonware. In the past year we‚Äôve been able to invest more than 1000 hours in developer time, added backend support for Android, bindings for Java and Rust (with more on the works) as well as a few more ambitious features, support and tooling that are only possible in a commercial setting.</p> <p>This being said, SimpleBLE is free for non-commercial use and we offer significant discounts for small companies to make sure that cost is never an issue when trying to adopt us. If you‚Äôre interested in a pure-Rust alternative, we highly recommend you try btleplug.</p> <p><strong>One last thing.</strong> If you‚Äôre the creator of an open source project and are interested in going down the commercial route, you can learn more about our work at <a href="https://californiaopensource.com?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=simpleble_rust">The California Open Source Company website</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kevindewald"> /u/kevindewald </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kznws7/simpleble_crossplatform_bluetooth_library_that/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kznws7/simpleble_crossplatform_bluetooth_library_that/">[comments]</a></span></div>
