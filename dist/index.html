            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">/r/golang</a> </p> <p>Since the start of the year, I&#39;ve been spending my time learning DDD (Domain-Driven Design).</p> <p>I&#39;ve consumed a lot of Go, Java, and C# content, as most of the literature is written in these languages (thanks, Vaughn Vernon &amp; threedots.tech + more under &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;).</p> <p>After writing a few apps applying DDD in idiomatic Go, I got interested in event sourcing.</p> <p>Turns out, explanations of event sourcing were either waaay too vague for me OR very, very verbose (looking at you, Java and .NET frameworks). I wanted an idiomatic Go framework that would help me understand event sourcing better, see how it ties into DDD, and educate others about it - which I think is a very cool and powerful concept.</p> <p>Hopefully, I&#39;ve achieved some of that: <a href="https://github.com/DeluxeOwl/chronicle">https://github.com/DeluxeOwl/chronicle</a></p> <p>I worked on the docs to follow a &quot;code-and-explanation&quot; style, where we use each piece of the framework and explain the &quot;why&quot; behind it. </p> <p>I recommend taking 20 seconds to scroll through the quickstart to get a feel for how the docs are structured: <a href="https://github.com/DeluxeOwl/chronicle?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart">https://github.com/DeluxeOwl/chronicle?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart</a></p> <p>The README contains a lot of examples and covers things like:</p> <ul> <li> Modeling aggregates (your domain objects) as events</li> <li> Business rules and commands</li> <li> Optimistic concurrency control</li> <li> Eventual consistency</li> <li> The transactional outbox pattern &amp; reliable message publishing</li> <li> Snapshots</li> <li> Projections</li> <li> Global ordering</li> <li> The event log - an immutable, append-only store for events with different backends (Postgres, SQLite, etc.)</li> <li> Crypto-shredding for GDPR</li> </ul> <p>If you&#39;re looking for a quick code snippet, here you go:</p> <pre><code>type Account struct { aggregate.Base id AccountID openedAt time.Time balance int // we need to know how much money an account has holderName string } func (a *Account) Apply(evt AccountEvent) error { switch event := evt.(type) { case *accountOpened: a.id = event.ID a.openedAt = event.OpenedAt a.holderName = event.HolderName case *moneyWithdrawn: a.balance -= event.Amount case *moneyDeposited: a.balance += event.Amount default: return fmt.Errorf(&quot;unexpected event kind: %T&quot;, event) } return nil } func (a *Account) DepositMoney(amount int) error { if amount &lt;= 0 { return errors.New(&quot;amount must be greater than 0&quot;) } return a.recordThat(&amp;moneyDeposited{ Amount: amount, }) } </code></pre> <p>I&#39;d appreciate you taking a look and providing some honest feedback. </p> <p>There&#39;s still plenty to do (perfectionism sucks), but I feel the foundation is solid.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thrimbor"> /u/Thrimbor </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1n2h3q9/chronicle_idiomatic_type_safe_event_sourcing/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1n2h3q9/chronicle_idiomatic_type_safe_event_sourcing/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been writing Rust code for the last 4ish months and writing code in general for about a year. Recently I got a new job and had an idea for a project that I wanted to develop seriously (not as a practice throw-away project).</p> <p>Today I published my first crate, Sericom. At work I connect to used networking equipment via their console port to erase any data, clear configs, and more or less set them back to a factory default state to be resold. We use programs like Terra Term and Putty to facilitate the serial connection - this is where I got the idea to create my own CLI tool, using Rust, to use instead of Putty or Terra Term.</p> <p>I would really appreciate if anyone would be willing to take some time to review my code. You probably won&#39;t be able to actually use it&#39;s main functionality (unless you have a device lying around with a console port), but that&#39;s okay - I&#39;m really just looking to see if my code is actually structured well and I&#39;m not doing anything weird that I missed since I don&#39;t have much experience programming in general.</p> <p>I used the `tracing` crate and `tokio-console` throughout development to see how my tokio tasks are running and as you&#39;ll see in my code, I ended up using a lot of &quot;timers&quot; within tokio tasks that I spawn to keep them from being polled as time goes on but the serial connection session is idle (no new data/activity is happening, so tasks would be polled for no reason) - these timers look really messy and magic but I&#39;m wondering if this somewhat normal??</p> <p>The timers work and keep my tasks from being polled unnecessarily when there is nothing to process, but just seem messy to me. I develop on Linux so I would use `strace` to see syscalls being made when running my program and spent roughly a day playing around with different batching/buffering implementations to lower syscalls that were initially pretty high.</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty happy with the results I see when monitoring with things like `tokio-console` and `strace` now, and the overall performance of the tool - I now use it as my main tool at work instead of Putty or Terra Term. If you&#39;d like to get more information on the results I see from `strace` or `tokio-console` feel free to ask.</p> <p>I enjoy watching Jon Gjengset&#39;s videos and probably watched his &quot;Decrusting the tokio crate&quot; video 3-4 times while writing my code to help understand how tokio works and what I probably should or shouldn&#39;t be doing.</p> <p>Thank you in advance if you&#39;re able to review my code, I&#39;d greatly appreciate any advice, constructive critisism, or questions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Stinkygrass"> /u/Stinkygrass </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/tkatter/sericom">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2ubql/first_crate_would_really_appreciate_code_review/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>TLDR/What is it?:</strong></p> <p>I developed a crate that wraps the C library <code>libsais</code> by Ilya Grebnov into a mostly safe Rust API. <code>libsais</code> is a very fast library for suffix array construction, Burrows-Wheeler-Transform + reversal, and (permuted) longest common prefix arrays. These are all data structures used in sequence analysis and bioinformatics. Check it out for more information: <a href="https://github.com/feldroop/libsais-rs"><strong>libsais-rs</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Code sample:</strong></p> <pre><code>use libsais::{SuffixArrayConstruction, ThreadCount}; let text = b&quot;barnabasbabblesaboutbananas&quot;; let suffix_array: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = SuffixArrayConstruction::for_text(text) .in_owned_buffer() .multi_threaded(ThreadCount::openmp_default()) .run() .expect(&quot;The example in the README should really work&quot;) .into_vec(); </code></pre> <p><strong>Background:</strong></p> <p>After multiple attemps and downsizing 3-5 times, I actually managed to finish and polish a side project! Since this is my first such project, I&#39;d be thankful and interested in any kind of feedback and constructive criticism. I put a decent amount of effort into designing the API and <a href="https://docs.rs/libsais/latest/libsais/">documentation</a>. </p> <p>The main technical challenge was to transform the flat C API of libsais (<a href="https://docs.rs/libsais-sys/latest/libsais_sys/">raw bindings</a>) into a fully generic, builder-like Rust API. Maybe it would have been much simpler to create a less generic API that is closer to the original interface. </p> <p>The C API contains many functions that do the same thing for different input/output data types and with/without parallelism. I wanted to create a struct that is generic over usage of parallelism, input type and output type. I didn&#39;t find a simple way of translating the generics of that struct into the flat functions of the C interface, so I came up with <a href="https://github.com/feldroop/libsais-rs/blob/master/src/generics_dispatch/mod.rs#L15">this convoluted gadget</a> (which rustfmt apparently also doesn&#39;t like). </p> <pre><code>pub type SmallAlphabetFunctionsDispatch&lt;I, O, P&gt; = &lt;&lt;&lt;P as Parallelism&gt; ::WithInput&lt;I, O&gt; as InputDispatch&lt;I, O&gt; &gt; ::WithOutput as OutputDispatch&lt;I,O&gt; &gt; ::SmallAlphabetFunctions; </code></pre> <p>I believe I essentially created a something like a tree inside the type system. Does anyone know a simpler way of achieving my goal here?</p> <p>I felt like I was mainly missing a language feature that represents a closed set of types, like a sealed trait with language support (I found <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3323-restrictions.html">this related RFC </a>and <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/sealed-traits/16797/2">this discussion</a>). In addition to this, I would have needed a way of generalizing from individual trait impls to generic impls (kind of the opposite of specialization). Is this something that someone else here has encountered and thought about?</p> <p>Finally, I was wondering about whether all of this effort made sense in the first place. My new Rust API definitely has some benefits like safety and less repetition, but it also is quite noisy and not beginner-friendly due to lifetimes and typestate. After all, the C API is not as theoretically fancy, but it is simple and clean.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/frolix_bloop"> /u/frolix_bloop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2jkqt/announcing_libsais_bindings_flat_c_api_to_generic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2jkqt/announcing_libsais_bindings_flat_c_api_to_generic/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But we were not able to pinpoint the issue.<br/> We started migrating this service to rust mainly expecting performance gains. While rewriting in rust I was forced to think more about my code, because my code had to be written a little differently in rust. While thinking about my logic to plan the code in my head, I found some issues in the way the logic was written in Java. I fixed the logic in rust and our solution became successful and accurate. We never faced any issues after that.<br/> So the rust rewrite that was started for performance gains ended up in fixing the issues and making this service successful.</p> <p>Edit: The calculation that took 16 hours in java and was unviable, now in rust just taken 2 hours.</p> <p>Edit2: i have to admit that writing code in rust was going to take a lot of effort so i wanted to get it right before i put in so much effort. i read the old code many times and absorbed it. Then I stepped thru each step in my mind also doing dry runs. This led to a much better solution.

Rust lang book was great for looking up stuff. </p> <p>But outside the basics, learning seems too daunting. My head starts hurting whenever i decide to watch a tutorial video. Our pace doesnt seem to match, sometimes its too quick while other times its too slow. I am easy with docs and written example though, they are currently my primary sources. Still I dont feel like I am learning anything.</p> <p>The main problem is I dont know how to write or think code. I primarily started coding after the AI boom. So from start AI heavily influenced how i wrote code. But I never remember a thing when i opt for AI, not remembering syntax is ok with me but the main issue is I am not even knowing how I am writing the program, what the main things and objectives are and so on. At my state I feel like if i were to judge myself i wouldnt even hire me for a free intern.</p> <p>Currently i am writing a program to transfer files p2p using websockets. When i decided to start, o pretty quickly stumbled on how to even start it off. I had no knowledge of how it worked. I naturally searched online for some guides but the guides were pretty much 2 3 years old and outdated. I realised that just copying code wasnt enough, i actually need to study how it works. But i am feeling lost on how to start.</p> <p>So please suggest me on how i can start learning these not so basic topics cause the guides are either too outdated or completely off topic for my necessity. Currently I want to learn these networking and websocket technology and implementation in rust. So if you were in my place how would you start?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ETERNAL0013"> /u/ETERNAL0013 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2ecse/feeling_lost_on_learning_stuffs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2ecse/feeling_lost_on_learning_stuffs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/mausys/rtipc-rust">https://github.com/mausys/rtipc-rust</a></p> <p>This is a pure Rust implementation of my tiny C library: <a href="https://github.com/mausys/rtipc">https://github.com/mausys/rtipc</a></p> <p>Documentation and testing have not been completed yet, but there is a working example: <a href="https://github.com/mausys/rtipc-rust/blob/main/examples/rpc.rs">https://github.com/mausys/rtipc-rust/blob/main/examples/rpc.rs</a></p> <p>The idea behind the library is that, for processes running on the same CPU, there is no need for serialization or deserialization. Data structures can be exchanged in shared memory without copying.</p> <p>At the core of the library is a <em>single producer, single consumer, zero-copy, wait-free circular message queue</em> algorithm. The producer can force-push its messages, meaning that the oldest message in the queue is replaced by the newest one. This behavior is particularly important for real-time systems, ensuring that the consumer always has access to the most recent message.</p> <p>This made the algorithm rather complex, so I used spin/modex for verification ( <a href="https://github.com/mausys/message-queue/tree/main/spin">https://github.com/mausys/message-queue/tree/main/spin</a> ).</p> <h1>limitations</h1> <p>- fixed sized messages and queues<br/> - signaling/notification is not part of the library</p> <h1>What&#39;s next</h1> <p>Since this is my first Rust project, the library itself probably needs a lot of improvement.</p> <p>The library now exists in both C and Rust versions. C++ can use the C library directly, while other languages such as Python, Java, and Go can interface with it through C bindings. The goal is to enable processes written in different programming languages to communicate with one another.</p> <p>To achieve this, the next step will be to define a schema language and implement a code generator for the message getters and setters, similar to what is done in serialization libraries like Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers. I will likely write the schema parser/code generator in Python.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts or feedback‚Äîideas about a schema language or a code generator are especially welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maurersystems"> /u/maurersystems </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2e197/rtipc_a_realtime_inter_process_communication/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n2e197/rtipc_a_realtime_inter_process_communication/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I have coded Rust for the backend before but never in the frontend and am much more comfortable with using typescript for that. I was wondering if there is a performance or architectural benefit from using Rust for the FE, such that it becomes worth it to try and learn it? Or is the performance of the FE constrained by the underlying framework that Tauri uses?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Red-Eye-Soul"> /u/Red-Eye-Soul </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n28qse/is_there_any_advantage_to_using_rust_for_a_tauri/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1n28qse/is_there_any_advantage_to_using_rust_for_a_tauri/">[comments]</a></span></div>
