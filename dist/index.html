            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/rust">r/rust</a>! I&#39;ve been working on a high-performance quantum computing framework that I&#39;m excited to share with the community.</p> <p>**Arrow SciCompute Engine** uses Rust + Apache Arrow to achieve **19.2x-34.0x speedup** over traditional Python quantum frameworks while maintaining a beautiful Python API.</p> <p>### Key Technical Highlights</p> <p>**Architecture**: Rust core with PyO3 bindings for zero-cost Python integration</p> <p>**Memory Layout**: Apache Arrow columnar format reduces memory usage by 95%</p> <p>**Performance**: SIMD-optimized quantum operations with Rayon parallelism</p> <p>**Scale**: 86,730+ lines of production-ready code</p> <p>### The Rust Advantage</p> <p>Quantum computing simulation is computationally intensive - simulating just 20 qubits requires managing 2^20 complex numbers. Python&#39;s performance overhead becomes prohibitive at scale.</p> <p>By building the core in Rust, I achieved:</p> <p>- Memory safety for complex mathematical operations</p> <p>- Zero-cost abstractions for quantum algorithms </p> <p>- SIMD utilization for vector operations on complex numbers</p> <p>- Excellent integration with Arrow&#39;s columnar memory layout</p> <p>### Performance Results</p> <p>| Qubits | Our Framework | Qiskit | Speedup |</p> <p>|--------|---------------|--------|---------|</p> <p>| 2 | 22.65 Œºs | 430 Œºs | 19.0x |</p> <p>| 6 | 4.47 ms | 152ms | 34.0x |</p> <p>### Code Example</p> <p>Despite the Rust core, the Python API is intuitive:</p> <p>```python</p> <p>from arrow_scicompute_engine import PyQuantumArray, PyQuantumFourierTransform</p> <p>qarray = PyQuantumArray.from_amplitudes([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])</p> <p>qft = PyQuantumFourierTransform(2)</p> <p>result = qft.apply(qarray) # Executes optimized Rust code</p> <p>```</p> <p>The project showcases several interesting Rust concepts:</p> <p>- Heavy use of PyO3 for seamless Python integration</p> <p>- SIMD programming with complex number operations </p> <p>- Apache Arrow integration for columnar data</p> <p>- Rayon for work-stealing parallelism</p> <p>**Repository**: <a href="https://github.com/pallasting/arrow-scicompute-engine">https://github.com/pallasting/arrow-scicompute-engine</a></p> <p>Would love feedback from the Rust community on the architecture and implementation!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pallasting"> /u/Pallasting </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nhalsk/arrow_scicompute_engine_34x_faster_quantum/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nhalsk/arrow_scicompute_engine_34x_faster_quantum/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just published the <code>datalit</code> crate, which provides a fluent, readable DSL for generating static binary data at compile time. It&#39;s targeted at anyone writing code that has to work with structured binary data, especially to create data for tests.</p> <p>Highlights:</p> <ul> <li>Uses existing Rust literal syntax to make data easy to read.</li> <li>Handles byte order and endianness without needing to work with raw bytes.</li> <li>Allows for named labels in the data, and can generate offsets without having to manually count bytes.</li> <li>Generates data entirely at compile time, and works in <code>no_std</code> contexts.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>This creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG#File_format">PNG file header and data block</a>:</p> <p>```rust use datalit::datalit;</p> <p>let png_data = datalit!( // PNG Signature: { // High bit set to differentiate it from text files 0x89,</p> <pre><code>// Literal name in header b&quot;PNG&quot;, // DOS-style line ending to catch if a DOS-&gt;Unix text file conversion // happened. 0x0D0A, // DOS end-of-file character. 0x1A, // Unix-style line ending to catch if a Unix-&gt;DOS text file conversion // happened. 0x0A, </code></pre> <p>},</p> <p>// Set integer mode to big-endian @endian = be,</p> <p>// PNG Chunk:</p> <p>// Length of the chunk data len(&#39;chunk1): u32,</p> <p>// The PNG chunk type is a 4-byte ASCII code. b&quot;IHDR&quot;, &#39;chunk1: { // Image width 256u32, // Image height 256u32,</p> <pre><code>// Bit depth 16u8, // Color type (2 == Truecolor) 2u8, // Compression, Filter, Interlace 0u8, 0u8, 0u8 </code></pre> <p>}, // The CRC. Not supported (yet?). 0xDEADBEEF, ); ```</p> <p>Notes: no_std, no unsafe, MSRV 1.89.</p> <p>Why?: I was working on a crate for some obscure file formats and realized maintainable tests would be hard when everything is raw binary. I wanted test fixtures that are readable and reviewable yet still directly usable by the code under test. I&#39;m using this crate for that purpose, and it&#39;s worked well so far!</p> <p>If you think this could be useful, you&#39;re welcome to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/datalit">try it out</a>!

In the meantime, my library has gathered some attention, already having more than 30 starts on Github. Today, I am pleased to announce that the second (alpha) release has been successfully published to crates.io. You can view my old post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ejukow/simplefatfs_a_filesystem_library_aimed_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">here</a></p> <h1>Features</h1> <p>- The library is now fully-<code>#[no-std]</code> compliant, the only thing required is <code>alloc</code> support.</p> <p>- Most bugs have been found and patched, from my testing I would say it is safe to use it, at least for RO filesystems.</p> <p>- <code>simple-fatfs</code> uses the embedded-io crate for all its IO operations, making it embedded-friendly</p> <h1>Issues to be solved</h1> <p>The majority of the library code in endian-agnostic, which mean that the library could be run in both little and big-endian systems. The only piece of code that to my knowledge is not endian-agnostic is the <code>string_from_lfn</code> function, and that&#39;s only the case because Rust hasn&#39;t stabilized <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/116258">#116258</a></p> <p>Another major issue that I am to solve before the 0.1.0 release is the same that elm-chan&#39;s fatfs has: duplicate file open. Essentially, performing any kind of RW operation on an open object could lead to data corruption (for example, removing a directory with an open file in it)</p> <h1>Goals</h1> <p>Currently, ExFAT isn&#39;t supported, but that&#39;s on the project&#39;s TODO list.</p> <p>The aforementioned issue with duplicated file open should also be resolved when I got the time to do it</p> <p>I also aim to reduce memory usage as much as possible in the future, allowing the library to run on virtually any microprocessor</p> <h1>Contributing</h1> <p>Issues and PRs are welcome.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think the biggest downside to most turn-based games is dealing with the boredom of waiting for your turn. Chess clocks are pretty great, and play by mail is neato. Watching the other turn can be very tense. X-COM comes to mind. But I rarely see simultaneous turn.</p> <p>I&#39;ve played Diplomacy. That was really good, but very long. There was a tactics game a while back that had simultaneous moves, but all the attacks were automated, so it wasn&#39;t super satisfying. There are some hidden movement games, too, but I&#39;m not super knowledgeable about them.</p> <p>I want to make a strategy game with simultaneous turns that doesn&#39;t have twitch as a factor. Do you guys have any interesting simultaneous move strategy game examples, ideas, advice? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wadeissupercool"> /u/wadeissupercool </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngvjdj/turnbased_strategy_games_with_simultaneous_turns/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngvjdj/turnbased_strategy_games_with_simultaneous_turns/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Devs out there who have successfully migrated from AAA to Indie/not-AAA:</h1> <p>How does a AAA dev (designer) realistically migrate to a non-AAA studio, putting at risk the stability (at least in my instance) of said AAA job at the cost of finding a smaller, more passionate and creative team to work with?</p> <p><strong>Context:</strong></p> <p>Straight out of college, I was hired at a AAA studio (U.S.). Today it&#39;s been just over 3 years since I was hired, and my first ever real game I have been working on launched not too long ago. After dedicating the past 3+ years to working as hard as I could to make an impact at my studio, on the game I was making, and on the industry by proxy, I can confidently say I do not wish to stay in AAA.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the stereotypes are very true here. To put it simply, there are generally two types of people who work at the studio I work at:</p> <ol> <li>Raw, passionate game developers who want nothing more than to create the best content they can make, know and listen to their audiences, and give their all every day. They are smart, creative, have that spark when you talk to them; it is genuinely a treat to work and collaborate with these developers.</li> <li>Those who once were passionate game developers, who seemingly over the many years they have been at this studio, have been drained of a majority of that passion, and now err on the side of pessimism and expecting disappointment. They&#39;ve become content with the formulaic nature of the game(s) the studio makes -- at the end of the day, they still get to make video games for a living, and that&#39;s all they care about. They don&#39;t play games at all in the freetime, or engage with games communities -- hell, half the time they don&#39;t even play the game they are making. Simply put, they are content and out of touch.</li> </ol> <p>If I had to guess, I would say the ratio of these two types of people at my studio is 20/80 -- 20% of those are passionate, 80% of those are jaded.</p> <p>I&#39;m 25, single, and don&#39;t own a house -- as much as I would love to believe that I would never in my life become a part of that jaded 80%, the older I get and the more life throws at me, the odds of that happening will inevitably increase. While I&#39;m still young, and can afford the potential risk, what can I do to work my way into the side of the industry that genuinely cares to make games that revolutionize the industry?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Round_Cantaloupe_436"> /u/Round_Cantaloupe_436 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngujie/how_to_successfully_go_from_aaa_to_indienonaaa/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngujie/how_to_successfully_go_from_aaa_to_indienonaaa/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Maybe this is too heavy a question, but the reason I&#39;m starting to learn game dev is just because I want to make and publish a game on steam before I die. Just to be able to say I did it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve played games for as long as I can remember, so I want to put one out there just to give back in a way.</p> <p>I love 2D action-platformers, so I&#39;m making a story-driven, beat-em-up. I don&#39;t expect to make money, so I&#39;m thinking of making it free on steam, with $1 DLC people can buy if they decide they want to.</p> <p>What got you into gamedev?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KyotoCrank"> /u/KyotoCrank </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngtou1/who_got_into_game_dev_as_a_bucket_list_item/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ngtou1/who_got_into_game_dev_as_a_bucket_list_item/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I used to be a hardcore gamer at a few stages of my life. I&#39;m far more interested in making games than in playing them. But we all know that game designers should play games to increase their knowledge. I just can&#39;t get arsed to switch my Switch on (no pun intended).
