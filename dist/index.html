I could release early march, but that sounds like a bad idea because Slay the Spire 2 is releasing in Early Access around then.</p> <p>My thinking is that with only ~500 wishlists, the festival visibility + discount might matter more than a small launch discount… but I’m really not sure, and I’m afraid of messing up the launch timing.</p> <p>I’d really appreciate your thoughts.

Due to imposter syndrome I have this habit where whenever a game is announced or in development pops up in my feed, I tend to keep feeling like I could do more.

The game is no longer active, but the page is still under control of them and it did quite well but has since shut down. It was a free to play game that had millions of players but not much monetization and they couldn’t keep up with the cost. </p> <p>We’ve since joined together and formed a new studio with some extra folks and I and are building a new project under a different company.</p> <p>Would it be acceptable to post an update on that old Steam page just to let players know most of the original team are working on something new? Not positioning it as a sequel. Just more of a studio update. </p> <p>I see many posts here from others on how they successfully launched or obtained a lot of wishlists on their new game, and a common theme is that they had a previous title that helped guide followers to the new title. Our situation is similar but the team has evolved into something new with a new company and page. </p> <p>I’m mostly wondering:</p> <p>- How players typically react to that kind of post. I’m sure it will be mixed as some probably feel abandoned naturally. But some may be interested in what’s new.</p> <p>- If Steam has any platform norms around using legacy pages this way</p> <p>- If anyone here has done it and how it went</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/johnyutah"> /u/johnyutah </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4yx7y/posting_to_an_old_steam_page_about_a_new_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4yx7y/posting_to_an_old_steam_page_about_a_new_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m currently in the final stages of a project that’s been over a decade in the making. It started as a physical board game my mother and I created to compete with each other—essentially a math-based spin on the Scrabble/Words With Friends loop. After several hobbyist attempts at apps over the years, I finally got serious last year and built a full digital version using a Rails backend and a React frontend.</p> <p>The game is currently live at a development IP and is fully functional. It has user accounts, matchmaking, and AI opponents. As someone with a professional tech background, the <em>building</em> and <em>hosting</em> parts were the comfortable bits. Now that I&#39;m looking at a public release, I’m trying to understand the best next steps.</p> <p>Here are some questions I am wondering about:</p> <ul> <li>Have folks had success with self-hosting, dedicated games (i.e. not adding to a marketplace like itch.io)? What are the most effective ways folks have done acquisition? Is it worth a small ad spend, or are there better ways to seed a game with its first batch of strangers?</li> <li>At the moment I don&#39;t make any personal information mandatory for making an account (just an optional email which I intend to use for password reset). Do you&#39;all consider having to login a barrier? I <em>could</em> implement a &quot;guest&quot; option -- but trying to avoid scope creep.</li> <li>Any thoughts on browser vs mobile-native for a &quot;board game&quot;-like game? I had built a an app before, but the barriers to entry felt so high, so I kept stalling. Pivoting to browser has allowed me to actually get to a finished state.<br/></li> <li>Should I even worry about monetization? A part of me just wants to get it out there feeling polished.

Any advice on how to land a role in game dev, whether AAA or not?</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I graduated with a Computer Engineering degree and have been actively trying to break into the game industry since. Found no luck with applications or interview processes. People were barely hiring or had extremely insane requirements that I did not have. I had one internship with a non-profit organization working on a VR project in Unreal Engine. After that, I’ve found no success in much game-dev related opportunities. Besides dabbling in projects and trying to keep my skills up to date, I have been feeling a bit stuck when it comes to game dev. I’ve tried to focus on software development jobs outside of game dev and of course to no avail, the same thing. I’ve picked up skills in front-end development with HTML/CSS and React. Even went completely out of my field entirely with digital art and video production. Everything is “You were great and amazing and a strong candidate but XYZ person has more professional experience than you”. While I do know with all the mass layoffs, I am not only competing with veterans but at the same time, it always seemed like the game dev industry never liked taking on fresh newcomers anyway. It feels like I could have many specialized projects but if they were not officially shipped with some team then I’m just fucked. </p> <p>Just looking at what the best game plan is going forward for me to keep going forward with game dev. I am just trying to get some professional experience so I can be taken seriously. It just feels like the more years that pass, the experience, projects and degree I have gained just becomes obsolete and not applicable. With the over-saturated market, the terrible economy and how the pandemic changed the game, I had no choice to just get some kind of good enough job to sustain living and keep me somewhat relevant to my career. Right now I work in tech retail. Last year I just came out of a terrible living situation and it was basically my saving grace. Now that I have some stability now, I can re-focus my attention on my actual career. </p> <p>Currently I’m narrowing down my specialization in game dev. I’ve built skills over the years as both a gameplay programmer in C# with Unity and C++ with Unreal. Fundamentally outside of game-dev, my programming skills reside with Python and C++. Aside from that, I’ve also built projects as a 3D artist. So I’m narrowing down between these two. Some have suggested to me that I should consider Technical Art roles as a bridge between the two. It’s something I’m looking into but not sure yet.</p> <p>In terms of next steps, I am heading to GDC as a jump start next month so hopefully that helps. If anyone can provide any insight, that would be great! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chipsundae_supreme"> /u/chipsundae_supreme </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4utr0/4_years_postgrad_with_a_cs_degree_from_a_top/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4utr0/4_years_postgrad_with_a_cs_degree_from_a_top/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I should have tracked this better.</p> <p>Maybe not so helpful data:</p> <p>My blended traffic is 127 wishlist adds ÷ 12,136 visits = 1.05% which is weighed down by junky TikTok clicks. If someone isn’t signed into Steam it’s not going to convert and that’s even if they’re actually interested in wishlisting.</p> <p>127 ÷ 1,763 store visits = 7.2%. Again obviously not completely accurate given a majority likely came from external.</p> <p>What is perhaps more helpful:</p> <p>Jan 16 – Feb 1 (Pre-Ad Window)</p> <p>Traffic</p> <p>2,334 total visits</p> <p>599 Steam Store</p> <p>1,703 External</p> <p>Wishlists</p> <p>104 additions</p> <p>26 deletions</p> <p>78 net</p> <p>If during that period:</p> <p>50 came from store traffic ÷ 599 = 8.3%</p> <p>31 came from store traffic ÷ 599 = 5.1%</p> <p>My summary is that:</p> <p>\-100 wishlists suck after 1 month</p> <p>\-But what’s coming from the store is pretty good conversion</p> <p>\-But what’s coming externally is huge traffic volume but not good conversion</p> <p>So it’s entirely possible a) my page is not great, my game is not great but it’s also possible b) that I’ve done a shit ton of external marketing to the wrong audiences or c) I should be cautiously optimistic that with TD fest coming up that I should see good conversion in the store or d) a combo of all of the above</p> <p>Thank you for coming to my shitty TED talk!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/plainviewbowling"> /u/plainviewbowling </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4uda3/my_data_deep_dive_after_1_month_and_only_100_net/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4uda3/my_data_deep_dive_after_1_month_and_only_100_net/">[comments]</a></span></div>

A bunch of creators (including some pretty large ones like Insym) have played it, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.</p> <p>The demo has a 100% positive review score on Steam and the game is still sitting at under 1,000 wishlists.</p> <p>I’m not posting this to complain I genuinely want to understand what I might be doing wrong.</p> <p>From my perspective the demo is free and polished, big creators covered it, players who tried it seem to really like it and reviews are extremely positive but the wishlist count just isn’t moving much.</p> <p>Is this just normal? Is conversion from YouTube views to wishlists way lower than I expect? Does Steam visibility not really snowball unless you’re already past a certain threshold? Or is there something fundamentally off about the steam page/art/genre?</p> <p>If anyone has experienced something similar as in good demo reception but low wishlist growth I’d love to hear what you learned.</p> <p>Trying to approach this analytically rather than emotionally.

Generally speaking, the <code>#[allow(non_snake_case)]</code> helps to ensure that the generated tests don&#39;t have any name issues, but I&#39;ve also included it to show that generated tests inherit attributes of the original test.</p> <pre><code>#[matrix_parameterized_test( types = [ Type1, Type2&lt;U&gt;, ], args = [ (0, &quot;0&quot;), (1, &quot;1&quot;), ], named_args = [ (&quot;test2&quot;, (2, &quot;2&quot;)), (&quot;test3&quot;, (3, &quot;3&quot;)), ], )] #[allow(non_snake_case) fn test_matrix&lt;T: Trait&gt;((a: usize, b: &amp;str)) { ... } </code></pre> <p>The above would then generate the following test cases:</p> <pre><code>test_matrix_type_1__0_0_&lt;Type1&gt;((0, &quot;0&quot;)) test_matrix_type_1__1_1_&lt;Type1&gt;((1, &quot;1&quot;)) test_matrix_type_1__test_0_&lt;Type1&gt;((2, &quot;2&quot;)) test_matrix_type_1__test_1_&lt;Type1&gt;((3, &quot;3&quot;)) test_matrix_type_2_u__0_0_&lt;Type2&lt;U&gt;&gt;((0, &quot;0&quot;)) test_matrix_type_2_u__1_1_&lt;Type2&lt;U&gt;&gt;((1, &quot;1&quot;)) test_matrix_type_2_u__test_0_&lt;Type2&lt;U&gt;&gt;((2, &quot;2&quot;)) test_matrix_type_2_u__test_1_&lt;Type1&lt;U&gt;&gt;((3, &quot;3&quot;)) </code></pre> <p>I&#39;ve also created similar macros for <code>#value_parameterized_test</code> and <code>#type_parameterized_test</code> to generate tests for cases in which one or the other isn&#39;t necessary. The value parameterized tests currently only support a single argument, so multiple arguments must be wrapped in a tuple.</p> <p>For reference the library is available at <a href="https://github.com/amadavan/ptest-macros">https://github.com/amadavan/ptest-macros</a> and any feedback is appreciated.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a software engineer and I&#39;ve always been into teaching. Back in school I helped run a company that tutored kids aged 8-14 to code, bootcamp / hackathon style. Watching them go from confused to building things was genuinely one of my favorite experiences.</p> <p>I&#39;m also someone who learns best by doing, not watching. I want to understand why something works, not just copy-paste it. The problem is, when I sit down to learn something new, let&#39;s say compression algorithms, or how to build an LRU cache, I can read about it, but how do I know what I&#39;ve written actually works? Not everything comes with tests. And I&#39;m not always confident I&#39;ve got it right.</p> <p>That&#39;s where this project came from. What if AI could generate the tests and hints, and I just focus on learning and solving? Work through it at my own pace, actually digest the material. Then I figured... why not make it available to others too.</p> <p><strong>So here&#39;s the gist:</strong> </p> <p>You describe a topic, it generates a set of failing Rust tests with starter code, and your job is to make them pass. Progressive hints if you get stuck. Basically LeetCode but you pick the topic and challenges are generated on the fly.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Full rust-analyzer LSP in the browser (autocomplete, hover docs, diagnostics)</li> <li>Sandboxed code execution via Docker (256MB, 30s timeout, no network)</li> <li>Vim mode if that&#39;s your thing</li> <li>Challenge history and progress tracking</li> </ul> <p>Built with Axum + React + Monaco. AI helped me build it - not going to pretend otherwise. Still took a solid amount of my own time getting everything wired together.</p> <p>I&#39;ve got about $10 of API credits loaded for challenge generation so it won&#39;t last forever, and I plan to take the server down in about 1-2 weeks. I don&#39;t want to keep user data around on something I don&#39;t consider fully production ready. This is a trial run though — if people actually find it useful I&#39;ll figure out how to sustain it properly.</p> <p>Would genuinely love to hear what kinds of challenges work well and what falls flat. Also open to any thoughts on what could be improved — whether that&#39;s test generation, the hints, or the overall experience.

I&#39;ve always loved typestate patterns, but it&#39;s always seemed like people never fully exploited them — which makes sense because it gets very complex once you start doing multiple combinations of states vs just handling one generic. But I pushed through until I got some rough idea of what felt nice.</p> <p>The goal was to let users have as close to the API as drizzle-orm and also let users keep the expected CLI/migrations folders so they could either easily swap from a TypeScript base to Rust, or easily let their workspace have both and not have to worry about maintaining different kinds of migrations for each lang.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have the query API yet, but this is how the sql-like API looks. This is for turso, but it works with rusqlite, libsql, postgres-sync, and tokio-postgres.</p> <p>Hope you guys like it, its been nice to play with so far.

Even though this seems a very straightforward task, implementing it is a pain if you want to support multiple platforms, since each one has its OS-specific directories, data structure, and APIs (most of them written in C).</p> <p>The fact that there is no other existing Rust library to do this task is what originally made me start develop this library 2 years ago, and I&#39;m happy to see that it now has multiple public dependants, because it means that this problem is shared among other people / projects.</p> <p>I faced this same issue in two different contexts: at my job, and while trying to implement <a href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/issues/170">process identification for Sniffnet</a> (I&#39;m Sniffnet&#39;s maintainer).</p> <p>I&#39;m particularly excited about this <a href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/listeners/releases/tag/v0.4.0">release</a> for three reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Support for FreeBSD (in addition to the already existing support for Windows, Linux, and macOS) was introduced thanks to my colleague <a href="https://github.com/antoncxx">Anton</a>. To my knowledge there is no existing crate at all that does something similar on FreeBSD and this adds a huge value to the library, even if at the moment we&#39;re using bindings to C for this.</li> <li>I&#39;ve spent the past week&#39;s nights testing and adding exhaustive benchmarks that allowed to considerably improve the APIs performance. I had so much fun using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/criterion">criterion</a> to benchmark it under different system loads, and I&#39;ve made the results generation completely automated on GitHub Actions runners for all the supported platforms. You can find the results and charts on the <a href="https://github.com/GyulyVGC/listeners?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks">README&#39;s Benchmarks section</a>.</li> <li>Thanks to point 2, I now judge the library mature, fast, and reliable enough for use in Sniffnet. I&#39;ve already drafted a PR and I&#39;m so excited that in-app process support is finally coming I hope in about a couple months.</li> </ol> <p>Needless to say that you&#39;re more than welcome to contribute to the library trying to make it even faster, or adding support for more Operating Systems (NetBSD, OpenBSD, or even iOS and Android, why not!).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GyulyVGC"> /u/GyulyVGC </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r4qw29/listeners_v040_a_crossplatform_rust_library_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1r4qw29/listeners_v040_a_crossplatform_rust_library_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>I am the creator of <strong>GoPdfSuit</strong>, and I have been focused on building a Go-native PDF engine that prioritizes extreme throughput without sacrificing compliance. We are currently at stable version 4.2.0, and I am looking for technical feedback on the next phase of development.</p> <h1>Performance Benchmarks</h1> <p>The engine is designed for high-concurrency environments. Testing on a 24-core Linux machine (Go 1.24.0) yields the following results for a standard 2-page financial report:</p> <ul> <li><strong>With Image Caching Enabled:</strong> ~1,500 ops/sec.</li> <li><strong>With Image Caching Disabled:</strong> 600–700 ops/sec.</li> </ul> <p>This output is a production-ready document fully compliant with <strong>PDF/UA-2</strong> (Universal Accessibility) and <strong>PDF/A-4</strong> (Archiving). It is Arlington PDF Model compatible and includes full font glyph embedding, digital signatures, hierarchical bookmarks, and internal cross-linking.</p> <h1>The Zerodha Gold Standard Benchmark</h1> <p>To test real-world fintech complexity, I ran a benchmark simulating a Zerodha-style workload mix (Retail, Active, and HFT tiers). Notably, Zerodha uses <strong>Typst</strong> as their internal template engine, which has influenced the technical direction of this project.<br/> We did comparison with zerodha as they did 1.5M pdf in 25 minutes (<a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/1-5-million-pdfs-in-25-minutes/">link</a>) which included the network IO as well, even with network IO (simulated) GoPDFSuit was around 400-500 ops/sec.</p> <p>Bash</p> <pre><code>$ cd ./sampledata/gopdflib/zerodha $ go run . === Zerodha Gold Standard Benchmark === Workload Mix: 80% Retail | 15% Active | 5% HFT OS: linux, Arch: amd64, NumCPU: 24, GoVersion: go1.24.0 Running 5000 iterations using 48 workers... === Performance Summary === Throughput: 514.80 ops/sec Avg Latency: 90.253 ms Max Memory: 1061.39 MB === Workload Distribution === Retail (80%): 4011 iterations Active (15%): 708 iterations HFT (5%): 281 iterations </code></pre> <h1>How to use GoPdfSuit</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Web-Based Editor:</strong> You can use it on the web for free to create templates or actual PDFs. Login via Google is required solely for generating a GCP token; no authentication information is stored.</li> <li><strong>Self-Hosted SaaS:</strong> It can be deployed as a standalone service using the provided Dockerfile.</li> <li><strong>Library Support:</strong> Based on feedback regarding resource costs, I provide native library support via <strong>gopdflib</strong> for Go and <strong>pypdfsuit</strong> for Python to allow for direct integration into your codebase.</li> </ol> <h1>Feedback Requested: Native Math Rendering</h1> <p>The next major milestone is implementing native math syntax rendering (integrals, differentiation, etc.). Currently, users must convert math to a base64 image externally. I want to eliminate this step.</p> <p>I am deciding between two approaches:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Typst Syntax:</strong> Modern, efficient, and aligns with the &quot;fast&quot; philosophy of Go. Since companies like Zerodha use it internally, it seems like a strong candidate.</li> <li><strong>LaTeX Syntax:</strong> The legacy industry standard, but significantly more complex to parse natively in Go.</li> </ol> <p><strong>My questions for the community:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Which would you prefer ?</li> <li>If you have your use case specific or alternative to the above approach do let me know in the comments.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Sample Data:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit/tree/master/sampledata">github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit/tree/master/sampledata</a></p> <p><strong>Documentation -</strong> <a href="https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/#/documentation">https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/#/documentation</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chinmay06"> /u/chinmay06 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/#/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r4g7ew/build_a_gopdfsuit_pdf_engine_ultra_fast_seeking/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about the workflow for understanding what queries your Go app is actually executing — especially when using an ORM like GORM or Ent, or even plain <code>database/sql</code> with a query builder.</p> <p>The common approaches I&#39;ve seen:</p> <ol> <li><strong>ORM debug logging</strong> — <code>db.Debug()</code> in GORM, etc. Works but clutters stdout, hard to filter, and you have to change your code.</li> <li><strong>Database query log</strong> — <code>log_statement = &#39;all&#39;</code> in PostgreSQL, general log in MySQL. Noisy, requires DB config changes, and you lose the context of &quot;which request triggered this.&quot;</li> <li><strong>Middleware / custom driver wrapper</strong> — wrap <code>database/sql</code> to log queries. Requires code changes and doesn&#39;t always capture prepared statement parameters cleanly.</li> <li><strong>pgBadger / pt-query-digest</strong> — great for production analysis, but overkill for &quot;let me quickly check what this handler does.&quot;</li> </ol> <p>What&#39;s your go-to approach? Especially interested in:</p> <ul> <li>How do you spot N+1 queries during development?</li> <li>How do you check execution plans (EXPLAIN) for queries generated by an ORM?</li> <li>Do you have a workflow for &quot;run the app, trigger a request, see all the SQL it produced&quot;?</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>I ended up building a small tool for this: <a href="https://github.com/mickamy/sql-tap">sql-tap</a>. It&#39;s a transparent proxy that sits between your app and PostgreSQL/MySQL, parses the wire protocol, and shows all queries in a TUI in real-time. You can also run EXPLAIN on any captured query directly from the terminal. No code changes needed — just change the port your app connects to.</p> <p>Curious to hear how others approach this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ComprehensiveDisk394"> /u/ComprehensiveDisk394 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r4b0y9/how_do_you_debuganalyze_the_sql_your_go_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1r4b0y9/how_do_you_debuganalyze_the_sql_your_go_app/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It has great self hosting documentation and it&#39;s REALLY cheap to run, like 10-100x cheaper than alternatives. I&#39;m not selling you anything and I&#39;m hoping to get some feedback on what&#39;s missing and if it&#39;s something that other people need as well.</p> <p>Now let me tell you what it is, it&#39;s an APM/observability/ issue tracking platform. It&#39;s called Traceway, you add into the app as single library with a 1 line config and it gives you: </p> <ol> <li>Endpoint performance tracking (gives you descent SLOs by default)</li> <li>Error tracking (like Sentry)</li> <li>Task execution tracking (scheduled/async jobs executions)</li> <li>Go and Server level metrics</li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s mostly aimed at side projects and startups that don&#39;t have a devops team, it has traces, spans, attributes and deep integrations with both the standard library and the popular golang frameworks.</p> <p>I really like using it, it&#39;s saving me a bunch of time but I&#39;d like some help: What are you using currently? Why wouldn&#39;t you use it? Is it even a problem for you?</p> <p>Hosting it yourself is really easy, but if you want to try it I also built a cloud hosted version that has a free tier that supports 10k issues/traces.</p> <p>Let me know if you&#39;re interested in trying it out, I am just looking for feedback and hopefully someone else with the same problem who&#39;d be interested in contributing.
