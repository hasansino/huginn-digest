As such, I&#39;ve started watching many videos about how to be successful. Sadly, most of the videos are very negative and say things like you have to reach out to 1000 streamers and have beautiful art and be in the correct genre. I felt pretty good about the situation until I started watching all these videos. I was wondering what others&#39; thoughts are on this. Is it really that hard? My game is a pixel art action rpg, which is kind of in the middle of what they say will be successful on steam (with puzzle games and platformers being the worst). Any insight would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhiteSheepGame"> /u/WhiteSheepGame </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kq0y1x/is_it_really_that_hard_to_have_success_on_steam/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kq0y1x/is_it_really_that_hard_to_have_success_on_steam/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I wanted something to hook players who either have an unwarranted hate for turn based and get them to maybe like/at least try out my game. Tdlr what would make you want to start a turn based game, keep playing it, and not get tired of the combat loop? Edit: Sorry for not specifically saying what type of turn based game I meant (well any kinda works but) rpg turn based the kind where you have a party you have skills etc. (example darkest dungeon, chrono trigger, bravely default)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/VoidEndless"> /u/VoidEndless </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kpv56h/how_would_you_improve_turn_based_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kpv56h/how_would_you_improve_turn_based_games/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The post got downvoted to hell (not surprising, as that happened last time as well), and previously I assumed it was because the game wasn&#39;t appealing, the Steam page was confusing or poorly messaged, or they didn&#39;t like the art style.</p> <p>Then, someone made a comment that our company name sucks. That comment ended up getting more net upvotes than the post itself.</p> <p>Our company name is Neurodivergent Studios - Neurodiversity is something that&#39;s important to us, as many of us and our loved ones are varying degrees of neurodivergent (both diagnosed and undiagnosed). But after seeing that comment (I know that some people are just trolls, but all of the upvotes don&#39;t lie), I&#39;m second guessing the decision.</p> <p>Is it because it&#39;s a taboo topic? I see sometimes on social media the whole &quot;stop calling yourself neurodivergent, you&#39;re just quirky&quot; movement.</p> <p>Anyways, time to google &quot;how difficult is it to change company name&quot;.</p> <p>[EDIT]: Alright, looks like the comments range from &quot;that&#39;s a terrible name&quot; / &quot;it&#39;s too controversial&quot; to &quot;it&#39;s fine&quot;, which is not good. Although well intended, it looks like we picked a controversial word. We&#39;ll likely change the name, or tone it down in some ways.

The fun part? It lets you write templates using familiar PHP-like syntax ‚Äî and then it translates that into Go‚Äôs html/template format.</p> <p>&#39;&#39;&#39;go</p> <p>{{ if .ShowSection }} &lt;p&gt;Hello, {{ .Name }}&lt;/p&gt; {{ end }}</p> <p>&#39;&#39;&#39;</p> <p>you can write this &#39;&#39;&#39;php &lt;?php if $showSection ?&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;?= $name ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;?php endif ?&gt; &#39;&#39;&#39;</p> <p>It‚Äôs totally optional, and the idea was to make writing views feel more natural ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre coming from a PHP background (which I did). I know Go templates are powerful, but sometimes they can be a bit clunky when you‚Äôre just trying to ship something simple.</p> <p>Why I did this: ‚Ä¢ I wanted a faster, more intuitive way to build frontend pages in Go. ‚Ä¢ I missed the simplicity of PHP templating from my early dev days. ‚Ä¢ And honestly, it was just a fun challenge to build a parser that ‚Äúfeels like PHP‚Äù but compiles to Go templates.</p> <p>Links if you‚Äôre curious: ‚Ä¢ üîß Server package: <a href="https://github.com/vrianta/Server">https://github.com/vrianta/Server</a> ‚Ä¢ üíº Portfolio site source: <a href="https://github.com/pritam-is-next/resume">https://github.com/pritam-is-next/resume</a></p> <p>Still very much a work in progress ‚Äî would love to hear what you think.

I felt like both of those projects weren‚Äôt written in very ‚Äúidiomatic‚Äù go code, so i decided to follow along with the ‚Äúwriting an interpreter in go‚Äù book to get a better idea of what an interpreter would look like using more standard go language features. </p> <p>One thing that shocked me about the book is the sheer amount of tests that are implemented for every part of the interpreter, and the fact you are often writing tests before you even define or implement the types/procedures that you are testing against. I guess i was just wondering, is this how i should always be writing go code? Writing the tests up front, and then writing the actual implementation after? i can definitely see the benefits of this approach, i guess i‚Äôm just wondering at what point should i start writing tests vs just focusing on implementation. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable-Course-88"> /u/Inevitable-Course-88 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kpueqy/question_about_tests/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kpueqy/question_about_tests/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve created a &quot;tune API&quot; for the next version of <strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ</a></strong>. Essentially, &quot;Tune&quot; allows you to increase or decrease the size of the worker/thread pool at runtime.</p> <p>For example, when the load on your server is high, you&#39;ll need to process more concurrent jobs. Conversely, when the load is low, you don&#39;t need as many workers, because workers consume resources.</p> <p>Therefore, based on your custom logic, you can dynamically change the worker pool size using this tune API.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/XQZtr9DxCsw">In this video</a>, I&#39;ve <strong>enqueued 1000 jobs</strong> into <strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ</a></strong>, and I&#39;ve set the initial worker pool size to <strong>10</strong> (the concurrency value).</p> <p>Every second, using the tune API, I&#39;m increasing the worker pool size by 10 until it <strong>reaches 100</strong>.</p> <p>Once it reaches a size of <strong>100</strong>, then I start removing <strong>10 workers</strong> at a time from the pool.</p> <p>This way, I&#39;m decreasing and then increasing the worker pool size.</p> <p>Cool, right?</p> <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ</a></strong> primarily uses its own <strong>Event-Loop</strong> internally to handle this concurrency. </p> <p>This event loop checks if there are any pending jobs in the queue and if any workers are available in the worker pool. If there are, it distributes jobs to all available workers and then goes back into sleep mode.</p> <p>When a worker becomes free, it then tells the event loop, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m free now; if you have any jobs, you can give them to me.&quot;</p> <p>The event loop then checks again if there are any pending jobs in the queue. If there are, it continues to distribute them to the workers.</p> <p>This is <strong><a href="https://github.com/goptics/varmq">VarMQ&#39;s</a></strong> concurrency model.</p> <p>Feel Free to share your thoughts.

However, more and more of the standard library is becoming const.</p> <p>Every release includes APIs that are now available in const. At some point, we will get <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3762">const traits</a>.</p> <p>Assume everything that <em>can</em> be marked <code>const</code> in std <strong>will be</strong>, at some point.</p> <p>Crates are encouraged to use <code>const fn</code> instead of <code>fn</code> where possible. There is even a clippy lint <code>missing_const_for_fn</code> to enforce this.</p> <p>But what if everything possible in <code>std</code> is <code>const</code>? That means most crates could also have <code>const fn</code> for <strong>everything</strong>. Crates usually don&#39;t do IO (such as reading or writing files), that&#39;s on the user.</p> <p>Essentially, if you see where I am going with this. When 95% of functions in Rust are <code>const</code>, would it not make more sense to have <code>const</code> be by default?</p> <p>Computation happens on runtime and slows down code. This computation can happen during compilation instead.</p> <p>Rust&#39;s keyword markers such as <code>async</code>, <code>unsafe</code>, <code>mut</code> all <strong>add</strong> functionality. <code>const</code> is the only one which <em>restricts</em> functionality.</p> <p>Instead of <code>const fn</code>, we can have <code>fn</code> which is implicitly const. To allow IO such as reading to a file, you need to use <code>dyn fn</code> instead. </p> <p>Essentially, <code>dyn fn</code> allows you to call <code>dyn fn</code> functions such as <code>std::fs::read</code> as well as <code>fn</code> (const functions, which will be most of them)</p> <p>This effectively &quot;flips&quot; const and non-const.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I started learning Rust two months ago and I developed a new <a href="https://crates.io/crates/freightview">app</a> that is similar to the <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">dive tool</a> and allows to inspect docker containers. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/GeorgiiKrikun/FreightView">Github link</a>. You can install it with `cargo install freightview` and run with `freightview your-img:your-tag`. </p> <p>I won&#39;t say it&#39;s blazing fast, because it has a lot of room to improve, but it is definitely faster than original, and, using serde, I was able to cache some layers to speed up startup by avoiding constant parcing the file tree that the original does. If you inspect the same image that you already inspected, this translates to less than a second startup even for large 5-10 Gb Images. As someone working in Computer Vision where large models (&gt;10 Gb) are often part of a container image, this is a pure blessing.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xray-tui">these guys</a> have beat me to it with their `xray-tui` app , by publishing similar app a week ago :D. As a beginner, I obviously can&#39;t compete with them since they definitely have more experience with Rust. Their app is definitely better feature wise and it also looks better, so I encourage you to check it out too if you haven&#39;t seen it yet. However, if you need a reason to check my app out, it has more permissive MIT license instead of GPL.</p> <p>In the following, I want to share my experience with Rust so far after these two months.</p> <p>Positives:</p> <ol> <li>Great ecosystem. Seriously, ecosystem is the best I have ever seen. Publishing crate was a breeze, compiling, testing and debugging with it was not complicated and very intuitive.</li> <li>Great tools that are easy to install. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bottom">bottom</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fd-find">fd-find</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bat">bat</a> are now always installed on my machines.</li> <li>Great community. Goes without saying, some people here helped me a lot when I struggled to implement trees in rust. They suggested me to use `Rc&lt;RefCell&gt;` for the tree nodes, without them the project would have never seen a light.</li> <li>Great refactoring. I really like that if my project compiles it runs without an issue. Logical errors exist, but they will always be there. Apart from that, I LOVE when the app compiles and it just runs. </li> <li>Rust-analyzer is great. Did not have any problems with it, that I often have with the Clang or Pylance.</li> <li>Language is really concise and well thought through. If I think something should exists to ease my life, the function or the method is in 99 out of 100 cases already there.</li> </ol> <p>I had however some small issues with the language that I also want to note:</p> <ol> <li>Tests compiling into the binary with random crap appended in the end. I don&#39;t understand why such decision has been made by a dev team. Makes it, well, not hard, but relatively annoying to start tests with GDB. There are also multiple such executables with crap at the end in the test folder, so finding your test executable is hard.</li> <li>I can see some scenarios where everything in the app might become Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt; and becomes pain in the butt to work with. Maybe, scenarios are just in my head, but I have a little fear that this could seriously impair some project.</li> <li>I miss some OOP features. I like traits, don&#39;t get me wrong, but sometimes I miss something like a common variable, not method, among multiple classes. For example, If I wanted for each struct in my app to have a `created` timestamp, I would need to define the variable that holds timestamp for each particular instance of the struct. Maybe it is solvable with macros system but I did not touch them yet.</li> <li>Prototyping is not easy. Basically, Rust forces your app to be production-ready</li> </ol> <p>My verdict - I totally overslept the release of this great language and I am kinda disappointed with myself. It is not just a hype, it is a fantastic tool. I still have a lot to learn and I will probably continue working on the app.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GeorgiiKrikun"> /u/GeorgiiKrikun </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kpptd1/i_made_an_app_that_allows_to_inspect_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kpptd1/i_made_an_app_that_allows_to_inspect_the/">[comments]</a></span></div>

We built it to mainly support RAG, where both similarity and relationship queries are need.</p> <p>Why hybrid?<br/> Vector DBs are great for semantic search (e.g., embeddings), while graph DBs are needed for representing relationships (e.g., people ‚Üí projects ‚Üí organisations). Certain RAG systems need both, but combining two separate databases can be a nightmare and hard-to-maintain.</p> <p>HelixDB treats vectors as first-class types within a property graph model. Think of vector nodes connected to other nodes like in any graph DB, which allows you to traverse from a person to their documents to a semantically similar report in one query.</p> <p>Currently we are on par with Pinecone and Qdrant for vector search and between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude faster than Neo4j.<br/> As Rust developers, we were tired of the type ambiguity in most query languages. So we also built HelixQL, a type-safe query language that compiles into Rust code and runs as native endpoints. Traversals are functional (like Gremlin), the language is imperative, and the syntax is modelled after Rust with influences from Cypher and SQL. It‚Äôs schema-based, so everything‚Äôs type-checked up front.</p> <p>We‚Äôve been refining the graph engine to support pipelined and parallel traversals‚Äîonly loading data from disk when needed and streaming intermediate results efficiently.</p> <p>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Here‚Äôs a quick <a href="https://screen.studio/share/szgQu3yq">video walkthrough</a>.<br/> üíª Or try the <a href="https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db/tree/main/examples/rag_demo">demo notebook</a>.</p> <p>Would love your feedback‚Äîespecially from other folks building DBs or doing AI infra in Rust.

It&#39;s obviously a fake, but I have a story that bears resemblance to parts of the AI slop in relation to Rust&#39;s project success being its&#39; death in a company. Also, I can&#39;t sleep, I&#39;m on painkillers, after a surgery a few days ago, so I have some time to kill until I get sleepy again, so here it goes.</p> <p>A few years ago I&#39;ve been working at a unicorn startup that was growing extremely fast during the pandemic. The main application was written in Ruby on Rails, and some video tooling was written in Node.js, but we didn&#39;t have any usage of a fast compiled language like Rust or Go. A few months after I joined we had to implement a real-time service that would allow us to get information who is online (ie. a green dot on a profile), and what the users are doing (for example: N users are viewing presentation X, M users is in are in a marketing booth etc). Not too complex, but with the expected growth we were aiming at 100k concurrent users to start with. Which again, is not *that* hard, but most of the people involved agreed Ruby is not the best choice for it.</p> <p>A discussion to choose the language started. The team tasked with writing the service chose Rust, but the management was not convinced, so they proposed they would write a few proof of concept services, one in a different language: Elixir, Rust, Ruby, and Node.js. I&#39;m honestly not sure why Go wasn&#39;t included as I was on vacation at the time, and I think it could have been a viable choice. Anyways, after a week or so the proof of concepts were finished and we&#39;ve benchmarked them. I was not on the team doing them, but I was involved with many performance and observability related tasks, so I was helping with benchmarking the solutions. The results were not surprising: Rust was the fastest, with the lowest memory footprint, then was Elixir, Node.js, and Ruby. With a caveat that the Node.js version would have to be eventually distributed cause of the single threaded runtime, which we were already maxing on a relatively small servers. Another interesting thing is that the Rust version had an issue caused by how the developer was using async futures sending messages to clients - it was looping through all of the clients to get the list of channels to send to, which was blocking the runtime for a few seconds under heavy load. Easy to fix, if you know what you&#39;re doing, but a beginner would get it right in Go or Elixir more likely than in Rust. Although maybe not a fair point cause other proof of concepts were all written by people with prior language experience, only the Rust PoC was written by a first-time Rust developer.</p> <p>After discussing the benchmarks, ergonomics of the languages, the fit in the company, and a few other things, the team chose Rust again. Another interesting thing - the person who wrote the Rust PoC was originally voting for Elixir as he had prior Elixir experience, but after the PoC he voted for Rust. In general, I think the big part of the reason why Rust has been chosen was also its&#39; versatility. Not only the team viewed it as a good fit for networking and web services, but also we could have potentially used it for extending or sharing code between Node.js, Ruby, and eventually other languages we might end up with (like: at this point we knew there are talks about acquiring a startup written in Python). We were also discussing writing SDKs for our APIs in multiple langauges, which was another potentially interesting use case - write the core in Rust, add wrappers for Ruby, Python, Node.js etc.</p> <p>The proof of concepts took a bit of time, so we were time pressed, and instead of the original plan of the team writing the service, I was asked to do that as I had prior Rust experience. I was working with the Rust PoC author, and I was doing my best to let him write as much code as possible, with frequent pair programming sessions.</p> <p>Because of the time constraints I wanted to keep things as simple as possible, so I proposed a database-like solution. With a simple enough workload, managing 100k connections in Rust is not a big deal. For the MVP we also didn&#39;t need any advanced features: mainly ask if a user with a given id is online and where they are in the app. If user disconnects, it means they&#39;re offline. If the service dies, we restart it, and let the clients reconnect. Later on we were going to add events like &quot;user_online&quot; or &quot;user_entered_area&quot; etc, but that didn&#39;t sound like a big deal either. We would keep everything in memory for real-time usage, and push events to Kafka for later processing. So the service was essentially a WebSocket based API wrapping a few hash maps in memory.</p> <p>We had a first version ready for production in two weeks. We deployed it after one or two weeks more, that we needed for the SRE team to prepare the infrastructure. Two servers with a failover - if the main server fails we switch all of the clients to the secondary. In the following month or so we&#39;ve added a few more features and the service was running without any issues at expected loads of &lt;100k users.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the plans within the company changed, and we&#39;ve been asked to put the service into maintenance mode as the company didn&#39;t want to invest more into real time features. So we checked the alerting, instrumentation etc, left the service running, and grudgingly got back to our previous teams, and tasks. The service was running uninterrupted for the next few months. No errors, no bugs, nothing, a dream for the infrastructure team.</p> <p>After a few months the company was preparing for a big event with expected peak of 500k concurrent users. As me and the other author of the service were busy with other stuff, the company decided to hire 3 Rust developers to bring the Rust service up to expected performance. The new team got to benchmarking and they found a few bottlenecks. Outside the service. After a bit of kernel settings tweaking, changing the load balancer configuration etc. the service was able to handle 1M concurrent users with p99=10ms, and 2M concurrent users with p99=25ms or so. I don&#39;t remember the exact numbers, but it was in this ballpark, on a 64 core (or so) machine.</p> <p>That&#39;s where the problems started. When the leadership made the decision to hire the Rust developers, the director responsible for the decision was in favour of expanding Rust usage, but when a company grows from 30 to 1000 people in a year, frequent reorgs, team changes, and title changes are inevitable. The new director, responsible for the project at the time it was evaluated for performance, was not happy with it. His biggest problem? If there was no additional work needed for the service, we had three engineers with nothing to do!</p> <p>Now, while that sounds like a potential problem, I&#39;ve seen it as an opportunity. A few other teams were already interested in starting to use Rust for their code, with what I thought were legitimately good use cases for Rust usage, like for example processing events to gather analytics, or a real time notification service. I need to add, two out of the three Rust devs were very experienced, with background in fin-tech and distributed systems. So we&#39;ve made a case for expanding Rust usage in the company. Unfortunately the director responsible for the decision was adamant. He didn&#39;t budge at all, and shortly after the discussion started he told the Rust devs to better learn Ruby or Node.js or start looking for a new job. A huge waste, in my opinion, as they all left not long after, but there was not much we could do.</p> <p>Now, to be absolutely fair, I understand some of the arguments behind the decision, like, for example, Rust being a relatively niche language at that time (2020 or so), and we had way more developers knowing Node.js and Ruby than Rust. But then there were also risks involved in banning Rust usage, like, what to do with the sole Rust service? With entire teams eager to try Rust for their services, and with 3 devs ready to help with the expansion, I know what would be my answer, but alas that never came to be.</p> <p>What&#39;s the funniest part of the story, and the part that resembles the main point of the AI slop article, is that if the Rust service wasn&#39;t as successful, the company would have probably kept the Rust team. If, let&#39;s say, they had to spend months on optimising the service, which was the case in a lot of the other services in the company, no one would have blinked an eye. Business as usual, that&#39;s just how things are. And then, eventually, new features were needed, but the Rust team never get that far (which was also an ongoing problem in the company - we need a feature X, it would be easiest to implement it in the Rust service, but the Rust service has no team... oh well, I guess we will hack around it with a sub-optimal solution that would take considerably more time and that would be considerably more complex than modifying the service in question).</p> <p>Now a small bonus, what happened after? Shortly after the decision about banning Rust for any new stuff, the decision was also made to rewrite the Rust service into Node.js in order to allow existing teams to maintain it. There was one attempt taken that failed. Now, to be completely fair, I am aware that it *is* possible to write such a service in Node.js. The problem is, though, a single Node.js process can&#39;t handle this kind of load cause of the runtime characteristics (single thread, with limited ability to offload tasks to service workers, which is simply not enough). Which also means, the architecture would have to be changed. No longer a single process, single server setup, but multiple processes synced through some kind of a service, database, or a queue. As far as I remember the person doing the rewrite decided to use a hosted service called Ably, to not have to handle WebSocket connections manually, but unfortunately after 2 months or so, it turned out the solution was not nearly performant enough. So again, I know it&#39;s doable, but due to the more complex architecture being required, not a simple as it was in Rust. So the Rust service was just running in production, being brought up mainly on occassions when there was a need to expand it, but without a team it was always ending up either abandoning new features or working around the fact that Rust service is unmaintained.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drogus"> /u/drogus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kp74t2/rust_success_story_that_killed_rust_usage_in_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kp74t2/rust_success_story_that_killed_rust_usage_in_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>
