            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So the industry is struggling and indies are too.</p> <p>It has never been easier to make a game.</p> <p>While we have wonderful engines taking care of the rendering for us. And so many tutorials and courses.</p> <p>The gap to fill from having an idea to executing it is still huge.</p> <p>One part of it that many overlook is that making a game isn&#39;t just a matter of coding but mostly of asset creation.</p> <p>And so I want to do my part and fill that gap. I am looking forward to create AAA looking assets and to put them out for free, open source, for everyone to use.</p> <p>To help as many as possible and as much as possible, I need to figure out what you guys need. It needs to be common/foundational so that most people can use it and/or build upon.</p> <p>I actually already started and made a high quality male basemesh sculpt and was planning doing the same for female.</p> <p>After that I was planning to do basemeshes for the most common animals and monsters and release em for free. Also make their retopo, rig, shape keys and start their anim and clothing/armor/saddles libraries.</p> <p>Then, same thing for worldbuilding (landscape chunks, modular building pieces, modular materials, props, etc.)</p> <p>And then, some free plug and play data driven gameplay scripts I could give on FAB (ex. inventory + pick up system, souls like combat system, etc.) all using these base foundational assets I&#39;d make.</p> <p>All leading up to free game templates people could derive off of. Like a free souls like game template including foundational gameplay scripts and foundational assets.</p> <p>With then tutorials on how to add/modify stuff for them (just teaching blender and blueprints basically).</p> <p>So that one day it can reach a point where people only have think about the story and game progression only using libraries of free code and assets i&#39;d make (and other too since it&#39;ll all be open source). PROGRESS!!!</p> <p>But for me to do a good job, I need to be able to know what it is that you guys need. I have my fair share of game projects I made so I already have a pretty good idea.</p> <p>But I want to be as inclusive as possible. I want to cook and serve for as many people as I can.</p> <p>So I&#39;d love to hear about what you guys need.</p> <p>Ideally I&#39;d need generic and foundational assets and/or scripts but you guys can give me specific things too I&#39;ll just regroup them into their most basic form that can be derived and modified.</p> <p>I&#39;ll try to produce something like one AAA asset per week. Maybe more well see how much I can optimize my life/time to output more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight_Season_4500"> /u/Slight_Season_4500 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndwvdj/helping_game_devs_by_making_free_open_source_high/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndwvdj/helping_game_devs_by_making_free_open_source_high/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m starting out on planning a game idea I&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve begun getting familiar with Unreal Engine 5. Basically, I&#39;m not super concerned with any financial success at this point because I just want to make a game I personally want to play (because the exact game I want to play doesn&#39;t exist).</p> <p>If anyone has played Kenshi (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/</a>), its a huge inspiration for the kind of game I want to make. I have a lot of experience in statistics, math, and some decent coding/language practice (two STEM degrees), but I really just want to buy assets for a lot of the basic components at this stage. I feel like it makes sense to buy assets for systems which would take me longer to make myself, and then wouldn&#39;t be as good as what&#39;s already available.</p> <p>I can&#39;t seem to find quite the right mix of assets in the store for Unreal Engine 5. Does anyone understand what kind of character control/perspective I am looking for? Is there a term for this? I am trying to look through RTS assets for sale, maybe ARPG templates, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m finding the right thing. I don&#39;t think UE5&#39;s built in top down package is what I&#39;m looking for, and if I should just be either using their third person or top down package as a basis. Curious if anyone has any advice, because the type of game I want to make is sort of built like a combination between an RTS and RPG, where you can swap between multiple player controlled characters (who then continue with whatever tasks/orders they have when you swap off them).</p> <p>Not sure if this is even the right forum for this type of question. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: I&#39;ve made some demo games in Gamemaker Studio, I have a good grasp of computer/coding logic and node systems (amazing this stuff exists nowadays). I am asking for any tutorials specifically for what I am describing, or purchasable assets.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lamarcuss"> /u/Lamarcuss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndupvn/need_advice_on_a_top_downrts_perspective_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndupvn/need_advice_on_a_top_downrts_perspective_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Balatro-inspired roguelite game.</p> <p>I feel like I&#39;m finally in a place where I could soon send my game out for people to test it. But that&#39;s only mechanics wise, I have two more difficulty settings to fully test, but none of the art for the game is done. Enemies and towers are still just regular circles with small animations upon firing. </p> <p>I feel like I should put it out there sooner rather than later to get as much feedback on the core game loop as I can. But I&#39;m just worried the barebones art (or lack thereof) will turn people off from even playing it. </p> <p>But maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I wanna buy a new laptop and I plan to make apps and games for Android and iOS. My current laptop is a low budget windows (i7 8550u, 12GB RAM, Geforce MX130 with 2GB Video RAM + 500 Samsung SSD), its battery life is bad and it&#39;s not very portable due to its fragile frame, my main reason for considering a Macbook is its portability and battery life. I&#39;m again on a budget (lol as I was when I was buying my current laptop), I can buy a Macbook Air M3 or M4 with 16 or 24 GB RAM AND 500 GB SSD, or an Macbook Pro M2 or M3 with 16 GB RAM AND 500 GB SSD. The Macbook Air I can buy is newer with better specs but as you know Macbook Air doesn&#39;t have a fan and I doubt if it can sustain game development for like 8 hours a day, so I wanted to ask if you guys know which one is more suitable for making Android and iOS apps or medium sized games (like a 2 GB game for android). I know Macbook Air is newer with better specs, but its fanless, but you know they say because it&#39;s ARM, it doesn&#39;t get that hot, so I want to know if anyone has a heavy game development with Macbook Air. It&#39;s my first time buying a Macbook and I don&#39;t know much about it.</p> <p>P.S.: Sorry if I made some stupid mistakes or talking too much like rookies, because I am a rookie lol, I&#39;m just getting into this world and I don&#39;t know much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FleshyPete"> /u/FleshyPete </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndqqt1/is_macbook_air_good_for_making_games_for_ios_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ndqqt1/is_macbook_air_good_for_making_games_for_ios_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to share a compute shader implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwahara_filter">Kuwahara filter</a> for videos/images with Rust + WGSL. However, I created this example primarily to demonstrate how you can write a complex multi-pass shader :-) . I built using c<a href="https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/tree/main">uneus</a> (a shader engine, built with wgpu).</p> <p>The interesting part is the builder API that handles all the complex GPU binding boilerplate. Instead of manually tracking bind groups and layouts, you just chain what you need:</p> <pre><code>```rust ComputeShader::builder() .with_multi_pass(&amp;passes) // struct tensor calc, tensor field, smoothing, anisotropic filt and main entries in the wgsl side. we can ping pong them also! .with_custom_uniforms::&lt;KuwaharaParams&gt;() //egui thingies .with_channels(1) // for video/image input .build() ``` </code></pre> <p>cuneus automatically sets up the correct binding layout following WebGPU&#39;s 4-group convention. I&#39;ve been designing the architecture of this in my head for quite some time, and I think it&#39;s now in its final form for multi pass complex shaders. video/webcam supports based on the gstreamer. I pass the video/audio/webcam to the GPU in the back. Each feature you add gets its predictable slot, so the WGSL side always knows where to find things. Hot reload works out of the box so you can tweak shaders live.</p> <p>code:<br/> <a href="https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/blob/main/examples/kuwahara.rs">https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/blob/main/examples/kuwahara.rs</a></p> <p>Note, you can also download the app directly here: (search as kuwahara, but I do not guarantee stability releated with the gstreamer: but should work on windows + macs correctly) </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/releases/tag/v0.4.1">https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/releases/tag/v0.4.1</a></p> <p>See usage if you want to try more:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/blob/main/usage.md">https://github.com/altunenes/cuneus/blob/main/usage.md</a></p> <p>I&#39;m constantly improving it because I use it regularly as a hobby myself. :-) hope you enjoy</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rumil23"> /u/rumil23 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/r7m458y73fof1.gif">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndtaxi/media_kuwahara_filter_running_with_rust_wgsl/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Currently it uses multiple threads for the processing, but has sadly no gpu-support at the moment. It was created for experimenting, because I love programming, to improve my skills as software developer and to use it in job applications in the near future. It is still a PoC, but successfully tested on small tasks like for example the MNIST handwritten letters test, where it was able to reach up to 97,7 percent accuracy in the test. Beside this, it is not suitable for binary input, but works quite well so far with measurement data. In the most recent tests, I was able feed raw hourly temperature data of over a year (so in total about 10000 values) into the network, which were after the training nearly perfectly reconstructed by the network. So as next step I want to create a weather forecast for my city with the help of this project, by using huge amount of weather data from the whole region and history. This could be a good demonstrator in the end and it will help me to find and fix problems and limitations of the project.</p> <p>It was originally written in C++, but within the last 5 month I refactored the C++ code entirely into Rust as my first ever Rust project, to learn the language and to make the project more stable and secure. For comparison:</p> <p>Before (version v0.7.0):</p> <pre><code>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Language Files Lines Blank Comment Code -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- C++ 251 42826 5692 13508 23626 C/C++ Header 267 20491 3142 6692 10657 ... </code></pre> <p>After (version v0.9.0):</p> <pre><code>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Language Files Lines Blank Comment Code -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rust 104 16291 2254 1963 12074 ... </code></pre> <p>I know, it can not really be compared like this, because there are various reasons, why there is less code in Rust than in C++ at nearly the same functionality, but it should provide a basic impression of the amount of work put into it. And yes, I written it by myself and not by AI. At the beginning I used LLM&#39;s as support while debugging for example to get faster into Rust-coding, but because I wanted to learn the language and because I want always fully understand each line of my code for security reasons and because I had to change many aspects of the original architecture for the translation into Rust, it was important and necessary to write the code by myself.</p> <p>Version v0.8.0 was a hybrid with API and database-connection in Rust, but the core functions still in C++, both glued together by autocxx. Worked quite well, but had some disadvantages, which bothered me enough to refactor the rest of the code too.</p> <p>The currently open issues in the repo are only a fraction of the stuff I want to implement, test and improve. Currently I&#39;m working on the mentioned weather forecast as demonstrator, create a new dashboard with Vue.js and Typescript also for better visualization and analysis of internal workflows and I&#39;m about to split the code into a microservice architecture. So maybe a bit too much for the limited amount of time I have beside my full time job...</p> <p>Even it is still a PoC and will take some time, until a general useful version, now, after the big refactoring into Rust, at least I wanted to generate a bit more visibility for the project. I&#39;m also always happy about any feedback in the comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kitsudaiki"> /u/Kitsudaiki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndsaee/refactored_my_spare_time_cproject_into_rust_as_my/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndsaee/refactored_my_spare_time_cproject_into_rust_as_my/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It&#39;s not the fact I don&#39;t get segfaults, it&#39;s the fact the language feels good to write in. The features, the documentation, the ecosystem. It&#39;s just all so nice.<br/> In OSDev, the borrow checker is of diminished importance, but being able to craft my APIs and be sure that, unless my code logic is wrong, no small little annoying bugs that take weeks to debug pop up. You compile, it works. And if I need to do raw pointers, I still can. Because yeah, sometimes you have to, but only when absolutely necessary. And the error handling is supreme.<br/> In game dev, I&#39;m using Bevy. Simple, intuitive, just makes sense. The event loop makes sense, the function signatures are so damn intuitive and good, the entity handling is perfect. I just love it. It encompasses everything I love about programming on the desktop.<br/> In CLI tools, I am writing a PGP Telegram client. So i started making a very simple cli tool with grammers and tokio. I love tokio. It works so well. It&#39;s so perfect. I genuinely love tokio. I will never go back to pthreads again in my life. And grammers too, such a well documented and intuitive library.<br/> So, all good, right?<br/> Well, I wanted to expand this CLI tool as a GUI application.<br/> Worst mistake of my life. Or maybe second worst, after choosing my framework.<br/> Since I have experience in web dev, I choose Dioxus.<br/> I never, mean never, had so much trouble to understand something in a language. Not even when I first started using the borrow checker I was this dumbfounded.<br/> So, I wanted to use Bevy, but grammers is async. Instead of doing Bevy on the front and grammers on the back, I wanted a GUI framework that could be compatible with the event/async framework. So far so good.<br/> Dioxus was recommended, so I tried it. At first, it seemed intuitive and simple, like everything else I have done in this language. But then, oh boy. I had never that much trouble implementing a state for the program. All that intuitive mess for signals, futures and events. The JavaScript poison in my favourite language.<br/> Why is it that most of the &quot;best&quot; Rust GUI frameworks don&#39;t follow the language&#39;s philosophy and instead work around JS and React? And that leaves me to use QT bindings, which are awkward in my opinion.<br/> So, in the end, I still have not found a web-compatible good GUI framework for Rust. egui is good for simple desktop apps, but what I&#39;m trying to make should be fully cross platform.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedAxeWriter"> /u/RedAxeWriter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndevnm/most_rust_gui_frameworks_suck/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndevnm/most_rust_gui_frameworks_suck/">[comments]</a></span></div>

While I absolutely love using Rust for embedded systems, I always found the initial setup process‚Äîjuggling toolchains, targets, different flash tools, and platform-specific issues (especially on Windows)‚Äîto be a real headache.</p> <p>So, I decided to build something to fix that: <strong>Rust Embedded IDE</strong>, a VS Code extension designed to handle all the boring setup and let you focus on what matters: your code.</p> <p>My goal was to create a &quot;one-click&quot; experience, especially for popular boards like the Raspberry Pi Pico and the ESP32-C3.</p> <h1>‚ú® Key Features:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>One-Click Project Setup:</strong> Creates a new project from a pre-configured template for the Pico or ESP32-C3, with all the <code>cargo.toml</code> and memory layout files ready to go.</li> <li><strong>Automatic Environment Configuration:</strong> A single button installs all the necessary Rust targets (<code>thumbv6m-none-eabi</code>, <code>riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf</code>) and flashing tools (<code>probe-rs</code>, <code>espflash</code>, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Simple GUI for Build &amp; Flash:</strong> No more memorizing long terminal commands. Just click the &quot;Compile&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot; buttons in the sidebar.</li> <li><strong>Cross-Platform Backend:</strong> It uses a Python backend to handle all the logic, which makes it much more reliable across Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li> <li><strong>Smart Flashing:</strong> For the Pico, it automatically detects if the board is in BOOTSEL mode and can even fall back to a custom UF2 converter if the standard tools fail.</li> </ul> <p>Here‚Äôs a quick look at the UI in action:</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/p833802mxbof1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b574dfcc6038e129b4d7a5854eb7d7b114fdec12">https://preview.redd.it/p833802mxbof1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b574dfcc6038e129b4d7a5854eb7d7b114fdec12</a></p> <p>The project is still in its early stages, and I would absolutely love to get your feedback.I&#39;ve been working on this project by myself, and I&#39;m sure there are plenty of bugs and things to improve.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The embedded ecosystem in Rust always seemed quite interesting, especially the mix with async in Embassy. So when I manage to get a brand new transceiver I thought it would be a cool project to write driver for it and experiment with embassy to test the driver on a real platform.<br/> The result is a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/lr2021">new crate</a> for the LR2021 driver (a dual band transceiver, oriented toward IoT with support for BLE, LoRa, ZWave, Zigbee, ...) and <a href="https://github.com/TheClams/lr2021-apps">a repo</a> with some small demo/applications on a Nucleo board to experiment with embassy and test the driver using different protocols.<br/> I wrote some small <a href="https://theclams.github.io/">blog post </a>to keep track of my progress using embassy and the process of writing a driver: nothing ground-breaking, this is more directed to beginners, like me ;)<br/> Overall I was really impressed by the whole embedded eco-system in Rust: the traits to describe different device implementation like UART, SPI, GPIO, ... make it very easy to start developing a new application and it looks like all the main constructors are supported. And tools like probe-rs, well integrated inside cargo is absolutely fantastic. Basically everything worked right out of the box for me, the experience in embedded Rust does not feel very different from normal Rust. And when I compare to classic C environment, it is just night and day.<br/> I have not tested other embedded framework like rtic or tock, but the experience with embassy was really nice and natural: a main loop waiting on events and task running to handle leds/button/uart, everything stayed very simple. </p> <p>Hopefully this post will encourage more people to try Rust in an embedded setup. The driver itself is very niche (the chip won&#39;t be commercially available before at least next month from my understanding) but if you end up playing with it don&#39;t hesitate to contact me, even just to tell me what you built ;) On my side I&#39;ll continue working on it: next app will be an OOK TX/RX compatible to control a Somfy roller-shutter. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Clamsax"> /u/Clamsax </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndb4rz/driver_for_the_lr2021_transceiver_first/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ndb4rz/driver_for_the_lr2021_transceiver_first/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I just wanted to give you a quick update about the project and give a big thank you to the community here.</p> <p>A couple of months ago I posted a note here asking for help migrating our cluster agent from Go to Rust and we got a tremendous response. From that post, we got several new contributors including two in particular who took a lead on the project and implemented a tonic-based gRPC server that performs low level file operations inside the cluster (e.g. real-time log event monitoring and grep). Now I&#39;m happy to say that we have a release candidate with their new Rust-based cluster agent!</p> <p>The source code is here:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail">https://github.com/kubetail-org/kubetail</a></p> <p>And you can try it out live here:</p> <p><a href="https://www.kubetail.com/demo">https://www.kubetail.com/demo</a></p> <p>With the new Rust-based cluster agent we&#39;ve seen memory usage per instance drop from ~10MB to ~3MB and CPU usage is still low at ~0.1% (on the demo site). This is important going forward because the agent runs on every node in a cluster so we want it to be as performant and lightweight as possible.</p> <p>I want to give a special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/gikaragia">gikaragia</a> and <a href="https://github.com/freexploit">freexploit</a> without whose time, effort and care this wouldn&#39;t have been possible.

I also read that exporting as c-shared (DLL) works around this by making sure that the runtime is properly initialized before any call. So I tried this model, and it seemed to work. I couldn&#39;t find a way to do the same in c-archive mode, though.</p> <p>Before going further, my question is: does this mean that static linkage (c-archive) is not an option on Windows, or am I just on the wrong track?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/keeshux"> /u/keeshux </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ndm2lx/cgo_and_deadlock_on_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ndm2lx/cgo_and_deadlock_on_windows/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;ve just released version v0.5.0 of <a href="https://github.com/mlange-42/ark">Ark</a> ‚Äî an Entity Component System (ECS) library for Go that is designed for performance and simplicity.</p> <p>If you&#39;re new to Ark: it&#39;s a minimal ECS library focused on performance and simplicity, with a clean API and zero dependencies. Beyond its core ECS functionality, Ark stands out for ultra-fast batch operations and first-class support for entity relationships.</p> <p>The newly released v0.5.0 brings a mix of performance improvements, usability upgrades, and documentation enhancements. Queries are now faster thanks to smarter indexing, and new methods make it easier to sample random entities. The documentation has been expanded with a new chapter on design philosophy and limitations. You‚Äôll also find new stand-alone examples covering advanced topics like entity relations, world locking, spatial indexing, and parallel simulations.</p> <p>For a list of all changes and improvements, see the <a href="https://github.com/mlange-42/ark/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p> <p>If you&#39;re looking for a Go ECS that delivers performance without sacrificing usability, give Ark a try. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, questions, or feedback. Contributions are always welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mlange-42"> /u/mlange-42 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ndfk5f/ark_v050_released_a_minimal_highperformance/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ndfk5f/ark_v050_released_a_minimal_highperformance/">[comments]</a></span></div>
