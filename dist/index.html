I&#39;ve had people tell me it&#39;s fun, and when we&#39;ve played it&#39;s been for a long while so I take it as true. But I need to convince people to download this.</p> <p>The game&#39;s core mechanic is throwing your weapon when it&#39;s out, so the game loop is find a weapon -&gt; fight other players -&gt; take theirs -&gt; rinse and repeat. Weapons are dispensed from vending machines around the map that you either kick or throw weapons at to get them to dispense. You can kick people for melee and knock them around/juggle them, there&#39;s a lot of movement tech I&#39;ve added to ensure the bits between having a weapon are still fun, but I really want to make sure this idea sounds appealing. Which I should&#39;ve done earlier but I really didn&#39;t think I&#39;d get this far.</p> <p>What do I do?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a beginner dev, this advice is very discouraging. Most of this advice is followed with “make small games first,” “learn fundamentals,” and “participate in game jams,” which is true indeed. But the problem is, people who solely follow this advice and develop games that aren’t part of their creative vision will face motivation issues as well as imposter syndrome.</p> <p>On the other hand, this advice is also necessary. Some devs have a very broad idea and vision, they want to make their dream open-world, full-fledged MMORPG. But because they haven’t developed enough and gained experience, they will be quick to quit the project.</p> <p>Personally, I think people should create their dream game as soon as possible, but also learn the fundamentals along the way. Learn from the mistakes you make while developing your dream game, and analyze them. Participate in game jam, develop a small game and implement what you did into your dream game. </p> <p>But.. dont ignore your dream game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rwfine"> /u/rwfine </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0vddv/dont_start_with_your_dream_game_is_both_bad_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0vddv/dont_start_with_your_dream_game_is_both_bad_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Or is there a better way to implement this effect directly in a game engine?</p> <p>Any guidance or references would be greatly appreciated.

I just don&#39;t really know how well I&#39;ll be able to save/export these drawings.</p> <p>Does anybody have any experience with creating game art on a Switch?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Forever_DreamingRed"> /u/Forever_DreamingRed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0u5g4/feasibility_of_making_textures_on_a_switch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0u5g4/feasibility_of_making_textures_on_a_switch/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The results are in.</p> <p><strong>Quick Recap</strong></p> <ul> <li>Chess roguelite (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3609980/Yes_My_Queen/">Steam</a>)</li> <li>Developed in 9 months by 2 people + few freelancers</li> <li>Launched with 12k wishlists</li> <li>Priced at $12.99</li> <li>6000 EUR budget (about half of which was Reddit ads)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Results</strong></p> <ul> <li>$6000 gross revenue in the first week (616 units sold)</li> <li>~41% of revenue came on the first day</li> <li>19 qualified reviews (so non-free copies) with a rating of 94%</li> <li>11.5% refund rate</li> <li>426 wishlists converted (so ~3.5%)</li> <li>13795 remaining wishlists post-launch</li> </ul> <h1>My Impressions</h1> <p>So, what do I think of it?</p> <ul> <li><strong>Emotionally -</strong> hell yeah, we made a game that people play and enjoy!</li> <li><strong>Financially</strong> - below expectations (for the first week). If we were doing this full time (we weren&#39;t), it would&#39;ve been deeply concerning. That said, I think it is still projected to recoup the costs and then possibly still bring some profit (more on that later).</li> </ul> <p>Would I <em>recommend</em> anyone going through the same? Damn no. It makes no sense financially and it takes <em>a lot</em> from you in so many ways (time, energy, stress, money, missed opportunities). You have to be a workaholic maso with a crazy passion for games, or art, or music for it to make any sense.</p> <p>Will we do it again? Yes.</p> <h1>Hypotheses</h1> <p>This is <strong>not an advice</strong> but rather things that we did, what we observed and what we concluded. If we knew the right answers at this point we would be rolling in cash (we don&#39;t), but I have a <em>hunch</em> that some of these factors contributed one way or another and can improve our prospects.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis. Reddit Ads work, but we could&#39;ve saved some $$$</strong></p> <p>As stated in the summary, we spent a hefty sum (~$3500) on Reddit ads and they brought a lot of wishlists (~5k) at a cost of about $0.6 per wishlist (though that price suddenly spiked up in September for whataever reason and we had to stop). Overall, the ads were running for 6 months.</p> <p>Our goal here wasn&#39;t <em>exactly</em> to convert money -&gt; to wishlists -&gt; to more money. The goal was to beat our way into the Popular Upcoming section closer to the release day for which one needs 7k+ wishlists (not a confirmed number).</p> <p>Fast forward to the release date:</p> <ul> <li>We <strong>did</strong> hit the Popular Upcoming (actually we knew that a few months in advance, you can browse this section on Steam).</li> <li>That brought us about <strong>~2.1k wishlists in just a few days</strong> before the launch.</li> <li>Wishlists continued to pour in <strong>after</strong> the release. During the release week we got <strong>~1.5k more wishlists</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>All the while I have a lingering suspicion that paid wishlists did&#39;t convert to sales all that well (though I don&#39;t think there is a way to prove it).</p> <p>That leads me to this hypothesis - we shoud&#39;ve pulled the plug on paid ads as soon as we knew that we made it into the Popular Upcoming. Maybe this could&#39;ve saved us ~$1k or so.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis. The price is too steep.</strong></p> <p>The game is priced at $12.99 which some people might too expensive (in fact, our only negative review states that explicitly). I believe there are some signals that support this hypothesis:</p> <ul> <li>Wishlist conversion of 3.5% is at the low end.</li> <li><strong>A lot</strong> of wishlist additions post launch. People waiting on sale?</li> <li>The negative review and reactions on it.</li> </ul> <p>I think, we should&#39;ve priced the game at $9.99 - just below $10 mark. That said, I do think the price is fair overall and indies are undercharging. There is no way I would price our game at $5 before discounts.</p> <p>I guess we will see whether that is true after we run our first sale.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis. AI is bad for you.</strong></p> <p>Well, this one is more of a fact. <strong>Our game shipped without AI assets</strong> but we did make a huge mistake of using them in our early screenshots. I guess we just didn&#39;t know yet just how badly AI is hated (though probably should&#39;ve guessed).</p> <p>Your average player might indeed not care that much (regardless of what you personally think) as evident by a huge number of AI slop that made it into New &amp; Trending or Popular Upcoming. <em>That said,</em> it is a survivor bias.</p> <p>Here is where AI objectively will do you harm:</p> <ul> <li>Press won&#39;t feature you</li> <li>Other game devs won&#39;t bundle with you</li> <li>Game fests don&#39;t want to see you</li> <li>Anti-AI zealots will actively try to denounce you. Under your Reddit posts, under your Reddit ads, under your Steam Discussions, etc.</li> </ul> <p>Put it simply - don&#39;t use AI for anything public. Keep it for your internal prototypes if needed but people don&#39;t need to see it.</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis. Bundles are good.</strong></p> <p>We received a few offers to collab from other chess-like devs (big and small) and I think overall it has been a good experience and it did bring some sales. We sold 81 bundles in the first week.</p> <p>I am guessing that probably at this point it helped other devs more than us (since we are the ones who got a brief frontpage visibility), but it cost us nothing and I believe it will keep bringing in some sales.</p> <p>Do bundles. Bundles are good.</p> <p>That&#39;s it for now. AMA in the comments.</p> <p>If there is enough interest, I will do another check-in after the first month to share if anything have changed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gitpullorigin"> /u/gitpullorigin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0iv52/results_after_1_week_since_publishing_the_game_6k/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1p0iv52/results_after_1_week_since_publishing_the_game_6k/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Before, this was awkward; now, it&#39;s trivial.</p> <h2>The Solution</h2> <p>Use the new syntax: <code>[&lt; $id:replace(&quot;old&quot;, &quot;new&quot;) &gt;]</code></p> <p>```rust use pastey::paste;</p> <p>macro_rules! m { ($($command:ident),+) =&gt; { paste! { $(pub struct $command {})*</p> <pre><code> pub enum Command { // Takes CommandFoo and makes it Foo $( [&lt; $command:replace(&quot;Command&quot;, &quot;&quot;) &gt;] ( $command ) ),* } } } </code></pre> <p>}</p> <p>m! { CommandFoo, CommandBar }</p> <p>// Resulting usage: Clean names! let bar = Command::Bar(CommandBar {}); let foo = Command::Foo(CommandFoo {}); ```</p> <p>Upgrade to v0.2.0 and simplify your macro-generated boilerplate!</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/pastey">crates.io</a>: <code>pastey = &quot;0.2.0&quot;</code></li> <li>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/as1100k/pastey">https://github.com/as1100k/pastey</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/as1100k"> /u/as1100k </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0tex8/announcing_pastey_v020_introducing_the_powerful/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0tex8/announcing_pastey_v020_introducing_the_powerful/">[comments]</a></span></div>

What about security updates? What about certbot updates?

Any help is appreciated!</p> <p>Note that it&#39;s a hobby project, so losing existing connections after dependency updates or a cert update is acceptable (load balancer would be an overkill), but I also don&#39;t want to have too much of it - it&#39;s more than a toy I play with, it will have some users.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/unaligned_access"> /u/unaligned_access </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0opvm/axum_help_with_the_basics_of_deployment/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0opvm/axum_help_with_the_basics_of_deployment/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The framework allows you to run sandboxed applets compiled to WebAssembly, making it easier to build secure and portable firmware for microcontrollers and IoT hardware.</p> <p>What may be interesting to this group is that Rust is the primary language for writing these applets, and the toolchain makes it super simple to compile Rust to WebAssembly for the Wasefire platform.</p> <p>It&#39;s still an experimental project, but it looks promising and it&#39;s great to see another big project betting on Rust for embedded systems. The project is open source under Apache-2.0, and they are welcoming contributions. What do you all think?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been learning <strong>Rust</strong> for about <strong>3 weeks</strong> and wanted to understand how storage engines actually work under the hood. </p> <p>So <strong>I built a minimal key-value store</strong> with the core primitives I kept reading about.</p> <p>What&#39;s implemented:</p> <pre><code>• Segmented append-only log (writes go to active segment, rotates when full) • In-memory HashMap index (key → segment\_id, offset, length) • CRC32 checksums on every record • Manual compact command that rewrites live keys and removes old segments • Simple REPL with set/get/delete/compact commands </code></pre> <p>My main questions:</p> <pre><code>1/ Am I doing anything &quot;un-Rusty&quot;? I want to learn idiomatic patterns early before bad habits stick. 2/ Error handling: I&#39;m using Result everywhere but not sure if I&#39;m propagating errors the right way or if there&#39;s a cleaner approach. 3/ The compaction logic feels messy – I&#39;m iterating through segments, writing to a new file, then atomically swapping. Is there a more elegant way to structure this? 4/ File I/O patterns: I&#39;m using BufReader/BufWriter and calling sync\_all() after writes. Am I doing this efficiently or shooting myself in the foot? </code></pre> <p>Why this project: I wanted something concrete to learn from, not just syntax. Building this taught me more about ownership, lifetimes, and error handling than any tutorial could. </p> <p>Plus now I actually understand what &quot;LSM tree&quot; and &quot;compaction&quot; mean in practice.</p> <p>What surprised me:</p> <pre><code>• How naturally Rust&#39;s ownership model maps to this kind of stateful system • That compaction is genuinely complex even in the &quot;simple&quot; case • How satisfying it is to see cargo clippy teach you better patterns </code></pre> <p>I&#39;d love to know what more experienced Rustaceans would refactor or redesign.</p> <p>Any brutal honesty appreciated! 🦀</p> <p><strong>Here is the repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/whispem/mini-kvstore-v2"><strong>https://github.com/whispem/mini-kvstore-v2</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Top_Force2381"> /u/Top_Force2381 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0foo8/3_weeks_into_rust_built_a_segmented_log_kv_store/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1p0foo8/3_weeks_into_rust_built_a_segmented_log_kv_store/">[comments]</a></span></div>
