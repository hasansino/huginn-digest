            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I&#39;ve spent the past 3 years coding <a href="https://easel.games">Easel</a>, a 2D game programming language where you code your multiplayer game like a singleplayer game, and the engine takes care of all the networking and synchronization automatically.</p> <p>I chose to write it in Rust because (a) I needed determinism to keep clients in sync and (b) I needed maximum runtime performance - games have to deliver frames every 16 ms so performance is key!</p> <p>Normally if you code multiplayer games in another game engine or programming language, you have to follow the &quot;rules of multiplayer&quot; - don&#39;t do anything non-deterministic, don&#39;t mutate anything you don&#39;t have authority over, etc. I bet there are a lot of talented, creative game developers who just don&#39;t have the time or patience for all of that. The trick with Easel is that it puts the multiplayer into the fabric of the programming language itself, underneath all of your code. In the hermetically-sealed multiplayer-safe world of Easel code, you can&#39;t do anything to break multiplayer. You just code as if all players are in one shared world and don&#39;t have to worry about any of the multiplayer stuff. Underneath, Easel is doing rollback netcode (including snapshotting and rolling back all your concurrent threads, which was one of the trickiest parts to figure out) but you don&#39;t have to worry about that.</p> <p>Since I was making a new programming language anyway, I also took the time to reimagine how I think a next-generation game programming language would work. It&#39;s hierarchical. It&#39;s an unusual blend of declarative and imperative. It&#39;s got static functions but dynamics types, which is unusual but I think is the right combination for games. There&#39;s lots more but it would take too long to list it all! Each one of these could be its own topic but sometimes more explanation doesn&#39;t help - if you&#39;re curious, I would love for you to try it!</p> <p>In the early days, the project was changing constantly, but now after 3 years I feel it has reached a stable enough point that I&#39;m willing to start sharing it with the world. So if you think this sounds interesting, the Editor is web-based and free so you can just go to home page and click &quot;Try it now&quot; to have a go. There is a sample project and a few suggested features you could try adding to the codebase - see if you can figure out how to do it!</p> <p>Would love to hear any feedback you might have!</p> <p><a href="https://easel.games">https://easel.games</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BSTRhino"> /u/BSTRhino </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kmuvzx/easel_code_multiplayer_games_without_having_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kmuvzx/easel_code_multiplayer_games_without_having_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Context</h1> <p>I have a series of stack-allocated variables (hereafter I will just call them _variables_) with distinct types. For example, let&#39;s call them `a: A`,`b: B`,`c: C`...</p> <p>I have a series of functions (potentially long running and CPU-bound) that I want to invoke. Each function returns nothing and takes as argument exclusively a series of immutable or mutable references to the variables; for example:</p> <p><code>rust fn compute(a: &amp;A, b: &amp;mut B) { b.update(a.value()); } </code></p> <p>I have a statically defined partial order on the functions. I am guaranteed to always have an ordering defined between two functions when both functions refer to a common variable and when at least one of them borrows the common variable mutably.</p> <p>(Albeit probably unimportant, I am also guaranteed that two functions that do not fulfill the previous criteria do not have an ordering defined between them).</p> <p>Note that, since the dependencies between functions defines a partial ordering there are no cycles, we effectively have a DAG where the functions are nodes and the edges are defined by the ordering.</p> <h1>Desiderata</h1> <p>I&#39;d like to run the functions in parallel, and I&#39;d like the parallelism to be optimal in the sense that I&#39;d like each function to start executing as soon as its predecessors are completed (and a processor is available).</p> <p>I&#39;d like the scheduling to insert the minimal possible overhead on the runtime of my process. Ideally the approach would work well in cases with many thousands of variables and functions, and the variables&#39; state could be beefy.</p> <h1>Failed attempts</h1> <p>Because of the dependency rules defined above, I am guaranteed that no function that runs in parallel will violate the borrowing rules.</p> <p>I was hoping that I could find some way to</p> <ol> <li>Spawn multiple parallel threads (one thread per function) borrowing the pertinent state from the variables.</li> <li>Await the spawned threads concurrently.</li> <li>As soon as one thread X completes, spawn its unblocked dependencies which should now be allowed to re-borrow whichever variable was borrowed by X.</li> </ol> <p>I was imagining implementing `1` by spawning multiple threads into some kind of work stealing thread-pool which would return futures associated with each thread/function.</p> <p>I was then hoping to be able to await concurrently the futures and schedule new threads at their completion.</p> <p>Unfortunately, despite a considerable amount of time spent studying the parallelism frameworks and concurrent runtimes I was not able to find a way to implement this safely, soundly, and efficiently.</p> <p>FWIW I have been reading through the std thread API (I have an understanding on why scoped spawned needs to be blocking), rayon, tokio, smol, crossbeam etc.</p> <p>Even worst, I have been reading some stuff that seems to suggest (hopefully I am misunderstanding) that what I am doing may be impossible, as I am trying to achieve borrowing, parallelism and concurrency at the same time (<a href="https://without.boats/blog/the-scoped-task-trilemma/">https://without.boats/blog/the-scoped-task-trilemma/</a>)!</p> <h1>Static borrow checking</h1> <p>I kind of lied before when I said that I am guaranteed to always have an ordering between functions when they incompatibly borrow the same variable, but I do somehow want to enforce that invariant.</p> <p>I was hoping that the borrow checking itself could be used to validate this propriety of the ordering, and I also wouldn&#39;t mind the compiler hand-holding me and making sure that the implementation of state sharing is correct.</p> <p>In other words, I would really love if the above desiderata could be achieved without using runtime borrow checking!</p> <p>Same question on rust lang: <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/optimal-parallelism-on-a-dag/129534?u=thekipplemaker">https://users.rust-lang.org/t/optimal-parallelism-on-a-dag/129534?u=thekipplemaker</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpeakerOtherwise1353"> /u/SpeakerOtherwise1353 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kmq5ni/optimal_parallelism_on_a_dag/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kmq5ni/optimal_parallelism_on_a_dag/">[comments]</a></span></div>

My idea was to go for a very low budget version of shakes and fidget, hearthstone or the leaders of civ 6. Just everything with less detail and variation sadly...</p> <p>Think of Southpark and those games I mentioned above, probly going to be something inbetween</p> <p>Characters will be mostly displayed on cards and in scenes... Imagine a blacksmith standing infront of his forge and the player given different item choices. That&#39;s realistically as far as I can go... Probly will not even give the scenes any animation. Not a 100% sure about this since I&#39;d need easily around 30-40 characters and 20+ scenes.</p> <p>If money was no concern I&#39;d probably go for something more resembling the details of Baldurs Gate 3.</p> <p>Just to give you guys an idea on the kind of work the artist would send me back.</p> <p>Now how can I ensure they are actually not just pumping out AI art? I feel like people are not happy with AI being used in games for art especially and I can agree with that sentiment. I&#39;m a hobby musician for 20+ years now and my grand uncle used to be a painter that barely managed to feed his family. Not paying artist is not cool. But how can I guarantee that the artist i pay is actually doing it themselves ? </p> <p>Currently my plan is to hire somebody on Fiverr that fits my style and has a lot of positive reviews. The idea is to do all of the character based artwork with a single person, to garantuee they are coherent and don&#39;t clash.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hiiiklaas"> /u/hiiiklaas </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmoptk/if_i_hire_an_artist_how_do_i_know_he_is_not_just/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmoptk/if_i_hire_an_artist_how_do_i_know_he_is_not_just/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,<br/> I want to share my experience <strong>LogX Games Studio Limited</strong> and <strong>warn</strong> anyone considering to work for them. </p> <p>I&#39;m a self-thought game dev who freelanced for a while now. A little more than a year ago, the now CEO and founder Razvan Matei (this is <a href="https://www.logx.studio">public info</a>) of the company hired me over <a href="/r/gameDevClassifieds">r/gameDevClassifieds</a>. For the first month as a freelancer and afterwards on full time basis. My pay was half normal wage and half Revshare - it was not a great agreement, but I was happy to work on the project anyway as it was consistent work and I trusted the owner. I got a normal work contract and a Revshare agreement that covers most legal stuff, however the company was registered at the time in Honkong, which would come to haunt me later on. I had pretty big responsibilities, I was always looking for feedback and ways to improve - <strong>yet I never got any bad feedback</strong>. </p> <p>Fast forward to last month, after raising some technical concerns with the CEO about an AI system we used, I was blatantly insulted and belittled for daring to question established structures. On the next work day, I got the message that I was <strong>fired ‚Äúfor cause‚Äù</strong> based on completely <strong>fabricated performance reasons</strong>. Reasons that don&#39;t even match a valid for cause reason. From one day to another, I was told that I would not be getting any severance, my unused vacation days, pay in lieu - <strong>nothing</strong>. On top of this, my Revshare agreement was terminated because in the year long process &quot;the <strong>name</strong> of the project changed so it doesn&#39;t apply&quot;. My percentage of earnings was explicitly described as the other half of my pay that was completely gone now. </p> <p>Normally, this would be a easy lawsuit. However, since the company is just a <strong>shell company in Honkong</strong>, this makes it virtually impossible to enforce any judgments from the EU. It‚Äôs hard not to see this setup as intentionally designed to avoid accountability and taxes, especially since most of the team, including the owners, are from the EU. Additionally, calling this <strong>Wage Theft and Exploitation</strong> is in my opinion <strong>accurate</strong> since I was denied my entitled compensation and Revshare was supposed to be the other half of my pay. </p> <p>This whole experience has been extremely disheartening. I know I should have been more careful, though I thought, with good paperwork, I would be safe. The only thing I can do, is wait until the studio release its first title in the EU market and then take legal action. </p> <p>Has anyone here dealt with something similar? I&#39;m open to advice. I‚Äôm a bit lost right now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Huge-Dumpy"> /u/Huge-Dumpy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmfwe3/a_warning_about_logx_games_studio_exploitation/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmfwe3/a_warning_about_logx_games_studio_exploitation/">[comments]</a></span></div>

From now on, if it doesn‚Äôt work in its most basic form, we‚Äôre not building it. A lot of devs (us included) treat scope like people treat car budgets ‚Äî they forget to factor in the maintenance.</p> <p>We took a simple concept ‚Äî a card game we played over Christmas ‚Äî and twisted it: 4 players, each with a saw in front of them. Lose a round, the saw gets closer. That became <em>The Barnhouse Killer</em>.</p> <p>This time, we focused entirely on the gameplay loop first. No map design, no UI, no distractions. Once that was solid, we started layering ‚Äî one barn, one map, detailed and atmospheric, built by just the two of us. No bloat, no filler.</p> <p>We kept scope under control, which meant we had time to do things right: proper menus, UI, animation polish, actual dialogue. Things that usually get cut or rushed.</p> <p>Unlike our first attempt, this time we‚Äôre able to launch a Steam page, learn how to use Steamworks, grow wishlists, and steadily build a Discord community ‚Äî all while still actively developing the game. Keeping the scope tight is what makes this possible. We&#39;re not drowning in unfinished features, so we actually have time to focus on the backend and marketing, which are just as critical as the game itself.</p> <p>Now we‚Äôre a month or two from release. It‚Äôs a small game, but it‚Äôs polished, and it feels good. We didn‚Äôt work harder ‚Äî we worked smarter.</p> <p>Happy to answer questions or chat more if anyone‚Äôs stuck in that same ‚Äúshould we start over?‚Äù headspace.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DrystormStudios"> /u/DrystormStudios </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmcda6/we_dropped_everything_and_started_again_heres/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kmcda6/we_dropped_everything_and_started_again_heres/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I stared reading the GoPL book about 2 years ago, got through it in a couple months of lunches and bus journeys, and I enjoyed it a lot. It taught me a ton, and gave me the confidence to use it for that year&#39;s AoC too. But I never did the examples or exercise because I got stuck on the lissajous animation example from the first chapter. Last year I even spent 3 weeks of evenings bashing my head against it, trying to get it work. I became desperate enough to start researching and planning to make my own gif library (way beyond my skill level), thinking that maybe the implementation from the library was broken, after googling the issue got me nowhere.</p> <p>Thanks to a fresh attempt, and bashing Ai against it instead of myself, I&#39;ve found out that I needed to create a new gif file and write the data to that file, and not just use os.Stdout or use <code>./lg &gt; output.gif</code> or whatever. But I still don&#39;t know <em>why</em>. </p> <p>Literally just adding:</p> <pre><code>file, err := os.Create(&quot;output.gif&quot;) // make a new gif if err != nil { // handle the error fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, &quot;Error creating file: %v\n&quot;, err) os.Exit(1) } defer file.Close() // close the file lissajous(file) // run the animation </code></pre> <p>If I programatically create the file then the program writes ~ 240kb and makes a working gif, but if I use the command line (copied verbatum from the book) then the output gif is only ~170kb and completely broken. I&#39;m running go 1.20.5 on Windows 10. Is it an issue with Windows, or maybe the version of go I&#39;m on? All I can think is maybe Windows stops writing to a file after 170kb, but that doesn&#39;t feel like the right answer here.</p> <p>Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cafuzzler"> /u/Cafuzzler </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kmpu7l/a_question_about_the_gopl_book_gifs_and_windows/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kmpu7l/a_question_about_the_gopl_book_gifs_and_windows/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys,</p> <p>a coworker, coming from C# background is adamant about creating services in middleware, as supposedly it&#39;s a common pattern in C# that services lifecycle is limited to request lifecycle. So, what happens is, services are created with request context passed in to the constructor and then attached to Echo context. In handlers, services can now be obtained from Echo context, after type assertion.</p> <p>I lack experience with OOP languages like Java, C# etc, so I turn to you for advice - is this pattern optimal? Imo, this adds indirection and makes the code harder to reason about. It also makes difficult to add services that are not scoped to request lifecycle, like analytics for example. I would not want to recreate connection to my timeseries db on each request. Also, I wouldn&#39;t want this connection to be global as it only concerns my analytics service.</p> <p>My alternative is to create an App/Env struct, with service container attached as a field in main() and then have handlers as methods on that struct. I would pass context etc as arguments to service methods. One critique is that it make handlers a bit more verbose, but I think that&#39;s not much of an issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Medical_Mycologist57"> /u/Medical_Mycologist57 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1km9loz/service_lifecycle_in_monolith_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1km9loz/service_lifecycle_in_monolith_app/">[comments]</a></span></div>
