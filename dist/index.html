            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, FinnGameDev here.</p> <p>I ran into a problem of not finding an easy way to download Steam reviews in bulk from Steam. So, I made this little Chrome extension for downloading them into a CSV file. The data includes review ID, sentiment (positive or negative), and the actual text for the review. I didn&#39;t include any other data yet, since I didn&#39;t need those. I&#39;m just sending this out to see if anyone has a need for this.</p> <p><strong>Installing the extension:</strong> Download the zip file and extract it. Open your Chrome browser, go to the extensions page by typing <code>chrome://extensions/</code> into the address bar of your Chrome browser. Switch the &quot;Developer mode&quot; on in the top right corner. Click the &quot;Load Unpacked&quot; button in the top left corner and select the folder you extracted the extension.</p> <p><strong>Using the extension:</strong> Go to a Steam store game page you want to download reviews from on your Chrome browser. Click on the extensions puzzle icon on the right side of your browser address bar and click on &quot;Steam Review Scraper&quot;. In the pop-up window, click &quot;Detect App ID from current tab&quot; to get the game ID, select the language of reviews you want to download, select sentiment of reviews you want to download: all reviews, positive only or negative only, maximum reviews to download and choose if you would like to be asked the location where the file is saved to. The default save location is the browser&#39;s default save location. Then simply click the &quot;Download CSV&quot; button and watch as the reviews start rolling in. After all the reviews are downloaded, you will be asked to point to a folder for the save location if you have chosen that option.</p> <p><strong>Attention:</strong> the extension is a bit finicky about alt-tabbing away or switching tabs, so just hang on tight while the reviews are downloaded and saved.</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ipHnJnML8NHGpFDjcl9AOU1nWkrvGhgy/view?usp=sharing">Extension in action</a> (screenshot)</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oxJu7qQG8oqYqD0Dq67OXWCU1iJPwy7L/view?usp=sharing">Zip file of the Chrome extension folder</a></p> <p>I don&#39;t know if you guys have any use for this, but I figured if I had a use for it, maybe someone else will too.</p> <p>I&#39;m not selling anything or trying to boost my game (yet :D). This is totally just for people to test if they need this kind of thing. I might develop this further if there&#39;s a demand for it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FinnGameDev"> /u/FinnGameDev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nxfd12/i_made_this_small_steam_review_scraper/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nxfd12/i_made_this_small_steam_review_scraper/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nx8ulc/we_got_to_10000_wishlists_in_3_months_before/" target="_blank">We got to ~10,000 wishlists in 3 months before releasing our first demo. Here‚Äôs what worked (and what didn‚Äôt)</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I wanted to share our journey with Mexican Ninja, an indie game we‚Äôre making at Madbricks, a studio with roots in Colombia and Mexico. Both our IP creator (Carlos Rincones, a movie director) and our creative director (Dario Hoyo) are Mexican, so the game‚Äôs DNA is tied to that culture with a wider Latin American team behind it.</p> <p>The game is a fast-paced beat‚Äôem up roguelike with cultural influences from both Mexico and Japan. It‚Äôs a 2.5D arcade throwback with stylized art and irreverent humor.</p> <p>We reached around <strong>10,000 wishlists</strong> in about 3 months before releasing our first demo. That demo is now live and free to play on our Steam page.</p> <p><strong>Here‚Äôs what worked for us and what didn‚Äôt:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Community (small but stronk)</strong> - Built a Discord server early. It‚Äôs not big but people are active and supportive - Feedback from there shaped features and amplified posts - Tried Bluesky and Facebook but saw almost no traction, so we (sort of) dropped them</p> <p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: 200 people who care beat 2,000 who don‚Äôt</p> <p><strong>2. Trailers (our biggest weapon)</strong> - Kept them short (under a minute) and mixed cinematic story with gameplay - Trailers gave us something to pitch to press and creators - The big break was IGN and GameTrailers featuring us, which drove about a third of all wishlists - When that happens, be ready to show up in the comments, thank people and drop your Steam link - <strong>Important</strong>: trailers only work if the product behind them is strong. Good editing helps, but people can tell right away if a game looks rough. Invest in the game first, trailers second</p> <p><strong>3. Festivals (about a third of wishlists)</strong></p> <p>We joined: - The MIX - Six One Indie - Mexican Entertainment System - Latin American Games Festival</p> <p>Together these events brought in another third of our wishlists. Steam festivals <strong>really</strong> deliver</p> <p><strong>4. Social media (slow grind, but worth it)</strong> - Twitter and Instagram worked best. We shared GIFs, memes, dev art and behind the scenes - On Steam community we post a monthly revista with art, notes, teasers, etc. - A couple of almost viral Twitter posts added around 10% of wishlists - We kept everything consistent and on brand, even replies and thank you notes</p> <p><strong>5. Ads (not worth it for us, maybe for others)</strong> - Tried Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Reddit with under $1,000 total spend - Best cost per wishlist was about $2, which was too high for us - We cut ads almost completely</p> <p>That said, ads <strong>can work</strong> for other genres like cozy sims or puzzle games. For a niche beat‚Äôem up roguelike like ours, organic worked better</p> <p><strong>6. Streamers (a small bump so far)</strong> - A few streamed our closed beta thanks to Discord invites and personal contacts - That only accounted for less than 5% of wishlists - With our new demo though, this should change. The build is stronger and easier to share, so we expect creators to become <strong>much more influential</strong>. We know how important streamers are and we‚Äôre really relying on them moving forward</p> <p><strong>7. Gamescom (publisher support)</strong> - With our publisher we showed at Gamescom (not in the indie space, so not a ton of consumer visibility) - Ran a closed playtest with about 100 players - Wishlist impact was small, but the feedback was <strong>huge</strong> and shaped later builds</p> <p><strong>8. Visuals matter</strong> - Capsule art is critical. Don‚Äôt cut corners and don‚Äôt use AI - Screenshots and GIFs should always be your best - Steam is visual first. People decide in seconds whether to wishlist</p> <p><strong>What didn‚Äôt work for us</strong> - Bluesky and Facebook had no traction - Ads were too expensive - Waiting for streamers to show up doesn‚Äôt happen unless you reach out</p> <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p> <p>If I had to sum it up: - Festivals and trailers gave us about two thirds of wishlists - Social media momentum added around 10-15% - The rest came from community, small streamer bumps and some luck</p> <p><strong>If you‚Äôre starting out my advice is:</strong> - Focus on trailers, but remember they only work if your product looks and feels good - Join festivals (all of &#39;em!) - Build a real community - Test ads only if your genre fits them - Connect with other developers, share experiences and support each other</p> <p>Our demo for Mexican Ninja is now live if you want to check it out or wishlist.</p> <p>Happy to answer any questions</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Egoistul"> /u/Egoistul </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nx8ulc/we_got_to_10000_wishlists_in_3_months_before/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nx8ulc/we_got_to_10000_wishlists_in_3_months_before/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I‚Äôve been working on a hash table implementation using hopscotch hashing. The goal of this was creating a new hash table implementation that provides a competitive alternative that carries with it different tradeoffs than existing hash table solutions. I‚Äôm excited to finally share the completed implementation.</p> <p>The design I ended up with uses a modified version of hopscotch hashing to provide worst-case constant-time guarantees for lookups and removals, and without sacrificing so much performance that these guarantees are useless. The implementation is bounded to at most 8 probes (128 key comparisons, though much less in practice) or 16 with the <code>sixteen-way</code> feature. It also allows for populating tables with much higher densities (configurable up to 92% or 97% load factor) vs the typical target of 87.5%. Provided your table is large enough this has a minimal impact on performance; although, for small tables it does cause quite a bit of overhead.</p> <p>As far as performance goes, the default configuration (8-way with a target load factor of 87.5%) <strong>it performs well vs</strong> <code>hashbrown</code> <strong>for mixed workloads</strong> with combinations of lookup/insert/remove operations. In some cases for larger tables it benchmarks faster than <code>hashbrown</code> (though tends to be slower for small tables), although the exact behavior will vary based on your application. It does particularly well at iteration and drain performance. However, this may be an artifact of my system‚Äôs hardware prefetcher. <strong>For read-only workloads,</strong> <code>hashbrown</code> <strong>is significantly better.</strong> I‚Äôve included benchmarks in the repository, and I would love to know if my results hold up on other systems! Note that I only have SIMD support for x86/x86_64 sse2 as I don‚Äôt have a system to test other architectures, so performance on other architectures will suffer.</p> <p>As far as tradeoffs go - it does come with an overhead of 2 bytes per entry vs <code>hashbrown</code>‚Äôs 1 byte per entry, and it tends to be slower on tables with &lt; 16k elements.</p> <p>The <code>HashTable</code> implementation does use <code>unsafe</code> where profiling indicated there were hot spots that would benefit from its usage. There are quite a few unit tests that exercise the full api and are run through <code>miri</code> to try to catch any issues with the code. Usage of <code>unsafe</code> is isolated to this data structure.</p> <p><strong>When you might want to use this</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>You want guaranteed worst-case behavior</li> <li>You have a mixed workload and medium or large tables</li> <li>You do a lot of iteration</li> </ul> <p><strong>Where you might not want to use this</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>You have small tables</li> <li>Your workload is predominately reads</li> <li>You want the safest, most widely used, sensible option</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/Jesterhearts/hop-hash">https://github.com/Jesterhearts/hop-hash</a></li> <li>Benchmarks: <a href="https://github.com/Jesterhearts/hop-hash/tree/main/benches">https://github.com/Jesterhearts/hop-hash/tree/main/benches</a></li> <li>Crates.io: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hop-hash">https://crates.io/crates/hop-hash</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jesterhearts"> /u/jesterhearts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nxhkxi/hophash_a_hashtable_with_worstcase_constanttime/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nxhkxi/hophash_a_hashtable_with_worstcase_constanttime/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I primarily have a Java background and strings have been something that has messed with me a lot in rust. So I&#39;ve got questions.</p> <p>First, I always end up converting string literals to owned strings, and I feel like I&#39;m doing this too much. Therefore I&#39;m trying to figure out some better solutions for this.</p> <p>One of the most common scenarios for converting literal to owned strings is needing to return a string or a vector of strings from a function. Because &amp;str won&#39;t live long enough I conver everything to Strong. However I&#39;ve been doing some reading and I THINK &amp;&#39;static str might be better.</p> <p>If I am understanding things correctly, string literals are always static, they are stored in memory for the duration of the program and are never dropped. Therefore returning &amp;&#39;static str doesn&#39;t make the memory overhead worse because I&#39;m not extending the life of the string any more than it already is.</p> <p>Converting it to an owned String, however, is actually worse (if I&#39;m understanding things) because that owned String moves from read only memory (not sure where that lives lol) to the normal heap, which is slightly less efficient to access. This is because an owned String could potentially be mutated and string sizes cannot be known at compile time, so a dynamically sized reference (Ie, heap) is necessary.</p> <p>So I should feel free to just use &amp;&#39;static str as often as I want when dealing with string literals because there is only upside, no downside. The obvious caveat is &amp;str that is derived from a dynamic owned String may not follow this rule.</p> <p>Am I on the right track here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lambda_lord_legacy"> /u/lambda_lord_legacy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nx1kdt/new_questions_about_strings/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nx1kdt/new_questions_about_strings/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Particularly, the division that I got assigned to is working on a project using Rust.</p> <p>I&#39;ve spent the first few weeks learning the codebase&#39;s architecture by reading internal diagrams (for some reason, the company lacks low-level documentation, where they explain what each struct/function does) &amp; learning Rust (I&#39;m a C++ dev btw), and I think I already get a good understanding on the codebase architecture &amp; got some basic understanding of Rust.</p> <p>The problem is, I&#39;ve been having a hard time understanding the codebase. On every crate, the entry point is usually <a href="http://lib.rs">lib.rs</a>, but on these files, they usually only declare which functions on the crate is public, so I have no idea when they got called.</p> <p>From here, what I can think up of is trying to read through the entirety of the codebase, but to be frank, I think it would take me months to do that I want to contribute as soon as possible. </p> <p>With that said, I&#39;m wondering how do you guys navigate large Rust codebases?</p> <p>TIA! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Actuator_7990"> /u/Ill_Actuator_7990 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nwxpyq/how_to_navigate_huge_rust_codebase/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nwxpyq/how_to_navigate_huge_rust_codebase/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It allows developers to traverse verbose Go test logs in their terminal. Each test is able to be expanded and collapsed to only show the logs that matter.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Collapse/expand logs per test, so you‚Äôre not overwhelmed with output</li> <li>Fuzzy search/filter tests interactively (case-insensitive)</li> <li>Vim-inspired keymaps for navigation and folding</li> <li>Press <code>?</code> in the UI to see available keymaps</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why did I build this?</strong><br/> I run Go tests from the terminal with the CLI, though I find Go‚Äôs test output can be overwhelming, especially for large test suites. I wanted a way to quickly drill into failing or interesting tests, collapse the rest, and search/filter without needing to run them from an IDE.</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br/> Just pipe your Go test output to sift:</p> <pre><code>go test ./... -v -json | sift </code></pre> <p>You‚Äôll get an interactive UI. Press <code>/</code> to start searching/filtering test names, and use vim-style keys to navigate.</p> <p><strong>Some of the UX aspects I&#39;d be keen to get ideas for:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Highlighting of the logs. <ul> <li>Currently, it allows you use up/down/j/k to highlight logs but it doesn&#39;t quite feel right</li> </ul></li> <li>Navigating between tests <ul> <li>When the test suite is quite large it can be a little annoying to navigate down to a test that you&#39;re interested in. I added the search feature, is this sufficient to quickly find a relevant test?</li> </ul></li> <li>Anything else you&#39;d be keen to see here.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Similar Projects</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/GoTestTools/gotestfmt">gotestfmt</a> - folding only seemed to be applicable when using within Github Actions (and other CI tools)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum">gotestsum</a> - has a summary but doesn&#39;t allow viewing the logs in folds</li> </ul> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tim_tatt"> /u/tim_tatt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/timtatt/sift">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1nww6zl/github_timtattsift_a_lightweight_terminal_ui_for/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>
