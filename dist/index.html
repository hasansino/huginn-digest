I do casual game dev on my own and have a small youtube channel but I have a burning passion for scoring games and film. Im not really plugged into the online scene at all and so all the work I do right now is local. So basically, I have decided to score a game of my choosing for free, no strings attached. I have the ability to do classical music, epic or ethereal, electronic of any style, metal, or folk. I play guitar well, have a full time studio drummer, and various session artists at my disposal such as the best bass player I&#39;ve ever met, and a female folk singer. I&#39;ll be picking the game based off whatever seems coolest to me but I&#39;d prefer the game to be pretty far along. I&#39;d hate to score it and have it never come out. Obviously if you have requests that fall outside the normal capacity of my studio like live orchestra or opera, ill have to negotiate local prices with you so im not actively losing money by doing it. Anyways, it sounds fun to me, and I want to pay it forward to a project I believe in. I&#39;d also like someone who would let me run wild with the composition a bit more than standard run of the mill. I specialize in eclectic extreme styles, that blend genre. Anyways I&#39;m shit at the internet and this has probably gone on too long, üôÉ.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey people, here‚Äôs my situation:</p> <p>I‚Äôm planning to pursue my master‚Äôs at Abertay University, ideally the MProf in Games Development. After reaching out to the uni for more details, I found out that the MProf doesn‚Äôt teach technical skills like using game engines or programming. It expects you to already be comfortable with C++, game engines, and able to rapidly build prototypes. </p> <p>That was a bit of a reality check for me. </p> <p>I‚Äôve got a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science &amp; Engineering, but my game dev experience is pretty minimal, mostly replicating basic 2D games in Godot during undergrad uni. My laptop at the time couldn‚Äôt run Unity or Unreal properly, so I stuck with lightweight tools. Most of my undergrad projects were in Python (focused on ML), so I‚Äôll be starting C++ and Unreal from scratch now. </p> <p>I technically meet the entry requirements (my grades are solid because my uni emphasized theory over practicals), but I‚Äôm genuinely wondering, Can I realistically get competent in C++ and Unreal by September? Abertay themselves said the MSc in Computer Games Technology might suit me better, but I‚Äôm worried it might end up like my undergrad: lots of theory, not enough real-world, hands-on skills. I want to actually build things, not just write about them.</p> <p>So I‚Äôm looking for a realistic answer here, no matter how brutal it is. Is it doable to bridge that skill gap in 3-4 months? Or would I be setting myself up for burnout or failure trying to jump into the MProf straight away?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whatshsppening"> /u/whatshsppening </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kfk18p/can_i_realistically_learn_c_unreal_in_34_months/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kfk18p/can_i_realistically_learn_c_unreal_in_34_months/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TLDR below.<br/> I got almost 1,000 wish lists in a month, which isn&#39;t exactly 4 days as I&#39;ve been seeing in other posts, but 1,000 is typically far more than what most people get when it comes to game development. Below is the charts where I did some math of where our game gained attention.</p> <p>I am a game developer who&#39;s worked non-stop for about 1.5 years on my game. I didn&#39;t really suffer from burnout because (Dragons) are my passion. I am making a Dragon Visual novel and I recently posted our steam page on X and Reddit. </p> <p>So far, the numbers are mediocre, some good, and some bad. Here&#39;s what happened after I spent a year crafting this game.</p> <p>X - X believe it or not is the most effective way to get your game out there in my opinion. It helped me gain an audience during the last year I&#39;ve had my account on there, and last year in July one of my posts blew up which got my game a ton of attention. From that post alone, about 400 or so people joined my discord community server which surrounds the community of my game. I get about 500-1k likes per post which isn&#39;t bad, and about 50-100 reposts on average. The views is where it&#39;s at on X or the impressions where I get about an average of 5-10k views and I only started posting last year. What didn&#39;t work out was the fact that earlier on I thought I would instantly jump in viewership, but this takes time. The phrase &quot;taking time&quot; is what most people don&#39;t want to hear, but it&#39;s the truth. Good things take time. Failure is an early exit. </p> <p>Reddit - Reddit is okay. I posted my game in niche forums that fit the description of my game and so far, I&#39;ve had some people interested in the game enough to wish list it. Wish lists had slowed down but I&#39;m planning on increasing our SEO and I have some streamers lined up to test our game. Reddit ads are next to worthless; I always see Reddit ads with close to no upvotes. </p> <p>Facebook - I am still testing on Facebook, and I haven&#39;t really gained too many views for this one, and the analytics tells me it&#39;s too early to tell. I just started testing forums and threads while casually promoting my game and talking about it to people who fit the same niche demographic on who might be interested on playing it. </p> <p>Discord - One of the best platforms to expand my reach to other people who love Dragons. The Dragon community is short on good games, so I figured why not make another one?<br/> My discord server was raided on January 15th by a corrupt moderator, and we had about 700+ people on there. I was calm even after I found out it was raided. Panicking solves nothing as some people would&#39;ve reacted differently in that situation. I was calm and I said to people &quot;We will come back stronger than ever,&quot;<br/> Fast forward to 45 days we get back all of our lost members. Fast forward to today and we have almost reached discovery on Discord. We get about several joins per day now, but I plan on increasing this number soon. </p> <p>People complain about working all of the time. I learned from Alex Hormozi - </p> <h1>&quot;How to beat the competition: stay alive one day longer than them.&quot;</h1> <p>and</p> <h1>&quot;If it‚Äôs hard, good. It means no one else will do it. More for you.&quot;</h1> <p>and</p> <p>&quot;People want you to lose because it helps them justify the risks they chose not to take.&quot;</p> <p>Don&#39;t envy other people. This is the common way to be unmotivated, beaten, and poor. Work. It pays off.</p> <p>I am 22 years old, starting fresh with my life, and working is a thrill. Despite what the media and other forums tell you that it doesn&#39;t, believe me it does. If my project doesn&#39;t yield enough in my opinion, I&#39;ll go right back into the business again or find another business where I could succeed in.

Add in juicy game feel and a polished soundtrack, and it makes you wanna play with no need of explanations.</li> <li><strong>You very quickly get what Tyto is about</strong>. Within the first few seconds of the trailer, you understand what kind of game it is. So even if you watch for 5 seconds, you understand the appeal: <em>It&#39;s a beautiful 2D platformer where you play a cute owlet and move by gliding.</em></li> <li><strong>Personal story</strong>. When I posted about Tyto, I told my personal story of how I quit my day job to develop my dream game. I think it resonated with a lot of people and hooked them to check out the game. </li> </ol> <p>Hope this was helpful or interesting in some way!</p> <p>If you‚Äôve done something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear how it went for you - especially if you noticed other platforms working well (or poorly). And if any of my conclusions seem off, feel free to challenge them ‚Äî I‚Äôm here to learn too.</p> <p><strong>Just a quick yet important reminder:</strong> this is all based on <strong>my</strong> experience with Tyto. What worked well for me might not work the same for <strong>your</strong> game.<br/> Every audience, genre, and presentation is different. I‚Äôm just sharing what I learned in case it‚Äôs helpful.</p> <p>Also, if you&#39;re curious to see what Tyto is all about, I&#39;ll leave a link to the Steam page in the comments.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So am a gamedev nearing my 40s with over 15 years experience. Started in this field by modding old games in my teens like diablo, dungeon siege, silverfall which i still got hosted on several mod hosting sites. I also actively mod and code Skyrim. </p> <p>Keeping that aside I have worked on several game projects over the years for different clients but only recently started to work on my own small game. </p> <p>After work and family time am usually pretty tired at the end of the day and usually spend time playing games with my friends (mostly competitive games like planet side 2, paladins, marvel rivals.)</p> <p>So yea what am trying to say is it&#39;s pretty hard to find time after all those things and with the advent of chatgpt, I&#39;ve started delegation boilerplate code to it. I am finding it really handy to generate code snippets or functions and only thing I have to do is verify it before implementing. It&#39;s like having my own junior developer who has vaste knowledge and does what I ask of him abit wonky sometimes, fumbles a lot and gives crappy unwanted unasked suggestions in the name of improvements but that&#39;s why I read and verify the code before implementing. Recently I find myself asking it to write more and more stuff or even modify already written functions which I can easily do myself like replacing a list with a dict and using it which are simple tasks, so sm afraid i might be getting too dependant. </p> <p>I still do the GDD, project and code architecture myself and i really enjoy doing that part than actual on hands coding. Maybe it&#39;s cause of shift in my job from a ground level on hands programmer to project architect a few years ago. </p> <p>I have been thinking about it lately and I have pinpointed the reasons to lack of time at the end of the day and begin exhausted. Maybe if I had more time and energy, even then i am finding myself just asking it to write even the simple functions like moving a character, even though I have done it myself several hundred times.</p> <p>What do you guys think? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeadlyTitan"> /u/DeadlyTitan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kfa5fh/have_i_become_lazy_by_using_chatgpt_am_scared_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kfa5fh/have_i_become_lazy_by_using_chatgpt_am_scared_i/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience after releasing my first game. </p> <p>The game is completely text-based, no graphics at all.<br/> Players start by clicking to collect stones, then gradually build automation systems, and eventually defeat a boss. </p> <p>I launched it 1.5 years ago on both Android and iOS, priced at $1.<br/> It has made about $2,700 in revenue so far, 85% from iOS, and 95% of that from Japan. </p> <p>Here‚Äôs a timeline of how it went: </p> <p>I first released it on Android. It took a week to show up on Google Play. About two weeks later, I got my first purchase, I was so excited I refreshed the Google Play Console every hour. </p> <p>I tried promoting it with Google Ads, but it was too expensive (about $50 per user). I stopped after spending $150. </p> <p>Then some comments and emails came in. I started updating the game based on user feedback and replying to messages. </p> <p>Sales started rising‚Äîpeaking at 30 copies a day. I thought I might actually get rich! But the peak only lasted a week. Then it dropped to 20/day, then 10, and eventually down to 5 per month. </p> <p>Three months later, I bought a Mac Mini and released the iOS version. I checked App Store Connect daily, but nothing sold for months. </p> <p>I figured the game had failed. I stopped checking sales dashboards regularly. Eventually, I didn‚Äôt check them at all. </p> <p>Then, just a month ago, I logged in again to prepare tax info, and saw that the Android version was still selling 5 copies/month‚Ä¶<br/> But the iOS version had sold over 3,000 copies! </p> <p>There was a huge spike last December, 1,600 copies sold in one month. Even now, it‚Äôs selling around 100 copies/month.<br/> Some people left kind reviews saying they loved the game. </p> <p>This gave me a huge boost of confidence, and now I‚Äôm working on my next game. And I‚Äôm 90% confident it‚Äôll be a big success </p> <p>By the way, the game is called Word Factory on Android, and Woord Factory on iOS (the original name was taken). The icon has ‚ÄúStone +1‚Äù on it, in case you want to check it out. </p> <p>Thanks for reading, happy to answer questions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hehhehehhehe"> /u/hehhehehhehe </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kf51t9/my_first_game_made_2700_in_15_yearsheres_the_story/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kf51t9/my_first_game_made_2700_in_15_yearsheres_the_story/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks,</p> <p>I wanted to share a Go library I&#39;ve been working on called <a href="https://github.com/epilande/go-devicons">go-devicons</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why I built it:</strong></p> <p>I initially made it because I needed consistent file/folder icons for my TUI project, <a href="https://github.com/epilande/codegrab">codegrab</a>. I noticed many CLI/TUI tools maintain their own icon mappings directly within their codebase. I thought it would be useful to extract this logic into a dedicated, reusable library that other Go projects could easily integrate, leveraging the extensive mappings available in the developer community.</p> <p><strong>What it does:</strong></p> <p>`go-devicons` provides a simple way to get a Nerd Font icon character and a suggested hex color string for a given file path or `os.FileInfo`.</p> <p>It pulls its extensive icon mappings directly from the <a href="https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons">nvim-web-devicons</a> project, covering hundreds of file types, specific filenames (like .gitignore, go.mod, Dockerfile), and more. This makes it easy to add visually informative icons to your Go terminal applications.</p> <p><strong>GitHub Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/epilande/go-devicons">https://github.com/epilande/go-devicons</a></p> <p>I hope some of you find this useful for your own Go CLI or TUI projects!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, week ago i write post from my another account where i ask you to rate my <a href="https://github.com/Ametion/Dyffi">router lib</a> in Golang, basically i just write there about my really cool (i think they really cool) features in my router, such as -</p> <ul> <li>Classic middlewares/cors/regex in path/routes grouping</li> <li>Fully worked Graphql in same router, so you can write REST routes on same router where is Graphql and start just one thing instead of 2 or something like that.</li> <li>Automatic (now already customizable too) authorization system where you just provide config for JWT/API KEY/Basic auth, and router complete all the work for you, such as logining, middleware and etc.</li> <li>Integrated functionality to work with queues such as Kafka/Rabbitmq/Nats , you can send a message to broker just from insides of handler</li> </ul> <p>Today i just fixes a lot of thinks inside my router, and now i thinks i should add better logs system before i can say that this is prod-ready product. As i say in previous post, i just added fully worked Dependency Injection (DI) system, like the new for golang, every DI lib i use before, it was so strange in dev experience for me, just some strange calls/funcs and etc. I implement DI in my router in <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> or NEST.js style. You basically provide interface in params of func, and router provide implemented struct for it, code:</p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;net/http&quot; &quot;os&quot; &quot;strconv&quot; &quot;github.com/Ametion/dyffi&quot; ) //YOUR INTERFACE type IRepository interface { GetUserByID(id int) string } type Repository struct { } func (repo *Repository) GetUserByID(id int) string { return &quot;User with id &quot; + strconv.Itoa(id) } func main() { engine := dyffi.NewDyffiEngine() //GIVING ROUTER IMPLMENTED STRUCT engine.Provide(Repository{}) //USING THIS STRUCT INSIDE HANDLER engine.Get(&quot;/test&quot;, func(context *dyffi.Context, repository IRepository) { context.SendJSON(200, repository.GetUserByID(1)) }) engine.Run(&quot;:8080&quot;) } </code></pre> <p>As you can see, here you just need to provide what functionality need to have service (by showing interface in params) and provide your implementation of it in Provide() func for engine. And that&#39;s it, you do not need to do anything else, just this, and btw it works same with Graphql resolvers.</p> <p>I will really appreciate your opinion in general about router, and even more i will appreciate reprimands, its really helping to improve my router, i hope you will like it :) here is link for <a href="https://github.com/Ametion/Dyffi">Repository</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Ametion/Dyffi/releases/tag/v0.0.8">Realese Notes</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Ametion/Dyffi">https://github.com/Ametion/Dyffi</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Flap1ks"> /u/Flap1ks </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kfm5ca/dyyfi_router_new_dependency_injection_system_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kfm5ca/dyyfi_router_new_dependency_injection_system_for/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Article from Zhihu, created by Grok!</p> <p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a> community! I&#39;ve been tinkering with a new way to handle enums in Go, and I&#39;m excited to share my open-source library, <code>tnnmigga/enum</code>, with you all. Go doesn&#39;t have a native <code>enum</code> keyword, so I came up with a creative, slightly <em>hacker</em> solution that brings some of the elegance of TypeScript/C#-style enums to Go. Let me walk you through it and see if you find it as cool as I do! üòé</p> <h1>The Traditional Go Enum Approach</h1> <p>In Go, enums are typically implemented using <code>const</code> blocks. For example, here&#39;s how HTTP status codes are often defined (like in the standard library):</p> <pre><code>package http const ( StatusContinue = 100 // RFC 9110, 15.2.1 StatusSwitchingProtocols = 101 // RFC 9110, 15.2.2 StatusProcessing = 102 // RFC 2518, 10.1 StatusEarlyHints = 103 // RFC 8297 StatusOK = 200 // RFC 9110, 15.3.1 // ... and many more ) var status = StatusOK </code></pre> <h1>Pros of the Traditional Approach</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Constants are as fast as it gets.</li> <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: No need to worry about <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, or <code>int32</code>‚Äîjust assign and pass them freely.</li> </ul> <h1>Cons</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Repetitive Prefixes</strong>: Every constant starts with something like <code>Status</code>, which gets old fast.</li> <li><strong>Namespace Pollution</strong>: A single package exports a ton of symbols, making it hard to navigate in editors without memorizing partial names to find the right enum field.</li> </ul> <p>If you&#39;ve used <strong>TypeScript or C# enums</strong>, you might wonder: </p> <pre><code>export enum HttpStatus { OK = 200, NotFound = 404, } let status = HttpStatus.OK </code></pre> <p><strong>Can Go do something like this?</strong> Of course it can!</p> <p>My library introduces a struct-based enum system that&#39;s both intuitive and powerful. Instead of a flat list of constants, you define enums as a struct, and my <a href="http://enum.New"><code>enum.New</code></a> generic function does the heavy lifting to create a usable enum object. The values can be derived from tags, field indices, or field names, depending on your needs.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a quick example:</p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;github.com/tnnmigga/enum&quot; ) var HttpStatus = enum.New[struct { OK int `enum:&quot;200&quot;` // 200 NotFound int `enum:&quot;404&quot;` // 404 }]() var HttpStatusTxt = enum.New[struct { OK string `enum:&quot;ok&quot;` // ok NotFound string // NotFound }]() func main() { fmt.Println(HttpStatus.NotFound) // 404 fmt.Println(HttpStatusTxt.NotFound) // NotFound } </code></pre> <h1>What&#39;s Happening Here?</h1> <ul> <li><a href="http://enum.New"><code>enum.New</code></a> is a generic function that returns a struct object.</li> <li>Field values are set based on: <ul> <li><strong>Tag values</strong> (e.g., <code>\</code>enum:&quot;200&quot;`<code>for</code>OK`).</li> <li><strong>Field index</strong> (if no tag is provided for numeric types).</li> <li><strong>Field name</strong> (if no tag is provided for strings).</li> </ul></li> <li>The result is a clean, dot-accessible enum like <code>HttpStatus.OK</code> or <code>HttpStatusTxt.NotFound</code>.</li> </ul> <h1>Nested Enums for Extra Organization</h1> <p>Want to group related enums together? My library supports recursive enums! Check this out:</p> <pre><code>package main import ( &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;github.com/tnnmigga/enum&quot; ) var HttpStatus = enum.New[struct { Code struct { OK int `enum:&quot;200&quot;` // 200 NotFound int `enum:&quot;404&quot;` // 404 } Txt struct { OK string `enum:&quot;ok&quot;` // ok NotFound string // NotFound } }]() func main() { fmt.Println(HttpStatus.Code.NotFound) // 404 fmt.Println(HttpStatus.Txt.NotFound) // NotFound } </code></pre> <p>This lets you organize enums hierarchically, reducing namespace clutter and making your code more intuitive.</p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <p>The magic happens through Go&#39;s reflection. When you call <a href="http://enum.New"><code>enum.New</code></a>, it inspects the struct, processes tags, and assigns values to the fields. It&#39;s a bit of a <em>hacker</em> trick, but it results in a clean API that&#39;s fun to use. While reflection adds a small overhead at initialization, the runtime performance is still excellent since you&#39;re just accessing struct fields afterward.</p> <h1>Why Use tnnmigga/enum?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Cleaner Syntax</strong>: No more repetitive prefixes like <code>Status</code>.</li> <li><strong>Organized Enums</strong>: Group related constants with nested structs.</li> <li><strong>Flexible Values</strong>: Support for both numeric and string enums, with custom values via tags.</li> <li><strong>Type Safety</strong>: Leverages Go&#39;s type system for robust code.</li> <li><strong>Editor-Friendly</strong>: Fewer exported symbols make autocompletion a breeze.</li> </ul> <h1>Try It Out!</h1> <p>Ready to give it a spin? Install the library and start experimenting:</p> <pre><code>go get github.com/tnnmigga/enum@v1.0.1 </code></pre> <p>Check out the full source code and documentation on GitHub:<br/> üîó <a href="https://github.com/tnnmigga/enum">github.com/tnnmigga/enum</a></p> <h1>Feedback Wanted!</h1> <p>I&#39;m curious to hear what you think! Is this approach useful for your projects? Any features you&#39;d like to see added? Maybe support for more complex enum patterns or additional customization? Drop your thoughts, critiques, or ideas in the comments‚ÄîI&#39;d love to make this library even better with community input.</p> <p>Thanks for checking it out, and happy coding! üõ†Ô∏è</p> <p>P.S. If you like the project, a ‚≠ê on GitHub would mean the world! üòÑ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tnnmigga"> /u/tnnmigga </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kf4ku6/introducing_tnnmiggaenum_a_hackers_approach_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kf4ku6/introducing_tnnmiggaenum_a_hackers_approach_to/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! </p> <p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/Oudwins/zog">Zog V0.20</a> which comes with quite a few long awaited features.</p> <p>I case you are not familiar, Zog is a Zod inspired schema validation library for go. Example usage looks like this:</p> <p><code>go type User struct { Name string Password string CreatedAt time.Time } var userSchema = z.Struct(z.Shape{ &quot;name&quot;: z.String().Min(3, z.Message(&quot;Name too short&quot;)).Required(), &quot;password&quot;: z.String().ContainsSpecial().ContainsUpper().Required(), &quot;createdAt&quot;: z.Time().Required(), }) // in a handler somewhere: user := User{Name: &quot;Zog&quot;, Password: &quot;Zod5f4dcc3b5&quot;, CreatedAt: time.Now()} errs := userSchema.Validate(&amp;user) </code></p> <p>Here is a summary of the stuff we have shipped:</p> <p><strong>1. Revamp internals completely &amp; in order execution</strong></p> <p>For those familiar with Zog we started with a pretransform + validation + postTransform approach. In this release while we still support all of those features we have simplified the API a lot and made it even more similar to Zod.</p> <p>Transforms replace postTransforms and run sequentially in order of definition:</p> <p>```go</p> <p>z.String().Trim().Min(1) // this trims then runs Min(1) z.String().Min(1).Trim() // this runs Min(1) then Trims ```</p> <p><strong>2. Preprocess implemented!</strong> We have implemented z.Preprocess which can we used instead of preTransforms to modify the input data and do things like type coercion.</p> <p><code>go z.Preprocess(func(data any, ctx z.ctx) (any, error) { s, ok := data.(string) if !ok { return nil, fmt.Errorf(&quot;expected string but got %T&quot;, data) } return strings.split(s, &quot;,&quot;), nil }, z.Slice(z.String()))) </code></p> <p><strong>3. Not String Schema</strong> Zog now supports Not operator for the string schema! </p> <p><code>go z.String().Not().ContainsSpecial() // verify that it does not contain special character! </code></p> <p><strong>4. z.CustomFunc() for validating custom types</strong> With z.CustomFunc you can now create quick a dirty schemas to validate custom types! Use this with z.Preprocess to even parse json or any other input into your custom type then validate it.</p> <p><code>go schema := z.CustomFunc(func(valPtr *uuid.UUID, ctx z.Ctx) bool { return (*valPtr).IsValid() }, z.Message(&quot;invalid uuid&quot;)) </code></p> <p><strong>5. Improved typesafety across the board</strong> Although Zog continues to use the empty interface a lot you will find that it now allows you to more naturally type things like z.Preprocess, transforms, tests, etc for primitive types. This is an awesome quality of life change that comes from our reworked internals.</p> <p>Now if we can figure out how to type the structs we&#39;ll be able to have this level of typesafety across the entire library!</p> <p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Oudwins/zog">https://github.com/Oudwins/zog</a> docs:<a href="https://zog.dev/">https://zog.dev/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Oudwin"> /u/Oudwin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kf4av1/zog_v0200_release_biggest_update_yet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kf4av1/zog_v0200_release_biggest_update_yet/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi Rustaceans! </p> <p>I‚Äôve been working on a Rust/Tokio-based channel implementation to handle UI and data processing with reliable backpressure and event-driven polling, and I‚Äôd love your feedback. My goal is to replace a dual bounded/unbounded mpsc channel setup with a single bounded mpsc channel, augmented by a watch channel to signal when the main channel is full, triggering polling without arbitrary intervals. After exploring several approaches (including mpsc watcher and watch with mark_unchanged), I settled on a counter-based watch channel to track try_send failures, ensuring no signals are missed, even in high-load scenarios with rapid try_send calls. </p> <p>Below is the implementation, and I‚Äôm seeking your review on its correctness, performance, and usability. Specifically, I‚Äôd like feedback on the recv method‚Äôs loop-with-select! design, the counter-based watch approach, and any potential edge cases I might have missed.</p> <p>Context</p> <ul> <li>Use Case: UI and data processing where the main channel handles messages, and a watcher signals when the channel is full, prompting the consumer to drain the channel and retry sends.</li> <li>Goals: <ul> <li>Use a single channel type (preferably bounded mpsc) to avoid unbounded channel risks.</li> <li>Eliminate arbitrary polling intervals (e.g., no periodic checks).</li> <li>Ensure reliable backpressure and signal detection for responsiveness.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>&#8203;</p> <pre><code>use tokio::sync::{mpsc, watch}; /// Error type for PushPollReceiver when the main channel is empty or closed. #[derive(Debug, PartialEq)] pub enum PushMessage&lt;T&gt; { /// Watcher channel triggered, user should poll.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have an enum <code>U</code> that is commonly used wrapped in an option.</p> <p>I will often use it converting from types I don&#39;t have defined in my crate(s), so I can&#39;t directly do the impl in the title.</p> <p>As far as I have come up with I have three options:</p> <ol> <li><p>Create a custom trait that is basically (try)from/into for my enum wrapped in an option.</p></li> <li><p>Define <code>impl From&lt;T&gt; for U</code> and then also define `impl From&lt;U&gt; for Option&lt;U&gt;.</p></li> <li><p>Make a wrapper struct that is N(Option&lt;U&gt;).</p></li> </ol> <p>I&#39;m curious what people recommend of those two options or some other method I&#39;ve not been considering. Of the three, option 3 seems least elegant.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Isodus"> /u/Isodus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kf1tlu/best_way_to_go_about_impl_fromt_for_optionu_where/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kf1tlu/best_way_to_go_about_impl_fromt_for_optionu_where/">[comments]</a></span></div>
