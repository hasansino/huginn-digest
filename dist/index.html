            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m brand new to trying out game development. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to do, and I&#39;m finally at a point in my life to figure out how to begin making a game. I have no prior knowledge of any computer programming, save taking one lesson on Khan Academy 10 years ago when I was bored, lol. I have a kit that can teach me the very basics of Python, so I plan to do that but aside from that I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and where I should start. I downloaded Unreal Engine 5 and messed around on that for a bit, but very little made sense to me just starting out, and now I&#39;m wondering if I jumped into the deep end. I know RPG Maker is a thing, and I had it on the 3DS years ago, and that didn&#39;t seem too difficult, should I look into using it on the PC to make a real game? Or is that not what it&#39;s for. I&#39;m open to any and all advice I could get, I&#39;m just really lost and not sure how to begin. My eventual goals are to make 3rd person 3D adventure games, but I also want to make 2D sprite RPGs like old school Final Fantasy. Thank you all for your responses and time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Impishly-me"> /u/Impishly-me </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qlcja5/brand_new_to_development/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qlcja5/brand_new_to_development/">[comments]</a></span></div>

After a quite a few hours of debug with ai coder help, turned out even this simple scenario required a planning in-depth of 11! and to find it with many options even on simple sim - dimensionality of space just explodes.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! It&#39;s been roughly 10 months since my game launched, and I want to share a bit about what went into making this game, what went well, what I struggled with, and what I learned along the way. But first of all, I want to thank everyone who has played, supported, or stuck around. Without you, this journey would have been much harder. </p> <p><strong>About the Game</strong></p> <p>Within the Cosmos is a single-player, first-person RPG focused on player choice, systemic gameplay, and reactive quests.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Single-player first-person RPG</li> <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 28 March 2025</li> <li><strong>Price:</strong> $14.99 USD | €14.79 | £12.79</li> <li><strong>Platform:</strong> PC (Steam)</li> <li><strong>Steam:</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/618330/Within_the_Cosmos/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/618330/Within_the_Cosmos/</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Why I Made the Game</strong></p> <p>10 years ago, I started building a game inspired by the freedom and reactivity of Deus Ex, Fallout 1 &amp; 2, and New Vegas. I didn’t know it would define nearly a decade of my life.</p> <p>This was the RPG I always wanted to play. I wanted it to be layered, reactive, full of systems you could tinker with, and choices that truly changed things. I learned a lot as I went, rebuilt systems multiple times, and refined the vision year after year.</p> <p>At the time, you couldn’t simply publish your game on Steam by paying a fee. You had to go through Steam Greenlight, where players voted for games before they could be approved for release. I was ecstatic when Within the Cosmos was approved by the community, and funnily enough (I just noticed this whilst typing this post-mortem!), the game was Greenlit almost exactly eight years before the game’s launch, on 30 March 2017.</p> <p>Over the years, the game changed and evolved as I learned and gained more experience. I had multiple offers from publishers (some were very good), but I wanted to prove, to myself more than anyone, that I could carry a project from beginning to end. I put everything I had into this: my time, money, and heart. I didn’t just make this game, I structured every bit of my life around it.</p> <p><strong>Preparing for Launch</strong></p> <p>I ran two beta tests with a small but committed group of lovely testers. They found countless issues I never would have caught alone. Without them, I think the game would have launched to very negative reviews instead of ‘Mixed’.</p> <p>However, the game still launched with a significant number of issues. Any of the bugs at launch were completely on me, not them. The game was complex, with too many systems interacting with one another for one person to fully test. It also didn’t help that I kept adding things even after the beta tests ended. I did my best at the time, but it wasn’t enough. Sometimes as the sole creator, especially after making and playing the game for so long, you tend to play the game the way it&#39;s ‘meant’ to be played and glaring issues simply don’t reveal themselves. I thought it was ready for launch, but it wasn’t.</p> <p><strong>What Went Well</strong></p> <ul> <li>Art direction: Players liked it, and I’m proud of it. Environment art was what initially got me into game development, so I’m glad I was able to express that well.</li> <li>Writing and worldbuilding: My favourite part. Dialogues, lore, and in-game books generally got a lot of praise.</li> <li>Systems and mechanics: Most people enjoyed the RPG builds. Players told me they enjoyed experimenting.</li> <li>Post-launch support: Dozens of patches, including Update 2.2, all of which fixed many launch bugs and added several features the community requested, and that I had wanted to include at launch but couldn’t.</li> <li>The ambition was recognised: Even if I fell short, people saw and appreciated the effort.</li> <li>I finished and released the game! That’s huge on its own.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What Was Mixed</strong></p> <ul> <li>Voice acting: The voice actors elevated the game, but VO ate a huge chunk of the budget. Though the writing was generally praised, I had to cut a lot of written content that was intended to be spoken by NPCs, because every extra word of spoken dialogue increased the budget.</li> <li>Dialogue options and mission outcomes: I gave as many as I could, but it was limited by VO costs. Every extra line meant more money, so I had to reduce some of the possible outcomes, and I had to use VO that can be applied across various situations.</li> <li>Reviews: Praise for concept, ambition, art, and writing, frustration with bugs and crashes. Result: Mixed rating since launch.</li> <li>Sales: After 10 months, 810 units. Enough to fund a smaller project but certainly nowhere near enough to live on.</li> <li>Wishlist overview: 30k added, 12k removed, 660 purchases from wishlisters, 17.7k still outstanding. Lifetime conversion rate: 2.2% (Steam average: 15.3%). It shows there’s still some interest, but many wishlisters haven’t converted.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What Went Poorly</strong></p> <ul> <li>Bugs &amp; Crashes: This is the obvious one. The complexity and extremely limited testing meant too many bugs slipped through.</li> <li>Old code: Early unoptimised systems created long-term limitations, which also led to bugs &amp; crashes.</li> <li>Overscope: I aimed for an open-hub RPG with full VO, this is usually made by teams of hundreds with a significantly higher budget.</li> <li>I consistently underestimated how long project objectives would take, which caused promised release dates to come and go. This one still bothers me to this day.</li> <li>Poor communication: Delays and burnout made me quieter than I should have been during development.</li> <li>No marketing: I was in dev mode right up to launch. No budget, and very little outreach. I treated marketing as something I’d do ’after the game was done.’ That was a mistake.</li> <li>Refund rate was extremely high: Mostly due to bugs and crashes (based on the most common reasons users selected for their refund on Steam). Refund rate was 30% during the first month, down to 16% in August, and 4.8% in the latest month. Total average: 14.7%, showing that retention has been improving after patches. So, things have certainly improved!</li> </ul> <p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p> <ul> <li>Test for far longer than you think you need to.</li> <li>Keep scope realistic for your team size.</li> <li>Account for how long project objectives actually take.</li> <li>Silence kills trust, so communicate even if it’s bad news.</li> <li>Prepare emotionally for launch.</li> <li>Set aside time just for marketing.</li> <li>Bugs and crashes hurt more than design flaws, so fix them first.</li> </ul> <p>The long development and repeated delays certainly made many players cautious, understandably. Combining that with a launch that had many bugs and crashes, this meant that some initial players never returned. For a solo indie dev with no marketing, the launch window is absolutely crucial, and first impressions matter more than post-launch fixes. These lessons are absolutely informing how I approach my next project. </p> <p><strong>Where the Game Stands Now</strong></p> <p>It is far more stable and polished now. It still has some jank, but it finally feels like what I set out to make. Financially, it didn’t hit my hopes, but it bought me time and experience. I’m already working on my next project, built on these lessons, approaching scope, testing, and production far more intentionally from the start.</p> <p>But I am not abandoning Within the Cosmos just yet. I will absolutely continue supporting it.</p> <p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></p> <p>It wasn’t a perfect launch, but it wasn’t careless either. I gave it everything I had. I’m still here, still improving, and still learning.</p> <p>If you are making something solo: you are not alone. Feeling overwhelmed, burned out, and struggling is normal… but finishing, even imperfectly, is meaningful. Regardless of everything that happened, I’m profoundly proud of this project, and I genuinely love my game.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who has played, supported, tested, or just believed in the project. You made the journey possible.</p> <p>I didn’t get the ending I hoped for, but I got experience, lessons, and the chance to try again. And I will.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/debdev"> /u/debdev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ql0p3u/post_mortem_9_years_building_the_rpg_i_always/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ql0p3u/post_mortem_9_years_building_the_rpg_i_always/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Steam Next Fest = momentum <strong>amplification</strong></li> <li><strong>Releasing a demo months before Next Fest</strong> consistently outperforms demo launch during fest.</li> <li>Launching your demo during Next Fest is usually a mistake unless you’ve already tested it heavily.</li> <li>The <strong>first 48 hours matter a lot</strong>. Everything is randomized early, then personalization kicks in.</li> <li>Steam does <strong>not</strong> care about demo playtime, completion rate, or session length when it comes to the algorithm favoring you during Steam Next Fest. This is due to these metrics varying wildly across genres. </li> <li>Games entering with higher wishlist counts tend to gain <strong>more wishlists during Next Fest</strong>.</li> <li>Live streams are no longer a major discovery driver. Nice to have, not critical.</li> <li><strong>Separate demo pages</strong> + positive reviews are one of the strongest readiness signals you can get before committing to Next Fest.</li> <li><strong>Update your Steam Page</strong> (localization, screenshots, gifts, steam tags, etc)</li> <li>Reach out to creators and press <strong>at least a month ahead of time</strong>, send multiple emails (no more than 3). Include early access to your Next Fest demo build. </li> <li>If your demo has been out for a while include a <strong>significant content update</strong> during Next Fest. </li> <li>Have clear funnels in your demo to wishlists as well as <strong>Discord &amp; Newsletter Signups</strong>.</li> <li>Include a way for players to report bugs and feedback <strong>in game</strong>.<br/></li> <li>Have a plan to get players coming back to play the demo throughout the week (specific ideas and case studies on this in the full article)</li> </ul> <p>In the full article I cover a ton more useful stuff.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been researching 90s development cycles for my own project, and I’ve noticed a fascinating shift. It’s not just about the tech but it’s about a mindset rooted in a specific cultural underground that seems to have vanished.</p> <p>Here are the &quot;symptoms&quot; of that era I’ve identified:</p> <ol> <li>The Demoscene as the R&amp;D department of the 90s. John Carmack frequently cited the scene as a source of inspiration, and many old studios (like Remedy) were born out of demo-groups or people who closely followed the scene (like Jesper Kyd). While &quot;hacking the hardware&quot; is less common today due to modern engines, I want to highlight the sheer originality of their approach to product design and problem-solving.</li> <li>While orchestral scores existed (<em>HoMM III</em> &quot;Stronghold&quot; theme is a masterpiece), the 90s audio space was ruled by Electronic Music. Look at <em>Half-Life, Deus Ex, UT99, System</em> <em>Shock</em>, or <em>Streets of Rage 2</em>. Even when composers like Michiel van den Bos worked on fantasy titles like <em>Age of Wonders</em>, the DNA was pure electronica. The use of specific sample packs, trance-inspired progressions (Phrygian and Dorian modes), and synths like the Roland JV-1080 wasn&#39;t just a technical limitation; it was a stylistic choice following the global rave and industrial trends. Even the <em>DOOM</em> OST follows the logic of electronic music construction despite its metal roots.</li> <li>&quot;Unhealthy&quot; Work Culture as Artistic Obsession. Today we (rightfully) prioritize Work-Life Balance. But back then, &quot;crunch&quot; was often a form of &quot;guerrilla development.&quot; Chris Avellone working 60+ hours on <em>Fallout</em>, or the Blizzard team redesigning <em>StarCraft</em> overnight after a lukewarm E3. These games are filled with &quot;inside jokes&quot; and atmospheric details that serve no &quot;gameplay logic&quot; by modern design standards but add incredible depth.</li> </ol> <p>While this might seem unfair to the modern indie scene, I feel like we are missing that specific &quot;depth.&quot; Modern indie often falls into two traps: it’s either too experimental to be a &quot;game,&quot; or it&#39;s commercial indie made using the templates of other successful indies (the endless loop of pixel-art style projects cuz it&#39;s cheap).</p> <p>Modern narratives tell you to &quot;use this asset&quot; or &quot;follow this trend.&quot; I don&#39;t see many &quot;real punks&quot; entering the scene anymore the last time I felt that raw energy was probably during the release of Hotline Miami.</p> <p>What do you think? Has gamedev lost its &quot;punk&quot; spirit due to corporate standardization and &quot;safe&quot; templates? Is this philosophy still relevant today, and is there a place for a product created in this &quot;extinct&quot; mental form?</p> <p>I might be romanticizing things or missing the reality of the time I’d love to hear your thoughts. To be clear, I’m not trying to say &quot;everything was better back then.&quot; My goal is to explore the specific mindset and the &quot;spirit of development&quot; of that era to see what can be learned or brought back today.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RomanLuka"> /u/RomanLuka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qktj1e/were_90s_game_developers_more_punk_than_today/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qktj1e/were_90s_game_developers_more_punk_than_today/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I couldn&#39;t find a good tool for this, so I decided to build <a href="https://github.com/mennanov/blockwatch">BlockWatch</a>!</p> <p>The idea is simple: you define &quot;blocks&quot; within your source code comments and then define validation rules for them:</p> <p><code>languages.rs:</code></p> <pre><code>enum Languages { // &lt;block affects=&quot;README.md:languages&quot; keep-sorted&gt; Java, Python, Rust, // &lt;/block&gt; } </code></pre> <p><code>README.md:</code></p> <pre><code># Supported languages &lt;!-- &lt;block name=&quot;languages&quot; keep-sorted keep-unique&gt; --&gt; - Java - Python - Rust &lt;!-- &lt;/block&gt; --&gt; </code></pre> <p>In this particular example <code>blockwatch</code> will make sure that all <code>Languages</code> enum variants are <strong>sorted</strong> and always in sync with the corresponding section of the docs in <code>README.md</code></p> <p><a href="https://i.redd.it/bh2jpjpqd5fg1.gif">BlockWatch in action</a></p> <p>It uses <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a> Rust bindings to extract comments from 20+ programming languages as using Regex is not a reliable option.</p> <p>Once comments are extracted the <a href="https://github.com/winnow-rs/winnow">winnow</a> parser reads the <code>block</code> definitions from them.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/mennanov/blockwatch#features"></a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Drift Detection</strong>: Link a block of code to its documentation. If you change the code but forget the docs, BlockWatch alerts you.</li> <li><strong>Strict Formatting</strong>: Enforce sorted lists (<code>keep-sorted</code>) and unique entries (<code>keep-unique</code>) so you don&#39;t have to nitpick in code reviews.</li> <li><strong>Content Validation</strong>: Check lines against Regex patterns (<code>line-pattern</code>) or enforce block size limits ( <code>line-count</code>).</li> <li><strong>AI Rules</strong>: Use natural language to validate code or text (e.g., &quot;Must mention &#39;banana&#39;&quot;).</li> <li><strong>Flexible</strong>: Run it on specific files, glob patterns, or just your unstaged changes.</li> </ul> <p><code>BlockWatch</code> can be used as a pre-commit hooks and as a workflow in GitHub Actions.</p> <p>Your feedback is very welcome!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In a go service I&#39;d like to if possible have a way to enforce at compile time (or use whatever is the idiomatic go way of enforcing) that:</p> <ol> <li>all queries are done using transactions - read queries in read transactions.</li> <li>all transactions are traced, so in my monitoring I have a span tree that includes the transactions and metadata about the transactions (durations, isolation levels, etc) used in the request. <ul> <li>In my head I was expecting this would come from the transaction context being created as a child of the higher level context, so the transaction context would have its own span and the span tree itself is managed by context as that naturally lends itself to the concept of children. Any query run within the transaction for example would have its own span that is a child span of the transaction span, same for any other code that gets run while within the transaction (that would be unfortunate, but this way there&#39;s an easy way of identifying in the monitoring if it does happen).</li> </ul></li> <li>context cancellations at higher levels go down the stack and rollback the transaction, for example tcp connection cancellations or my specific timeout settings to cancel long-running requests.</li> <li>paths through the service that require a write transaction are not callable from paths that use a read transaction explicitly, to ensure it isn&#39;t possible to accidentally call a write path when deep in the callstack for a read path which should be cacheable from any level.</li> <li>potential nested transactions should be treated as a no-op, but even better just disallowed by the type system itself at compile time.</li> </ol> <p>I did think about a solution of making functions that start the relevant transactions and return 3 values: the new ctx, the transaction itself, and an error for if the tx fails. But that feels icky for a few reasons:</p> <ol> <li>it&#39;s quite easy to miss the `defer tx.rollback()`, though this is seemingly a common pattern in go anyway so maybe that&#39;s not a problem - maybe I shouldn&#39;t write code when I&#39;m tired and that wouldn&#39;t be a problem!</li> <li>I&#39;ve never seen any go stdlib function or method return more than 2 values</li> <li>it&#39;s possible to accidentally disconnect the tx object from the context which would potentially lead to incorrect spans</li> </ol> <p>In other languages I&#39;d make the transaction stuff explicit and use something implicit like thread-locals or dynamic type trickery to have the instrumentation separate but still with a proper span tree including transaction information. But in go it seems explicit use of the context is preferred for instrumentation.</p> <p>For what it&#39;s worth please let me know if what I&#39;m currently doing of using (abusing?) the context object and its children for having a span tree is completely unidiomatic, I&#39;ve found it useful so far. The context just stores the current span id, span attributes, trace id, etc and the logger/instrumenter always takes a context so it can extract those values and include them for full rendering of span trees and flame graphs in my monitoring platform. The child spans (child contexts) can then inherit the things that are relevant like trace ids and have new span ids and span attributes.</p> <p>I guess I&#39;m just looking for what the idiomatic way in go is of achieving these sorts of goals for transactional workloads, especially when things like read/write splitting and cqrs start getting involved.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheFalstaff"> /u/TheFalstaff </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qla7oe/idiomatic_ways_of_linking_atomic_transactions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qla7oe/idiomatic_ways_of_linking_atomic_transactions/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a CLI called <code>sley</code> - a small tool to manage semantic versions via a plain text <code>.version</code> file. </p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/indaco/sley">https://github.com/indaco/sley</a></p> <p>The core idea is to have a <strong>single source of truth</strong> for versioning that works with any language or stack (Go, Node, Python, Rust, etc.). You store a version like <code>1.2.3</code> in a <code>.version</code> file, bump it when needed, and optionally wire it into your workflows via plugins and hooks.</p> <h2>Background</h2> <p>Started this about a year ago when I noticed a pattern repeating across my projects. In Go, I was using <code>//go:embed .version</code> to read version info. Then the same pattern worked for SvelteKit projects with a Vite plugin. Then came multi-stack projects with Go backends, SvelteKit frontends, and Python/Rust services - needed to version each component separately but also bump them all together when shipping unified releases.</p> <p>Released v0.5.0 back in April 2025 (which also included renaming the project from &quot;semver&quot; to &quot;sley&quot;), then work got busy and development stalled. Had a backlog of improvements and ideas from actually using the tool across my repos. Christmas break gave me time to pick it back up and work through that list.</p> <h2>Quick example</h2> <p><code>bash sley init # interactive: select plugins, creates .version and .sley.yaml sley init --migrate # or pull version from existing package.json/Cargo.toml sley show # prints current version sley bump patch # 1.2.3 -&gt; 1.2.4 sley bump minor # 1.2.4 -&gt; 1.3.0 sley bump auto # smart bump: strips pre-release or bumps patch sley set 2.0.0 --pre beta # set version with pre-release sley bump pre # 2.0.0-beta -&gt; 2.0.0-beta.1 sley bump pre --label rc # switch to 2.0.0-rc.1 sley tag create --push # create and push git tag sley changelog merge # merge versioned changelogs into CHANGELOG.md sley doctor # validate setup and configuration </code></p> <h2>Highlights</h2> <ul> <li>Uses a simple, readable <code>.version</code> file as the version source of truth</li> <li>Language-agnostic: works with any stack or build system</li> <li>Built-in plugins for: <ul> <li>git tagging</li> <li>changelog generation</li> <li>conventional commit parsing</li> <li>version validation / policy enforcement</li> </ul></li> <li>Extension hooks (pre/post bump) for custom scripts and automation</li> <li>Supports monorepos and multi-module repositories</li> <li>CI/CD friendly and deterministic</li> </ul> <p>Available via Homebrew, prebuilt binaries, and as an asdf plugin.</p> <p><strong>Transparency note:</strong> I used AI tooling for some scaffolding, refactors, tests, comments, and documentation. The core design and functionality are mine. This is documented in the README.</p> <p>Would appreciate feedback from the Go community, whether you&#39;re managing versions across multiple projects/monorepos or just giving it a try.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/indaco_dev"> /u/indaco_dev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qkwyae/sley_languageagnostic_semantic_version_management/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qkwyae/sley_languageagnostic_semantic_version_management/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;m aware there might be some tools out there that might achieve similar things, but I still wanted to take on the challenge myself.</p> <p>As a result, I built a small tool to handle the cases I kept tripping over and decided to share it with the community.</p> <p>The goal is very simple. <strong>Just get the files from one machine to other machines and be done with it. And with no other setup other than the installation itself.</strong></p> <p>It’s called <strong>Thruflux</strong>. It’s written in Go and uses direct peer-to-peer transfers over QUIC. Files go straight between machines, and each receiver connects independently - which also makes it possible to share the same data with more than one machine without restarting the transfer.</p> <p>Rough feature list:</p> <ul> <li>High throughput, direct P2P transfers over QUIC</li> <li>Tries to avoid relays via UDP hole-punching (STUN)</li> <li>Resume support if a connection drops</li> <li>One sender can serve multiple receivers</li> <li>Single static binary</li> <li>Two commands: <code>thru host</code> / <code>thru join</code></li> <li><strong>Works out of the box</strong> with default signaling, but everything can be self-hosted</li> </ul> <p>A few caveats:</p> <ul> <li>Still beta and actively evolving</li> <li>No default TURN relay yet (can be self-hosted)</li> <li>If there’s real usage, I’ll likely add a relay and maybe a GUI later</li> </ul> <p>The default signaling servers are capacity-limited but currently handle ~2k concurrent users.</p> <p>Since it is very easy to install and use, I hope some of you guys try it, and better yet, benefit from it in some way or the other.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a LAN discovery tool with a Terminal User Interface (TUI) written entirely in Go. It&#39;s called <strong>Whosthere</strong>, and it&#39;s designed to help you explore devices on your local network without requiring elevated privileges.</p> <p>It works by combining several discovery methods:</p> <ul> <li>mDNS and SSDP scanning</li> <li>ARP cache reading (after triggering ARP resolution via TCP/UDP sweeps)</li> <li>OUI lookups to identify device manufacturers</li> </ul> <p>It also includes:</p> <ul> <li>A fast, keyboard-driven TUI (powered by <a href="https://github.com/rivo/tview">tview</a>)</li> <li>An optional built-in port scanner</li> <li>Daemon mode with a simple HTTP API to fetch devices</li> <li>Configurable theming and behavior via a YAML config file</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why I built it:</strong><br/> Mainly to learn, I&#39;ve been programming in Go for about a year now and wanted to combine learning Go with learning more about networking in one single project. I&#39;ve always been a big fan of TUI applications like lazygit, k9s, and dive. And then the idea came to build a TUI application that shows devices on your LAN. I am by no means a networking expert, but it was fun to figure out how ARP works, and discovery protocols such as mDNS and SSDP.</p> <p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p> <pre><code># install via HomeBrew brew tap ramonvermeulen/whosthere brew install whosthere # or with go install go install github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere@latest # run as TUI whosthere # run as daemon whosthere daemon --port 8080 </code></pre> <p><strong>GitHub repo:</strong><br/> <a href="https://github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere">https://github.com/ramonvermeulen/whosthere</a></p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your feedback, if you have ideas for additional features or improvements that is highly appreciated! Current platform support is Linux and MacOS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Raya_98"> /u/Raya_98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qknfeu/whosthere_a_lan_discovery_tool_with_a_modern_tui/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qknfeu/whosthere_a_lan_discovery_tool_with_a_modern_tui/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>CKB (Code Knowledge Backend)</h1> <p>I built CKB in Go — it indexes your codebase using SCIP and exposes 80+ code intelligence queries through CLI, HTTP API, and MCP (Model Context Protocol for AI assistants).</p> <h2>What it does</h2> <p>CKB turns your repo into a queryable knowledge base. You ask structured questions about your code — symbol lookup, call graphs, reference tracing, impact analysis — and get precise answers instead of grepping around.</p> <p>```bash</p> <h1>What calls this function?</h1> <p>ckb query call-graph --symbol &quot;ProcessOrder&quot; --direction callers</p> <h1>What breaks if I rename this?</h1> <p>ckb query impact --symbol &quot;UserService.Create&quot;</p> <h1>What tests cover this code?</h1> <p>ckb query affected-tests --path internal/auth/</p> <h1>Architecture overview</h1> <p>ckb arch --format=human ```</p> <h2>Why Go?</h2> <ul> <li>Single binary, zero runtime dependencies</li> <li>Fast indexing — SCIP parsing + SQLite storage</li> <li>Concurrent backend orchestration (SCIP, LSP, Git backends queried in parallel)</li> <li>Bubble-free deployment — <code>go install</code>, Homebrew, npm wrapper, or Docker</li> <li>amazingly easy to build tools with &lt;3 </li> </ul> <h2>Architecture</h2> <p><code> CLI / HTTP API / MCP Server ↓ Query Engine (internal/query/) ↓ Backend Orchestrator ↓ SCIP | LSP | Git backends ↓ SQLite storage layer </code></p> <p>The query engine uses a three-tier cache (query → view → negative) and a &quot;backend ladder&quot; that tries SCIP first, falls back to LSP, then Git-based heuristics. Results are merged using configurable strategies and compressed to fit LLM response budgets.</p> <h2>Interesting Go patterns used</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Fingerprint-based symbol identity</strong> — symbols get stable IDs (<code>ckb:&lt;repo&gt;:sym:&lt;hash&gt;</code>) that survive renames via alias chains</li> <li><strong>Tree-sitter integration</strong> for cyclomatic/cognitive complexity scoring</li> <li><strong>SSE streaming</strong> for long-running MCP operations</li> <li><strong>Response budget enforcement</strong> — output is compressed/truncated to fit token limits with drilldown suggestions for truncated results</li> </ul> <h2>Supported languages (for indexing)</h2> <p>Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C++, Dart, Ruby, C#</p> <h2>Install</h2> <p>```bash</p> <h1>Go install</h1> <p>go install github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP/cmd/ckb@latest</p> <h1>Homebrew</h1> <p>brew tap SimplyLiz/ckb &amp;&amp; brew install ckb</p> <h1>npm (wraps the binary)</h1> <p>npm install -g @tastehub/ckb</p> <h1>Then:</h1> <p>ckb init &amp;&amp; ckb index ```</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP">https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP</a></li> <li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://codeknowledge.dev">https://codeknowledge.dev</a></li> </ul> <hr/> <p>Feedback on the architecture or API design welcome.
