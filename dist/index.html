I have 3 crates, client, server, shared.</p> <p>Item, is one of those types for example. Item has 2 fields `id` and `amount`. I want to change the type of the field based off what crate is using the shared crate. Eg the client, the `id` field should be of type u16. But in the server, I want the `id` type to be a `ItemId` (enum repr u16 type for item constants). The client can&#39;t use the same type since `ItemId` wont always be up to date with the latest items in game (we can add items without releasing new client updates).</p> <p>This is what I&#39;ve got so far, and its fine when building the specific crate (eg client or server) but if u try to build the workspace itself, it fails.</p> <p>Item.rs inside shared:</p> <pre><code>pub struct Item { pub id: ItemIdType, } #[cfg(not(feature = &quot;server&quot;))] pub type ItemIdType = u16; #[cfg(feature = &quot;server&quot;)] pub type ItemIdType = String; </code></pre> <p>Example use of client with u16 type: ```rust use shared::Item;</p> <p>fn main() { // Client project, NO server feature let test = Item { id: 123 }; println!( &quot;We are a u16 since we&#39;re NOT using the server feature! {:?}&quot;, test.id ); } ```</p> <p>Example use of server with String type: ```rust use shared::Item;</p> <p>fn main() { // Server project, YES server feature let test = Item { id: String::from(&quot;Hello&quot;), }; println!( &quot;We are a String since we ARE using the server feature! {:?}&quot;, test.id ); } ```</p> <p>My issue is when running cargo build in the workspace, it gives an error saying client was failed to build due to incorrect item id type. But if I run cargo build inside the client directory it works fine.</p> <p><code> error[E0308]: mismatched types --&gt; client/src/main.rs:5:27 | 5 | let test = Item { id: 123 }; | ^^^- help: try using a conversion method: `.to_string()` | | | expected `String`, found integer </code></p> <p>I don&#39;t really understand why this isnt valid, and not quite sure how to achieve what I want without duplicating the struct inside server and client.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>I just released a small crate called <code>deferred-cell</code> that helps build <em>cyclic or self-referential</em> structures using <code>Rc&lt;Weak&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, without requiring interior mutability like <code>RefCell</code>.</p> <h1>What it does:</h1> <p><code>Deferred&lt;T&gt;</code> is a weak reference wrapper that starts uninitialized and can be assigned <strong>once</strong>. After that, it&#39;s read-only, great for write-once graphs like:</p> <ul> <li>cyclic trees</li> <li>game maps with bidirectional links</li> <li>bidirected data structures</li> </ul> <p>Instead of <code>RefCell&lt;Option&lt;Weak&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, you can use this:</p> <pre><code>let node = Rc::new(Node { neighbor: Deferred::default() }); SetOnce::from(&amp;node.neighbor).try_set(&amp;other_node)?; </code></pre> <h1>Why I built it:</h1> <p>I was building a text adventure game engine and ran into a common headache: my entity schema had a lot of circular dependencies. Modeling that in Rust was tricky.</p> <p>At first, I broke the cycles by using lookup maps to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; on demand. It worked, but it felt clunky, and it made me wonder: is there a cleaner way?</p> <p>Most graph libraries were overkill for my use case, and I really didn‚Äôt want to reach for <code>RefCell</code>, especially when I only needed <strong>mutability once</strong> during setup. Then I found <code>OnceCell</code>, which is great, but it needed a bit more to really fit. So I built <code>deferred-cell</code>.</p> <p>I haven‚Äôt actually plugged it into the game engine yet. Upon deeper review, I realized that the graph is dynamic in most places, so this would mainly help with only one entity type. Regardless, I thought it might be useful to others, or at least spark some discussion.</p> <h1>Links:</h1> <ul> <li>üì¶ Crate: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/deferred-cell">https://crates.io/crates/deferred-cell</a></li> <li>üìö Docs: <a href="https://docs.rs/deferred-cell">https://docs.rs/deferred-cell</a></li> <li>üõ† GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/BernardIgiri/deferred-cell">https://github.com/BernardIgiri/deferred-cell</a></li> <li>üéÆ Inspired by: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1lokqyh/text_adventure_game/">https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1lokqyh/text_adventure_game/</a></li> </ul> <p>I would love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or contributions.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In the last two months I&#39;ve been working on adding support for the (rather large) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">Temporal</a> datetime API to V8, Chromium&#39;s JS engine. The meat of this implementation is all Rust. </p> <p>Firefox already has an implementation using <a href="https://github.com/unicode-org/ICU4X">ICU4X</a>. For V8 we&#39;re using <a href="https://github.com/boa-dev/temporal">temporal_rs</a>, which builds on top of ICU4X but does more of the spec-specific stuff. This wouldn&#39;t be the first Rust in Chromium, but it&#39;s a significant chunk of code! You can see most of the glue code in V8 in <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:v8/src/objects/js-temporal-objects.cc">here</a>, and you can look at all of the CLs <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/hashtag:%22temporal%22+(status:open%20OR%20status:merged">here</a>).</p> <p>There&#39;s still a bunch of work to do on test conformance, but now is a point where we can at least say it is fully implemented API-wise.</p> <p>I&#39;m happy to answer any questions people may have! I&#39;m pretty excited to see this finally happen, it&#39;s a long-desired improvement to the JS standard library, and it&#39;s cool to see it being done using Rust.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Manishearth"> /u/Manishearth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1logjzt/chromiumv8_implementing_temporal_api_via_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1logjzt/chromiumv8_implementing_temporal_api_via_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I was thinking of parsing a toml file in the build script and generate the code with TokenStream, but I wanted to know if you have any better recommendation, if there is already a lib that&#39;d help me with that.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hbacelar8"> /u/hbacelar8 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1loerth/how_to_configure_library_parameters/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1loerth/how_to_configure_library_parameters/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to implement a `children` method for my AST, and I&#39;m not sure which approach is more idiomatic. </p> <p>This is the first version, a plain Rust encoding of my AST. For now let&#39;s consider we have only two enums.</p> <pre><code>enum Expression { Binary { left: Box&lt;Expression&gt;, op: String, right: Box&lt;Expression&gt;, }, Unary { expr: Box&lt;Expression&gt;, op: String, }, Identifier(String), } enum Statement { If { cond: Expression, consequence: Box&lt;Statement&gt;, alternative: Box&lt;Statement&gt;, }, Block { statements: Vec&lt;Statement&gt;, }, Expression { expr: Expression, }, } </code></pre> <p>The first attempt to implement the children method was to use a trait object. This is very Java-ish: i.e., `TreeNode` acting as a top-level interface. </p> <pre><code>trait TreeNode { fn children(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;dyn TreeNode&gt;; } impl TreeNode for Statement { fn children(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;dyn TreeNode&gt; { match self { Statement::If { cond, consequence, alternative, } =&gt; vec![cond, consequence.deref(), alternative.deref()], Statement::Block { statements } =&gt; statements.iter().map(|s| s as &amp;dyn TreeNode).collect(), Statement::Expression { expr } =&gt; vec![expr], } } } </code></pre> <p>If I want to use enums to represent `TreeNode` and avoid dynamic dispatch, I can come up with the following two solutions:</p> <p>Having an enum that keeps references to the actual nodes. Essentially, this provides a `TreeNode` view hierarchy for AST nodes. This approach seems to be working fine but feels a bit odd.</p> <pre><code>enum TreeNode&lt;&#39;a&gt; { Expression(&amp;&#39;a Expression), Statement(&amp;&#39;a Statement), } impl&lt;&#39;a&gt; Statement { fn children(&amp;&#39;a self) -&gt; Vec&lt;TreeNode&lt;&#39;a&gt;&gt; { match self { Statement::If { cond, consequence, alternative, } =&gt; vec![ TreeNode::Expression(cond), TreeNode::Statement(consequence), TreeNode::Statement(alternative), ], Statement::Block { statements } =&gt; statements.iter().map(|s| Node::Statement(s)).collect(), Statement::Expression { expr } =&gt; vec![Node::Expression(expr)], } } } </code></pre> <p>Or having an enum that owns data, but for that I need to change the whole AST as I cannot move out the data when calling the children. So I&#39;ll end up something like this:</p> <pre><code>enum TreeNode { Expression(Expression), Statement(Statement), } enum Statement { If { cond: Box&lt;TreeNode&gt;, consequence: Box&lt;TreeNode&gt;, alternative: Box&lt;TreeNode&gt;, }, Block { statements: Vec&lt;TreeNode&gt;, }, Expression { expr: Box&lt;TreeNode&gt;, }, } ... impl Statement { fn children(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;TreeNode&gt; { match self { Statement::If { cond, consequence, alternative, } =&gt; vec![cond, consequence, alternative], Statement::Block { statements } =&gt; statements.iter().collect(), Statement::Expression { expr } =&gt; vec![expr], } } } </code></pre> <p>The last version is kind of annoying as there is an indirection for each node, which makes matching more annoying.</p> <p>Which version is the best? Are there other possibilities here? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wickerman07"> /u/wickerman07 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lo8lfb/whats_the_best_way_to_implement_a_children_method/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lo8lfb/whats_the_best_way_to_implement_a_children_method/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Introducing;</p> <p><strong>Ansic</strong> the new crate solving the pain of building ansi styled applications with <em>clean syntax</em> and the magic of proc macros -- with üöÄ <strong><em>zero</em></strong> runtime overhead and <code>#[no_std]</code> support</p> <p>Most ansi crates uses <strong>inconvenient</strong> syntax for styling and display types and calculates the ansi style at runtime, which for applications with alot of styles or optimizations isn&#39;t ideal. Other crates also don&#39;t have a clean reusable model for ansi strings and alot of weird chaining and storing methods are used for it to be used.</p> <p>Ansic solves those problems with a clean and reusable proc macro which uses a clean and convenient DSL which outputs raw string literals at compile time for <strong>ZERO</strong> runtime overhead.</p> <p>Usage:</p> <p>The <code>ansi!()</code> macro is the foundation of ansic, in here you write all your DSL expressions to define a style and it spits out the raw &amp;str literal.</p> <p>Ansic has two different types of expressions separated by a space for each; Styles and colors.</p> <p>Colors: Colors are simply written with their names (like &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red) but every single color supports extra arguments prefixed or postfixed by writing the format: <code>argument.color</code> where each argument is with a dot before the color. There are two arguments for colors:</p> <ul> <li>br (bright)</li> <li>bg (background)</li> </ul> <p>(by default if you dont provide the bg argument to a color its treated as a foreground color)</p> <p>so let&#39;s say you want to make a ansi style which is a bright red foreground, then you can write <code>ansi!(br.red)</code>, and it will output the string literal for the ansi equivalent, and if you want a bright red foreground with a bright green background you can do <code>ansi!(br.red bg.br.green)</code>. We also support 24bit rgb with the color syntax <code>rgb(r, g, b)</code>.</p> <p>We also have styles (they don&#39;t take arguments) with for example the <code>underline</code> and <code>bold</code> styles with <code>ansi!(br.red underline bg.green bold)</code> for example (bright red foreground underline green background and bold ansi).</p> <p>(check our <a href="http://docs.rs">docs.rs</a> page <a href="https://docs.rs/ansic">Ansic - docs.rs</a> for full specs, features and lists of supported styles and colors)</p> <p>Ansic also encourages a consistent and reusable and simple architecture for styling with const:</p> <pre><code>use ansic::ansi; const ERROR: &amp;&#39;static str = ansi!(red bold underline); const R: &amp;&#39;static str = ansi!(reset); fn main() { println!(&quot;{ERROR}ERROR: something wrong happened!{R}&quot;); } </code></pre> <p>This encourages a reuseable, elegant and very easy way to style which muss less overhead (contradicting other crates with much less readable and elegant styles of styling)</p> <p>üõ†Ô∏è I built <code>ansic</code> because I was frustrated with other ansi crates:</p> <p>It was hard to read, reuse and manage weirdly chained styles, and I hated that every time I used it there was a runtime calculation to make the styles even work. I love <code>ansic</code> because it solves all those problems with a clean reuseable model, DSL which is easy to read and maintain, and a proc macro which does everything at compile time.</p> <p>I&#39;m also 100% open to feedback, reviews, discussions and criticism!</p> <p>üé® Add ansic to style with ansi with <code>cargo add ansic</code>!</p> <p>üåü If you like the project, please consider leaving a star on our <a href="https://github.com/zeonzip/ansic">GitHub page</a>!</p> <ul> <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/zeonzip/ansic">https://github.com/zeonzip/ansic</a></li> <li>Crates.io: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ansic">https://crates.io/crates/ansic</a></li> <li>Docs: <a href="https://docs.rs/ansic">https://docs.rs/ansic</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pitiful-Run983"> /u/Pitiful-Run983 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lo7q9e/introducing_ansic_a_blazing_fast_proc_macro_zero/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lo7q9e/introducing_ansic_a_blazing_fast_proc_macro_zero/">[comments]</a></span></div>

We hope that it can eventually be contributed to the Apache community and become a top project of the Apache community, contributing our own share of strength to the Apache and Rust communities. </p> <p>Some information about RobustMQ: </p> <ol> <li>Original intention: To explore the possibility of combining Rust with message queues, and solve the existing problems of the message queue components in the current community.</li> <li>Positioning: An All In One open-source message queue developed 100% based on the Rust language.</li> <li>Goal: To deliver a message queue that supports multiple mainstream messaging protocols, has a completely Serverless architecture, is low-cost, and elastic.</li> <li>Features:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>100% Rust: A message queue engine implemented entirely based on the Rust language.</li> <li>Multiple protocols: Supports MQTT 3.1/3.1.1/5.0, AMQP, Kafka Protocol, RocketMQ Remoting/GRPC, OpenMessing, JNS, SQS, etc., the mainstream messaging protocols.</li> <li>Hierarchical architecture: A three-layer architecture with completely independent computing, storage, and scheduling, with clear responsibilities and independence.</li> <li>Serverless: All components have distributed cluster deployment capabilities and the ability to quickly scale up and down.</li> <li>Plugin-based storage: An independent plugin-based storage layer implementation, supporting both independent deployment and shared storage architectures.</li> <li>Comprehensive functions: Fully aligns with the functions and capabilities of the mainstream MQ products in the corresponding communities. </li> </ul> <p>For more detailed information, please visit our Github homepage and official website: </p> <ul> <li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq">https://github.com/robustmq/robustmq</a></li> <li>Website: <a href="https://robustmq.com/">https://robustmq.com/</a></li> </ul> <p>We have currently completed the development of the first release version, including the overall architecture and the adaptation of the MQTT protocol. Next, we plan to further improve the MQTT, refine the stability, and then prepare for compatibility with the Kafka protocol. </p> <p>At this stage, we would like to hear your suggestions. We hope to know whether this action makes sense and what areas for improvement there are. So that we can stay on the right track and do this well. </p> <p>We know this is a difficult task, but we think it&#39;s a really cool thing and we want to give it a try. We are looking forward to the community&#39;s suggestions. </p> <p>Cool! Let&#39;s do something fun together~. </p> <p>At the same time, we also hope to find students who are interested in implementing infrastructure components, message queues, and distributed storage systems using Rust, and together explore the unlimited possibilities of Rust in the field of infrastructure. </p> <p>Best wishes!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wenqiang_lobo"> /u/wenqiang_lobo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lnzkjq/we_are_rewriting_the_message_queue_in_rust_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lnzkjq/we_are_rewriting_the_message_queue_in_rust_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I know the answer, but a bit of a sanity check,,,</p> <p>I&#39;m a relative Go Newbie. We have a Go app running in a Docker (Ubuntu) container. This calls a C/C++ library (C interface, but C++ under the hood) via cgo. Yes I am aware of the dangers of that, but this library depends on a 3rd party C++ library and uses x64 intrinsics. The 3rd party library is slowly being ported to Go but it isn&#39;t ready yet for prime time; and of course there&#39;s the time to port our library to Golang: I&#39;ve seen worse, but not trivial either!</p> <p>Memory allocation is a potential issue, and I will investigate the latest GC options. Most of the memory allocation is in the C++ library (potentially many GB). Am I right in thinking that the C++ memory allocation will be separate from Golang&#39;s heap? And Golang does not set any limits on the library allocations? (other than OS-wide ulimit settings of course)</p> <p>In other words, both Golang and the C++ library will take all the physical memory they can? And allocate/manage memory independently of each other?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/winwaed"> /u/winwaed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1loqmgt/heap_management_with_go_cgo/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1loqmgt/heap_management_with_go_cgo/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve got a bunch of plants that I&#39;m trying to get to level 10.</p> <p>Built the main logic in Go, TypeScript + React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL with PostGIS for all the geospatial queries, though a bunch of that stuff happens in the service layer too. The geospatial stuff was interesting to work out, I ended up implementing plants and soils as circles since it makes the overlap detection and containment math way simpler. Figuring out when a plant fits inside a soil area or when two plants would overlap becomes basic circle geometry instead of dealing with complex polygons.</p> <p>Plants decay every 4 hours unless you water them recently (there&#39;s a grace period system). Got a bunch of other mechanics like different soil types and plant tempers that are not fully integrated into the project right now. Just wanted to get the core loop working first and see how people actually use it.</p> <p>You just need to get within like 10 meters of your plant to water it, but I&#39;m still playing with these values to see what ends up being a good fit. Used to have it at 5 metres before but it made development a pain.

And I don&#39;t know if kotlin has more or less features but I have the impression that in every code review I see something new. A weird language construct or function from the runtime library that should improve something by getting rid of a few characters. If you are familiar with a programming language you do not see the problems so clearly, but know I am aware how much kotlin (and probably C#) can suck.</p> <p>When I work with go, I just understand it. There is only one way to do something and not 10. I struggle with generics a little bit, but overall it is a great experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sebastianstehle"> /u/sebastianstehle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lo2b64/i_just_want_to_express_my_appreciation_for_golang/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lo2b64/i_just_want_to_express_my_appreciation_for_golang/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been doing Linux ops in air-gapped environments for about a year. Mostly RHEL systems with lots of automation. My workflow is basically 75% bash and 25% Ansible.</p> <p>Bash has been solid for most of my scripting needs. My mentor believes Python scripts are more resilient than bash and I agree with him in theory but for most file operations the extra verbosity isn&#39;t worth it.</p> <p>So far I&#39;ve only used Python in prod in like 2-3 situations. First I wrote an inventory script for Ansible right around the time I introduced the framework itself to our shop. Later I wrote a simple script that sends email reminders to replace certain keys we have. Last thing I built with it was a PyGObject GUI though funny story there. Took a week to build in Python then rewrote it in bash with YAD in an afternoon.</p> <p>Python&#39;s stdlib is honestly impressive and covers most of what I need without external dependencies. But we&#39;ve got version management headaches. Desktops run 3.12 for Ansible but servers are locked to 3.8 due to factory requirements. System still depends on 3.6 and most of the RPM&#39;s are built against 3.6 (RHEL 8).</p> <p>Started exploring Go recently for a specific use case. Performance-critical stuff with our StorNext CVFS. In my case with venv and dependencies on CVFS performance has been a little rough. The compiled binary approach seems ideal for this. Just rsync the binary to the server and it runs. Done.</p> <p>The other benefit I&#39;ve noticed is the compiler feedback. Getting LSPs and linters through security approval is a long exhausting process so having the compiler catch issues upfront, and so quickly, helps a lot. Especially when dealing with the constant firefighting.</p> <p>Not saying Python is bad or Go is better. Just finding Go fits this particular niche really well.</p> <p>Wondering if other devops or linux sysadmins have found themselves in a similar spot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Resource_account"> /u/Resource_account </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lnz0w2/go_makes_sense_in_airgapped_ops_environments/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lnz0w2/go_makes_sense_in_airgapped_ops_environments/">[comments]</a></span></div>
