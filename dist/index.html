It proved you could actually run <em>real databases</em> on the web.</p> <p>But it came with a huge flaw: <strong>your data was stuck</strong>. Once it went into IndexedDB, there was no exporting, no importing, no backups‚Äîno way out.</p> <p>So I built <strong>AbsurderSQL</strong> ‚Äî a ground-up Rust + WebAssembly reimplementation that fixes that problem completely. It‚Äôs absurd-sql, but absurder.</p> <p>Written in Rust, it uses a custom VFS that treats IndexedDB like a disk with 4KB blocks, intelligent caching, and optional observability. It runs <strong>both in-browser and natively</strong>. And your data? 100% portable.</p> <h1>Why I Built It</h1> <p>I was modernizing a legacy VBA app into a Next.js SPA with one constraint: no server-side persistence. It had to be fully offline. IndexedDB was the only option, but it‚Äôs anything but relational.</p> <p>Then I found absurd-sql. It got me 80% there‚Äîbut the last 20% involved painful lock-in and portability issues. That frustration led to this rewrite.</p> <h1>Your Data, Anywhere.</h1> <p>AbsurderSQL lets you <strong><em>export to and import from standard SQLite files</em></strong>, not proprietary blobs.</p> <pre><code>import init, { Database } from &#39;@npiesco/absurder-sql&#39;; await init(); const db = await Database.newDatabase(&#39;myapp.db&#39;); await db.execute(&quot;CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)&quot;); await db.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, &#39;Alice&#39;)&quot;); // Export the real SQLite file const bytes = await db.exportToFile(); </code></pre> <p>That file works everywhere‚ÄîCLI, Python, Rust, DB Browser, etc.<br/> You can back it up, commit it, share it, or reimport it in any browser.</p> <h1>Dual-Mode Architecture</h1> <p><strong>One codebase, two modes.</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Browser (WASM):</strong> IndexedDB-backed SQLite database with caching, tabs coordination, and export/import.</li> <li><strong>Native (Rust):</strong> Same API, but uses the filesystem‚Äîhandy for servers or CLI utilities.</li> </ul> <p>Perfect for offline-first apps that occasionally sync to a backend.</p> <h1>Multi-Tab Coordination That Just Works</h1> <p>AbsurderSQL ships with built‚Äëin leader election and write coordination:</p> <ul> <li>One leader tab handles writes</li> <li>Followers queue writes to the leader</li> <li>BroadcastChannel notifies all tabs of data changes No data races, no corruption.</li> </ul> <h1>Performance</h1> <p>IndexedDB is slow, sure‚Äîbut caching, batching, and async Rust I/O make a huge difference:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align="left">Operation</th> <th align="left">absurd‚Äësql</th> <th align="left">AbsurderSQL</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align="left">100k row read</td> <td align="left">~2.5s</td> <td align="left">~0.8s (cold) / ~0.05s (warm)</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">10k row write</td> <td align="left">~3.2s</td> <td align="left">~0.6s</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <h1>Rust From Ground Up</h1> <p>absurd-sql patched C++/JS internals; AbsurderSQL is idiomatic Rust:</p> <ul> <li>Safe and fast async I/O (no Asyncify bloat)</li> <li>Full ACID transactions</li> <li>Block-level CRC checksums</li> <li>Optional Prometheus/OpenTelemetry support (~660 KB gzipped WASM build)</li> </ul> <h1>What‚Äôs Next</h1> <ul> <li>Mobile support (same Rust core compiled for iOS/Android)</li> <li>WASM Component Model integration</li> <li>Pluggable storage backends for future browser APIs</li> </ul> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/npiesco/absurder-sql">npiesco/absurder-sql</a><br/> <strong>License:</strong> AGPL‚Äë3.0</p> <p>James Long showed that SQLite in the browser was possible.<br/> AbsurderSQL shows it can be <em>production‚Äëgrade</em>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard-Ad9181"> /u/Standard-Ad9181 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o7t3o2/absurdersql/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o7t3o2/absurdersql/">[comments]</a></span></div>

One of the places where TypeScript shines the most in my opinion is in ORMs like <a href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma">Prisma</a> and <a href="https://github.com/drizzle-team">Drizzle</a>. Both of these ask you to write exactly two things: Your database schema, and your queries. Notably however you <em>don&#39;t</em> have to specify the <em>return value</em> of a given query, because these can be inferred in TypeScript type land automatically. You get full type-safety and auto-completions whenever you adjust your query. This is something that is just impossible in a &quot;normal language&quot; (say Java) without an annoying code generation build step. But Rust ain&#39;t no normal language, am I right?</p> <p>Exploring the Rust world of database access I was of course excited by crates like sqlx. However, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that none of the big ORMs give me the developer ergonomics that I&#39;ve come to expect from Prisma and Drizzle. Most of them make me write the query, and then also the Rust struct to fill the result into. They also usually don&#39;t make much use of Rust&#39;s procedural macros. &quot;Relational queries&quot;, meaning the 1:N queries Prisma and Drizzle do wonderfully, are also rarely executed in the way I was looking for.</p> <p>I wanted to explore how far Rust macros can be pushed to recreate Prisma&#39;s and Drizzle&#39;s type magic, and this is how Kosame was born. It&#39;s just a rough prototype at the moment and I don&#39;t recommend using it. It only supports Postgres for now and there are a ton of features I still want to implement. But, I couldn&#39;t resist showing what I&#39;ve built so far and am looking forward to hearing your feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PikachuIsBoss"> /u/PikachuIsBoss </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/pikaju/kosame">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o7jxlq/kosame_a_new_rust_orm_inspired_by_prisma_and/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been developing oxidize-pdf, a Rust native library for parsing and writing PDFs from scratch. While there are other PDF libraries in Rust (notably lopdf), oxidize-pdf is designed specifically for production document processing workflows: text extraction, OCR integration, and batch processing at scale.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to share what I&#39;ve achieved so far, and I thought the best way was to provide a functional example of what oxidize-pdf is able to do. This example is mainly focused on batch-parallel processing of hundreds of files. The main features that you will find in this examples are:</p> <ul> <li>Parallel processing using Rayon with configurable workers</li> <li>Individual error isolation - failed files don&#39;t stop the batch</li> <li>Progress tracking with real-time statistics</li> <li>Dual output modes: console for monitoring, JSON for automation</li> <li>Comprehensive error reporting</li> </ul> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Processing 772 PDFs on an Intel i9 MacBook Pro took approximately 1 minute with parallelization versus 10 minutes sequentially.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the core processing logic:</p> <pre><code>rust pub fn process_batch(files: &amp;[PathBuf], config: &amp;BatchConfig) -&gt; BatchResult { let progress = ProgressBar::new(files.len() as u64); let results = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::new())); files.par_iter().for_each(|path| { let result = match process_single_pdf(path) { Ok(data) =&gt; ProcessingResult { filename: path.file_name().unwrap().to_string_lossy().to_string(), success: true, pages: Some(data.page_count), text_chars: Some(data.text.len()), duration_ms: data.duration.as_millis() as u64, error: None, }, Err(e) =&gt; ProcessingResult { filename: path.file_name().unwrap().to_string_lossy().to_string(), success: false, pages: None, text_chars: None, duration_ms: 0, error: Some(e.to_string()), }, }; results.lock().unwrap().push(result); progress.inc(1); }); progress.finish(); aggregate_results(results) } </code></pre> <p>Usage is straightforward:</p> <pre><code>bash # Basic usage cargo run --example batch_processing --features rayon -- --dir ./pdfs # JSON output for pipeline integration cargo run --example batch_processing --features rayon -- --dir ./pdfs --json ``` The error handling approach is straightforward: each file is processed independently. Failures are logged and reported at the end, but don&#39;t interrupt the batch: ``` ‚úÖ 749 successful | ‚ùå 23 failed ‚ùå Failed files: ‚Ä¢ corrupted.pdf - Invalid PDF structure ‚Ä¢ locked.pdf - Permission denied ‚Ä¢ encrypted.pdf - Encryption not supported </code></pre> <p>The JSON output mode makes it easy to integrate with existing workflows:</p> <pre><code>json { &quot;total&quot;: 772, &quot;successful&quot;: 749, &quot;failed&quot;: 23, &quot;throughput_docs_per_sec&quot;: 12.8, &quot;results&quot;: [...] } </code></pre> <p><strong>Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bzsanti/oxidizePdf">github.com/bzsanti/oxidizePdf</a></p> <p>I&#39;m interested in feedback, particularly regarding edge cases or integration patterns I haven&#39;t considered.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bytaro"> /u/bytaro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o7jmyy/parallel_batch_processing_for_pdfs_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o7jmyy/parallel_batch_processing_for_pdfs_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is inspired by the <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">Pomofocus</a> web app. Unfortunately, it is not open-source and only available on the web, so I decided to create an open-source desktop version: <a href="https://github.com/SzilvasiPeter/icemodoro">https://github.com/SzilvasiPeter/icemodoro</a></p> <h1>Dev details</h1> <p>I have started with <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced">iced</a>, but I got disappointed when I found out that there is no number input in the default library, so I switched to <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">egui</a> library. There, I was unable to make the layout as pleased the eyes, then I resumed the abandoned Iced project. Luckily, there is the <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced_aw">iced_aw</a> advanced widget library where you can use <code>number_input</code> and <code>tabs</code> widget. I continued with great pleasure, and finished implementing all features that I am considering to use.</p> <p>The deployment was another very <del>frustrating</del> enjoyable part of the project. Especially, when founding out the <code>moonrepo/setup-rust@v1</code> GitHub action which does not just install Rust but caches the build and registry folders, too. The cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) compilations took several debug sessions to fix, but in the end it was worth the effort. Finally, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz">release-plz</a>, publishing to <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> was straightforward.</p> <h1>Issues</h1> <p>On Linux, there are a lot of difference between the CPU (<code>tiny-skia</code>) and GPU (<code>wgpu</code>) rendering engines. Also, the inconsistencies between the X11 and Wayland protocols are very annoying. For example, Wayland has problem with CPU rendering - <em>flickering when the theme is changed -</em> while X11 has problem when <strong>ALT+TAB</strong> in the application.</p> <p>I am curious how the <a href="https://github.com/SzilvasiPeter/icemodoro">icemodoro</a> works in other systems. Currently, the <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code>, <code>x86_64-pc-windows-gnu</code> targets are available, therefore you can install quickly with <code>cargo-binstall icemodoro</code> command without compilation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SzilvasiPeter"> /u/SzilvasiPeter </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o75puf/a_simple_pomodoro_and_todo_application_using_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o75puf/a_simple_pomodoro_and_todo_application_using_the/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But the grass isn&#39;t greener on the other side: Java.</p> <p>I started to program in Java at my 9-5 earlier this year. Oh boy, how much I miss Golang.</p> <p>It never clicked with me why people complained so much about the &quot;magic&quot; in Java. I mean, it was doing the heavy lifting, right? And you were just creating the factory for that service, right? You have to register that factory somewhere, right?</p> <p>I finally understand what it means. You have no idea how much I HATE the magic that Java uses. It is basically impossible to know where the rockets are coming from. You just accept that something, somewhere will call your factory - if you set the correct profile. `@Service` my ass.</p> <p>Good luck trying to find who is validating the JWT token you are receiving. Where the hell is the PEM being set? This is where I had some luck leveraging LLMs: finding where the code was being called</p> <p>And don&#39;t get me started on ORMs. I used a lot of TypeORM, and I believe that it is an awesome ORM. But Hibernate is a fucked up version of it. What&#39;s with all the Eager fetch types? And with the horrible queries it writes? Why doesn&#39;t it just JOIN, rather than run these 40 additional queries? Why is it loading banking data when I just need the name?</p> <p>It sucks, and sucks hard. HQL is the worst aberration someone could ever have coded. Try reading its source. We don&#39;t need yet another query language. There&#39;s SQL exactly for that.</p> <p>And MapStruct. Oh my God. Why do you need a lib to map your model to a DTO? Why? What do you gain by doing this? How can you add a breakpoint to it? Don&#39;t get me started on the code generation bs.</p> <p>I mean, I think I was in the middle of the Gaussian. I&#39;ll just get back to writing some Golang. Simple model with some query builder. Why not, right?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious-Writer8396"> /u/Delicious-Writer8396 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7u5b6/a_completely_unproductive_but_truthful_rant_about/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7u5b6/a_completely_unproductive_but_truthful_rant_about/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7i34w/why_i_built_a_39m_ops_zeroallocation_ring_buffer/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/golang">r/golang</a></p> <p>I wanted to share the journey behind building a core component for a project of mine, hoping the design choices might be interesting for discussion. The component is a high-performance ring buffer for file change events.</p> <p>The Problem: Unreliable and Slow File Watching</p> <p>For a configuration framework I was building, I needed a hot reload mechanism that was both rock solid and very fast. The standard approaches had drawbacks:</p> <p>1) fsnotify: It‚Äôs powerful, but it‚Äôs behavior can be inconsistent across different OSs (especially macOS and inside Docker), leading to unpredictable behavior in production.</p> <p>2) Channels: While idiomatic, for an MPSC (Multiple Producer, Single Consumer) scenario with extreme performance goals, the overhead of channel operations and context switching can become a bottleneck. My benchmarks showed a custom solution could be over 30% faster.</p> <p>The Goal: A Deterministic, Zero-Allocation Engine</p> <p>I set out to build a polling-based file watching engine with a few non-negotiable goals:</p> <ul> <li><p>Deterministic behavior: It had to work the same everywhere.</p></li> <li><p>Zero-allocation hot path: No GC pressure during the event write/read cycle.</p></li> <li><p>Every nanosecond counted.</p></li> </ul> <p>This led me to design BoreasLite, a lock-free MPSC ring buffer. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works.</p> <p>1) The Core: A Ring Buffer with Atomic Cursors</p> <p>Instead of locks, BoreasLite uses atomic operations on two cursors (writerCursor, readerCursor) to manage access. Producers (goroutines detecting file changes) claim a slot by atomically incrementing the writerCursor. The single consumer (the event processor) reads up to the last known writer position.</p> <p>2) The Data Structure: Cache-Line Aware Struct </p> <p>To avoid &quot;false sharing&quot; in a multi-core environment, the event struct is padded to be exactly 128 bytes, fitting neatly into two cache lines on most modern CPUs.</p> <p>// From boreaslite.go type FileChangeEvent struct { Path [110]byte // 110 bytes for max path compatibility PathLen uint8 // Actual path length ModTime int64 // Unix nanoseconds Size int64 // File size Flags uint8 // Create/Delete/Modify bits _ [0]byte // Ensures perfect 128-byte alignment }</p> <p>The buffer&#39;s capacity is always a power of 2, allowing for ultra-fast indexing using a bitmask (sequence &amp; mask) instead of a slower modulo operator.</p> <p>The Result: ~39M ops/sec Performance</p> <p>The isolated benchmarks for this component were very rewarding. In single-event mode (the most common scenario for a single config file), the entire write-to-process cycle achieves:</p> <p>‚Ä¢ Latency: 25.63 ns/op ‚Ä¢ Throughput: 39.02 Million op/s ‚Ä¢ Memory: 0 allocs/op</p> <p>This design proved to be 34.3% faster than a buffered channel implementation for the same MPSC workload.</p> <p>This ring buffer is the engine that powers my configuration framework, Argus, but I thought the design itself would be a fun topic for this subreddit. I&#39;m keen to hear any feedback or alternative approaches you might suggest for this kind of problem!</p> <p>Source Code for the Ring Buffer: <a href="https://github.com/agilira/argus/blob/main/boreaslite.go">https://github.com/agilira/argus/blob/main/boreaslite.go</a></p> <p>Benchmarks: <a href="https://github.com/agilira/argus/tree/main/benchmarks">https://github.com/agilira/argus/tree/main/benchmarks</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Superb_Ad7467"> /u/Superb_Ad7467 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/agilira/argus">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7i34w/why_i_built_a_39m_ops_zeroallocation_ring_buffer/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I‚Äôm currently learning Go as a Python developer (I only have a few months of professional experience), mostly because I really enjoy the language and, who knows, maybe in the future I could transition into a Go-based role. Recently, I had an idea: how viable would it be to rebuild something like <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre">Calibre</a>.</p> <p>As a fantasy reader who loves both physical and digital books, I‚Äôve used Calibre many times in the past. For those who don‚Äôt know, Calibre is an e-book manager that allows you to view, convert, edit, and organize e-books in all major formats. While it‚Äôs powerful, I‚Äôve always found some parts of Calibre unintuitive or visually outdated. So, I thought: why not try to rebuild Calibre in Go?</p> <h1>My main goals would be to replicate core Calibre features like:</h1> <p>-Importing and organizing <code>.epub</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.mobi</code> files</p> <p>-Extracting and editing metadata</p> <p>-Converting between formats (e.g., EPUB ‚Üí PDF)</p> <p>-Sending books to Kindle via email or directly to Kindle</p> <p>-Searching books by title, author, tags, etc.</p> <p>-Downloading or reading from a browser</p> <p>But with some improvements like: Making it a web app (not a desktop app) so I can access it from any device, building a modern, visually pleasing UI that feels more like a personal digital library, not just a tool. And of course, taking advantage of the main features that Go offers.</p> <p>There are some challenges I have though about: </p> <p>-Calling <code>ebook-convert</code> (from Calibre) from Go using <code>os/exec</code>, since full conversion logic in Go would be hard to replicate</p> <p>-Handling file uploads, storage, and cleanup properly</p> <p>-Security concerns: users uploading files, running commands on the server</p> <p>-Lack of complete Go libraries (if I&#39;m mistaken please correct me) for parsing or generating <code>.epub</code>, <code>.mobi</code>, <code>.azw3</code></p> <p>So... is the idea viable? Is it to complex for now? Are there any technical dead-ends I should be aware of? Has anyone here tried something similar or seen something like this in the Go ecosystem?</p> <p>TL;DR:</p> <p>I&#39;m a Python Dev learning Go and thinking about rebuilding Calibre (e-book manager) as a web app in Go, same core features (organizing, converting, sending to Kindle), but with a modern UI and web access from any device..</p> <p>How viable is this project? Is it too ambitious / not worth the effort? Would love to hear your thoughts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YerayR14"> /u/YerayR14 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7gdtx/how_viable_is_to_build_a_modern_web_app/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7gdtx/how_viable_is_to_build_a_modern_web_app/">[comments]</a></span></div>

You can check out the repo here: <a href="https://github.com/confidentsecurity/go-nvtrust">https://github.com/confidentsecurity/go-nvtrust</a>. It&#39;s part of my work at Confident Security, a privacy-first AI inference company. </p> <p>What‚Äôs go-nvtrust?<br/> go-nvtrust is a Go package inspired by NVIDIA&#39;s nvtrust tool, providing a clean, native Go implementation for NVidia GPU attestation. It includes bindings for libnvidia-nscq. It supports Hopper (H100, H200) and Blackwell GPUs, making it straightforward to integrate hardware trust into your Go applications‚Äîespecially for secure AI inference or confidential computing setups. </p> <p>Why does this exist?<br/> We needed a Go-native library rather than NVIDIA&#39;s nvtrust. The tool then allows us to verify the GPU is authentic, untampered, and in confidential mode. </p> <p>Key Features<br/> We designed go-nvtrust with simplicity and flexibility in mind, building on NVIDIA&#39;s foundations:<br/> - Go bindings for libnvidia-nscq to handle NVSwitch attestation.<br/> - Integration with go-nvml for seamless GPU evidence collection.<br/> - A straightforward API for NRAS remote verification and end-to-end confidential computing workflows. </p> <p>Other features include:<br/> - Support for tamper-proof evidence handling in distributed systems.<br/> - Apache-2.0 license for easy adoption and contributions.<br/> - Quick-start examples and API reference in the README. </p> <p>Cheers,<br/> Vadim</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yoihito"> /u/yoihito </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7f7lm/opensourcing_gonvtrust_a_go_library_for_nvidia/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o7f7lm/opensourcing_gonvtrust_a_go_library_for_nvidia/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I made a mistake about memory usage and need to fix it.</p> <p><strong>The Mistake</strong></p> <p>The QJS README included a benchmark claiming &quot;QJS uses 94.30x less memory than Goja.&quot; This was wrong.</p> <p><strong>What Happened</strong></p> <p>The memory numbers measured different things:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Goja</strong> uses Go&#39;s heap. Go tracks this and reports ~90MB allocated during the test. Average usage was ~1.5MB.</li> <li><strong>QJS</strong> uses WebAssembly memory. Go cannot see this memory. QJS uses ~1MB.</li> </ul> <p>I compared Goja&#39;s total allocations (~90MB) with QJS&#39;s actual usage (1MB). This was not fair.</p> <p><strong>The Real Difference</strong></p> <p>Goja and QJS handle memory differently:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Goja</strong> creates many Go objects.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a server-side rendering library for Go that focuses on <strong>type-safe templates</strong>, <strong>component composition</strong>, and <strong>zero-runtime deployment</strong>.</p> <p>I predominantly work with Nextjs and some frustrations always arise here there and I think &quot;I wish I could do this with Go&quot;. So this is for me first. But I enjoy the developer experience and wanted to share it with you people. </p> <p>With this library, you can write your templates in Go, get full IDE support, reuse components, and see changes instantly with hot reload. When you&#39;re ready to ship, everything compiles down to a single binary.</p> <p>A few highlights:</p> <p>- Type-safe, composable templates </p> <p>- Instant hot reload during development (with air)</p> <p>- One-binary deployment, everything is embedded (although configurable)</p> <p>- Partial pre-rendering, middleware support, opt-in caching, streaming async chunks and more</p> <p>I wanted it to feel modern (component-based) without leaving Go‚Äôs ecosystem. I intend to create a simple, accessible component library with it as well (There is some work done but I have not documented it yet).</p> <p>The docs are lacking at the moment but I&#39;ve managed to create a &quot;Getting Started&quot; section so maybe it could give you an idea. The doc site is built using Pacis as well.</p> <p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/canpacis/pacis">github.com/canpacis/pacis</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href="https://ui.canpacis.com/">Pacis Docs</a></p> <p>Would love feedback from both Go devs and web folks, especially around API design, ergonomics, and edge cases. </p> <p>If you‚Äôve built anything similar, I‚Äôd love to compare notes too!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/can_pacis"> /u/can_pacis </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://ui.canpacis.com/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o75vub/ive_been_developing_a_go_ssr_library/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Many people tend to prefer simplicity and move to big game engines like Godot or Unity, but a minority here prefers to use frameworks instead.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been writing and updating my own framework for Go and released it a couple of month ago. It&#39;s very similar to LibGDX and it&#39;s really lightweight and performant, maybe some of you would like to try it out or build some amazing stuff with it.</p> <p>It&#39;s FOSS and really intuitive to use as it doesn&#39;t force you into a specific architecture.</p> <p>I&#39;ve published a couple of articles on my blog about it, give us a read if you&#39;re interested and also some brutally honest feedback!</p> <p>It&#39;s called <strong>Forge</strong></p> <p>Here&#39;s the forum: <a href="https://forgeleaf.com/">https://forgeleaf.com/</a></p> <p>And the framework website is here: <a href="https://forgeleaf.com/forge">https://forgeleaf.com/forge</a></p> <p>If you want to see the code, here&#39;s the repo: <a href="https://github.com/ForgeLeaf/Forge">https://github.com/ForgeLeaf/Forge</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/templi_dev"> /u/templi_dev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o6sv8s/an_unopinionated_game_framework_for_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o6sv8s/an_unopinionated_game_framework_for_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>
