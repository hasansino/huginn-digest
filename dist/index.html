It&#39;s a single, self-contained binary that&#39;s about 22x faster and passes the original&#39;s test suite. It works as both a CLI tool and as a library in your Rust projects.</p> <p>repo: <a href="https://github.com/fulm-o/uroman-rs">https://github.com/fulm-o/uroman-rs</a></p> <p>Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what makes it different: - It&#39;s a single binary. You don&#39;t need to worry about having a Python runtime installed to use it. - It&#39;s a drop-in replacement. Since it passes the original test suite, you can swap it into your existing workflows and get the same output. - It&#39;s fast. The ~22x speedup is a huge advantage when you&#39;re processing large files or datasets.</p> <p>Hope you find it useful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fulmlumo"> /u/fulmlumo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mitfxj/i_created_uromanrs_a_22x_faster_rewrite_of_uroman/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mitfxj/i_created_uromanrs_a_22x_faster_rewrite_of_uroman/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I&#39;ve been conducting a Rust project for a couple of months now, and I&#39;m looking for at least 1 other dev to share the journey with. Someone who will be decently involved, so they can take decisions and really make things move forward with me!</p> <p>The project is for the community, there is no money involved and it seems quite complicated to find someone motivated online. I already posted on specific communities about the project, which got some attention, nice feedback, etc, but I still end up mostly alone on it... The project got a lot of great comments and hope from others, which is very motivating though!</p> <p>What are your suggestions to find such a person ?!</p> <p>------</p> <p>Here is the project for the curious ones: <a href="https://github.com/Arcadia-Solutions/arcadia">https://github.com/Arcadia-Solutions/arcadia</a></p> <p>Arcadia is a site and tracker for the bittorrent protocol. The goal is to provide a near-to-perfect experience in terms of organization for any kind of media. <strong>In simple words</strong>, you want a movie/game/book/etc, Arcadia will display all of its editions/formats/versions in a comprehensive way, together with all its metadata (description, artists, pictures, etc.). Alongside, will come an api to automate anything you want (uploading, downloading, etc). The community will be at the center of the site, with forums/collages/comments/events/bonuses/etc. This will be the ultimate place for media preservation and archiving!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AntonioKarot"> /u/AntonioKarot </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mia7jz/finding_contributors_for_an_opensource_project/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mia7jz/finding_contributors_for_an_opensource_project/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Full source and pre-compiled binaries for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (x86, untested <sup><sup><sup>but</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>probably</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>fine?</sup></sup></sup> !) at: <a href="https://github.com/nullstalgia/yap">https://github.com/nullstalgia/yap</a></p> <hr/> <p>I don&#39;t wish to rattle off a whole bulletpoint of features since that&#39;s what a README is for, so I instead want to share some of the reasons for <em>why</em> I&#39;ve spent the first half of this year refining this so much.</p> <p>First off, if you&#39;re a diehard fan for minicom/picocom, this probably isn&#39;t going to replace that for you, and that&#39;s fine! </p> <p>But if you&#39;re more like me, and just need to occasionally <code>yap</code> at a serial device without wanting to remember multi-key combos for simple actions like changing Baud Rate, or have to work with a device that has a nasty habit of disconnecting, then I hope this tool works as well for you as it has for me! </p> <p>The main thing thing I was needing was a reliable daily-driver serial console for embedded (often ESP32) development. Espressif&#39;s chips are most often flashed using their UART Serial interface, which is the same interface your firmware will primarily use to output logs. This brings a similar problem to exclusive (mutable) references in Rust, the connection to the serial port can only be owned by your flashing tool <strong>or</strong> your serial debug tool, <em>but never both</em>. So I thought, &quot;why not combine them?&quot; </p> <p>Another personal frustration I harbored for a long time is that very few decent <em>cross-platform</em> options existed. CuteCom served me well on my Linux desktop, but didn&#39;t have a Windows build. Termite is a decent Windows option with a plugin system, but froze frequently and didn&#39;t exist for Linux. </p> <p>And if you&#39;ve spent any meaningful amount of time with serial ports (on either operating system!), you&#39;ll be well aware of their tendency to occasionally change their name/path when re-enumerating (if the USB interface restarts or if you had to physically unplug and replug the device), especially if the previous path is still bound to by your serial console. Every other app I&#39;ve tried takes the na√Øve approach of trying to reconnect to the previous port name. I try to tackle this with a more sophisticated auto-reconnect scheme, by looking for devices that match <em>characteristics</em> of the suddenly-disconnected device, with a configurable level of strictness. (When in the less-strict mode, <code>yap</code> absolutely shines as a provisioning tool by chaining an ESP Flash operation and several macros onto a single keybind after automatically connecting to the new port!)</p> <p>An added bonus for me came from making this a TUI-first app, since now I can more comfortably interact with <strong>remote serial devices over SSH!</strong> <sup><sup><sup>Well,</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>mini/picocom</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>beat</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>me</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>to</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>that,</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>but</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>I&#39;m</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>still</sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup>pleased.</sup></sup></sup> And with all the creature-comforts I&#39;d expect from running it locally.

For about a year, I&#39;ve been working on an IDE for Android (that runs on Android locally). By IDE, I truly mean an integrated development environment, one that offers features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, diagnostics, signature help, go-to definition, declaration, implementation, show documentation, and more.</p> <p>Currently, it&#39;s for the Rust programming language. I chose Rust because it&#39;s consistently one of the most admired languages in the annual Stack Overflow surveys.</p> <p>A lot of the code in the IDE is shared, so it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to adapt it for other languages in the future.</p> <p>The IDE allows the user to export APKs for graphical applications and games and also lets them run the app quickly without having to install it. The app actually uses a strange dynamic loading technique to load itself from the shared library it generates from your code.</p> <p>I&#39;ve created a website for the app where I detail its features: <a href="https://rustroid.is-a.dev">https://rustroid.is-a.dev</a></p> <p>And I wrote about why and how I created the app in this article: <a href="https://rustroid.is-a.dev/story">https://rustroid.is-a.dev/story</a></p> <p>The application is available on Google Play.</p> <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedkhc.ide.rust">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mohammedkhc.ide.rust</a></p> <p>And yeah that&#39;s it.</p> <p>Disclaimer: The application is not open source and/or free.<br/> I explained why is that in detail in <a href="https://rustroid.is-a.dev/story#publishing-the-app">https://rustroid.is-a.dev/story#publishing-the-app</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Mouse_8237"> /u/Ok_Mouse_8237 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mi6al0/how_did_i_write_rustroid_a_rust_ide_that_runs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mi6al0/how_did_i_write_rustroid_a_rust_ide_that_runs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But even though I would love to vent, instead I want to focus on something positive to get my mood up and get rid of some of the frustration. And the positive thing I chose to focus on is the <em>lack of frustration</em> I have with Golang. So let&#39;s start the positivity train, shall we? (This is going to be a long one)</p> <h1>The Community</h1> <p>My god do I love the go community. Not only is the community super active and helpful, but it also cares for the language and creates so much content. So much content. In all forms. YouTube videos, libraries, Blog-Posts, Reddit-Posts and comments, StackOverflow. It&#39;s so easy finding solutions to problems one might have. </p> <p>And the community also actively takes part in developing this language and making it better. Creating proposals including implementation details, concepts, even going as far as creating forks of the GoLang repo with the proposal being implemented. My god, do I love you people. </p> <h1>The simplicity</h1> <p>No unnecessary syntax sugar, no short cuts that might make writing something easier/faster but reading the code harder and more complex. If something was decided to be done one way in the language or even in its standard libraries changing that way is not done on a whim. Careful considerations are being made, and if the way of doing something changes, even if it is just &quot;where do I find function x in the standard library&quot; major steps are being taken to make sure people know about the change. </p> <p>And while it&#39;s not always perfect, I&#39;ve never stumbled into a situation in GoLang where I found something online, implemented it and than hours, days or weeks down the road found out &quot;actually, that&#39;s the old way of doing things. You should actually do it this way now&quot;. In the few instances where I found out there are multiple ways to do something, it was usually &quot;yeah, you can do it like this or like that, but you decide what fits best for you. Here are the pros and cons&quot; or I found out the outdated way is wrong by reading the always present documentation. Which leads me to my next point.</p> <h1>Documentation</h1> <p>Wow do I love the GoLang documentation. It&#39;s far from perfect and in some ways other languages do it better, but holy smokes. The fact documentation is auto generated no matter what? The fact writing doc comments is so easy? The fact that no matter what editor I&#39;m using I always have quick access to docs in my editor? The fact the auto generated documentation online is easily searchable? Sometimes it seems like the autogenerated docs makes people lazy and think they don&#39;t need to write actual documentation and then I&#39;m reminded by other languages that...nope, most of these people wouldn&#39;t have bothered unless their project gains some kind of traction, and even then the documentation might be abysmal with &quot;This might be out of date&quot; plastered everywhere. I&#39;d take an &quot;empty&quot; GoLang documentation consisting of just the packages exposed components over these kind of docs any day. At least the auto-docs can&#39;t feed me wrong and outdated information about the package I&#39;m using.</p> <h1>Standard Library</h1> <p>I know &quot;the standard library is enough&quot; has become a meme but man do I appreciate that this is almost entirely true and that in most cases, using a 3rd party package is MY decision and MY decision alone. There are <em>some</em> recommendations by the GoLang Devs and there are cases where you either spent a lot of work re-inventing the wheel or just use a 3rd party library but mostly? Go and its standard libraries stand by themselves and it&#39;s easy to find ways to do something without external libraries and I don&#39;t need (nor get recommended) to use 3rd party packages unless I actually need to and would gain something from them instead of the GoLang Devs and community relying on 3rd party packages to provide basic features.</p> <h1>Right amount of opinionation, conventions and freedom</h1> <p>GoLang enforces good standards and practices while also giving me freedom at all the right places. No wars over meaningless stuff and no headache about &quot;but this restriction makes this fairly trivial, easy thing more complicated than it needs to be!&quot;</p> <h1>3rd Party packages</h1> <p>In the cases I do need 3rd party packages, GoLang (or its community) is also so amazing. It&#39;s often the perfect amount of variance and community-standards. There aren&#39;t 50 libraries that all try to solve the same problem, but also no &quot;this is our holy grail that you should use and we are also assuming you will use it and base everything else on you using this exact package!&quot;. Nope. Here you have a handful of popular packages. Here are the advantages and disadvantages of each. And none of these try to solve 20 different problems at the same time, instead there might be packages that have been designed to integrate quick and easy with another package to solve multiple problems, but if you don&#39;t want to use any of these? You don&#39;t need to. We even try to prevent tight coupling and will create common interfaces to make switching 3rd party packages or integrating them at a later point easy and almost a &quot;drop in&quot; replacement. </p> <p>Ah, I already feel better. I think this was much better than just venting and there is also no risk of getting backlash for being frustrated. I would love to hear what you like when it comes to GoLang and the community. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lofter1"> /u/Lofter1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mikjjc/golang_appreciation_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mikjjc/golang_appreciation_post/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been learning Go for the last couple of weeks. Today I tried to start learning go-gl. I started by simply creating a new project, following the <a href="https://github.com/go-gl/glfw">glfw</a> instructions and sample code. After hours of troubleshooting an issue where the v3.3 wasn&#39;t being recognized, I finally got it working only to try and run the code and get windows defender telling me it was blocked because of a Win64/LummaStealer trojan. Is this a false positive as some searching indicates? If so, is there a way to mitigate Windows Defender from blocking it? I tried to make exceptions for my user go and project files Go directories as well as my dev folders, but it continues to throw the flag. Running a scan just in case.
