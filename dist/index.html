            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear all,</p> <p>About a month ago I released my library <a href="https://docs.rs/lfqueue/latest/lfqueue/">lfqueue</a>, which is a fast concurrent lock-free queue. Since then I received lots of great feedback, and while I have not yet been able to address it all, I have received a new update with improvements and some functionality improvements.</p> <p>This library was created with the purpose of creating executor agnostic fast async signaling primitives, sort of like what you get with Tokio&#39;s Notify-- but without the overhead of bringing in the entirety of tokio and not dealing with locks. Additionally, there is a <code>!Send</code> and <code>!Sync</code> version which is designed to work with local executors and thread-per-core designs.</p> <p>The crate has been named <a href="https://github.com/DiscordJim/asyncnal">asyncnal</a> and does exactly this. I would be very grateful for any feedback, and please let me know if this helps with your projects or if it could be improved in any way to fit your use-case better!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Terikashi"> /u/Terikashi </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhw9e7/executor_agnostic_asynchronous_signalling/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhw9e7/executor_agnostic_asynchronous_signalling/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>Wanted to share an ML tool my brother and I have been working on for the past two months: <a href="https://github.com/getlilac/lilac">https://github.com/getlilac/lilac</a></p> <p>Lilac connects compute from any cloud and lets you easily submit training jobs to queues -- which get intelligently allocated to the most appropriate node. We also built a simple UI for you to keep track of your jobs, nodes, and queues.</p> <p>Current alternatives are either fully based off of Kubernetes making setup complicated for smaller teams -- or utilize individual private keys per data engineer to connect to multiple clouds which isn&#39;t very scalable or secure.</p> <p>Instead, Lilac uses a lightweight Rust agent that you can run on any node with a single <code>docker run</code> command. The agent polls for jobs, so you don&#39;t have to expose your compute nodes to the internet, making the whole setup way simpler and more secure.</p> <p>We just open-sourced and released <code>v0.1.0</code> . The project is still super early, and we&#39;d love to get your feedback, criticism, and ideas.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/luew2"> /u/luew2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhp4hm/created_an_opensource_tool_to_help_you_find_gpus/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhp4hm/created_an_opensource_tool_to_help_you_find_gpus/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to announce the next project we&#39;ve been working on lately: an LLM inference engine based on Burn! The goal of Burn-LM is actually bigger than that: we want to support any large model, LLM, VLM, and others, not only for inference but also for training (pre-training, post-training, and fine-tuning).</p> <p>All of those things, running on any device, powered by Rust, Burn and CubeCL. If you want more information about why we&#39;re making such a project, you can look at our blog post here: <a href="https://burn.dev/blog/burn-lm-announcement/">https://burn.dev/blog/burn-lm-announcement/</a></p> <p>A demo is worth a thousand words, so here&#39;s what burn-lm is able to do today: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9huhAcz7p8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9huhAcz7p8</a></p> <p>As the goal of Burn-LM includes portability, it works across most supported Burn backends: ndarray, webgpu, metal, vulkan, cuda, rocm/hip and libtorch.</p> <p><strong>Why Another LLM Inference Engine?</strong></p> <p>Most inference engines, as their name suggests, are not designed to support training as their primary goal. As mentioned at the beginning, this is not the case for Burn-LM. We don&#39;t want to include hardware-specific or model-specific optimizations directly in Burn-LM. Instead, we aim to find generalizable solutions that work across all hardware and models, implementing those optimizations directly in Burn to benefit everyone using it for any kind of model. In other words, all optimizations made for Burn-LM are funneled back into Burn and CubeCL, so even if you don&#39;t use the project, it should bring performance improvements to many models built with Burn - no code changes required.</p> <p>Don&#39;t hesitate to test it on your computer and share any issues you encounter. There may be some lag the first time a model is used due to our JIT compiler and autotune, but their state is serialized to disk for later use. The UX is not yet satisfactory, it would be great to have a proper tuning/compiling phase when loading a model, but hey, it&#39;s alpha!</p> <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-lm">https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-lm</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ksyiros"> /u/ksyiros </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhn1wz/announcing_burnlm_alpha_llm_inference_engine/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mhn1wz/announcing_burnlm_alpha_llm_inference_engine/">[comments]</a></span></div>

But I&#39;ve probed the community a couple of times by leaving some posts I considered on-the-edge up and seen them get hit with reports and impolite, if accurate, comments about AI usage, so if anything the removal rate is still on the low side for the community.</p> <p>What I&#39;ve noticed is that it isn&#39;t really &quot;AI usage&quot; that is the problem. What is the problem is that it&#39;s just too easy to make a small little project now, one that was notable by 2020 standards but in 2025 isn&#39;t anymore. Even if the author didn&#39;t use AI to generate the 30th caching library for Go this year it still frustrates the community to see it, regardless of where it came from. It is the flood of these that is breaking the balance.</p> <p>I would like to propose a middle ground to the community - a weekly &quot;Small Projects&quot; thread that people can populate. I can remove their top-level post with a request that they post it there instead. Then, at the end of the week, as I rotate the new pinned post in, I will put up a normal post pointing at the previous one, which will be a completely normal post, not pinned, just a normal post the community can vote on as usual. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/wiki/project_requirements/">notability standards</a> would be rewritten into &quot;what goes into the Small Projects thread&quot; rather than what gets removed. This thread would basically be no-holds-barred with regard to AI in the code, and rather than hard-banning AI summarization, on the poster&#39;s head rest it if they want to write their small project summary in the default LLM voice.</p> <p>This can give a place to do weekly scans for those who are interested, give a place for at least <em>some</em> exposure to those projects (including those I&#39;ve had to remove in the past few weeks), and make the mods less sad about just removing things. And if you don&#39;t want to see it, don&#39;t click through.</p> <p>Also in the interests of not having too many meta posts, all discussion about AI, how you feel it&#39;s going, and how you&#39;d like it to go is on topic here, related to the subreddit or just related to Go in general.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jerf"> /u/jerf </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mhefic/meta_small_projects_weekly_thread/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mhefic/meta_small_projects_weekly_thread/">[comments]</a></span></div>

So whenever we add a new process, we just create a new implementation‚Äîsimple and clean.</p> <p>But now the client wants a fully autonomous no-code BP builder, ideally with minimal code changes. Basically, they want to configure and build business workflows via UI without touching the codebase.</p> <p>We‚Äôre using Go. Are there any existing workflow engines in Go that support this kind of use case? Camunda was considered but got rejected‚Äîtoo complex, BPMN is overkill for them.

If you haven&#39;t heard about them before or have forgotten, a few years ago, Jepsen (<a href="https://jepsen.io/">https://jepsen.io/</a>) together with Fly.io did put up these challenges, including creating a Go library to use. Where the different challenges are run on a very cool distributed systems workbench.</p> <p>Even if time have passed, I think it is worth to bring this up again since it is timeless and a great study. It is very little overhead since it is a simulator, so you can focus on distributed systems aspects.</p> <p>I have never used Go in my day job, and used this resource also to practice and play around with the language. You can find my solutions at <a href="https://github.com/tobiajo/gossip-gloomers">https://github.com/tobiajo/gossip-gloomers</a>, I would love to discuss approaches.</p> <p><strong>Tips</strong></p> <p>Just follow the &quot;Let&#39;s Get Started&quot; for the initial warm-up challenge. In later exercises I took inspiration from my university text book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Reliable-Secure-Distributed-Programming-ebook/dp/B008R61LBG">https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Reliable-Secure-Distributed-Programming-ebook/dp/B008R61LBG</a>, especially on broadcasting which by the way have many valid approaches. That book is not needed, but read up on concepts like total order broadcast and consistency models to get out more of the challenges for yourself.</p> <p>A useful strategy for several challenges is to use &quot;cluster sharding&quot; with a single writer per data partition. Like consistent hashing if you have heard of it, just dividing the data so that one node is responsible for a fixed subset of keys. Also, in the end, the key-value stores&#39; compare-and-swap (CAS) can be used to implement optimistic transactions.</p> <p>Unfortunately in the last challenges #6b and #6c, the suggested consistency models to test against, Read Uncommitted and Read Committed are broken and <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/issues/56#issuecomment-1615170458">allows garbage reads</a>. Instead I suggest to do &quot;#6x&quot; as me without the <code>--consistency-models</code> flag which gives the default Serializable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PragmaticFive"> /u/PragmaticFive </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mh6tu1/flyio_distributed_systems_challenge_solutions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mh6tu1/flyio_distributed_systems_challenge_solutions/">[comments]</a></span></div>
