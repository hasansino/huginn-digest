            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First off, I&#39;m an engineer that did a lot of work on scaling, and in recent years, open source. I published <a href="https://github.com/titpetric/etl">https://github.com/titpetric/etl</a> months if not years before I picked up AI for the first time. I wrote a lot of code in various runtimes and business domains but use Go exclusively for many years now. For anything.</p> <p>My recent obsession with AI (in a measured way, unlike my obsession with coffee), lead me down a chain of writing supportive tooling like a template engine that works with hot-loading, follows Vue syntax and let&#39;s me do back end templating in a familiar style. Convenience is king, and for me, convenience only means the go runtime, none of this node/npm ecosystem chaos, no scaling issues, and no needing to patch language syntax. If I had written it a few years ago, I wouldn&#39;t have fs.FS, or generics, or iterators, and really the only concerns go code is left with is optimizing software design to new abstractions.</p> <p>I implemented etl as a simple CLI, which grew into a server, where you would with a yaml configuration define a full API for your service, directly implementing the api with SQL. I added sqlite, mysql, and postgres, considering user choice. It enabled creating REST style APIs like /api/users/{id}, and spitting out the SELECT statement result as the response json.</p> <p>Now I realize this is where AI accelerated me somewhat ; I added an additional handler that is able to invoke the API endpoint returning json and feed it to the template, which can now be defined in the yaml config. Additionally I asked for a rate limiter, defined the data models, extended tests, along my overlay of design, architectural and testing concerns. Software is never perfect, but iterative.</p> <p>Why do you care? Well, here is where it gets interesting. Using sqlite I can simplify my database management (no connection pools and other limitations), meaning I&#39;m only limited by disk and I can set very predictable quotas.</p> <p>50mb per would partition a 500gb so many times that a single server could handle thousands of users.</p> <p>Using the .yml gives me a sandboxed but unified execution environment, memory wise it can live even on a low memory instance serving tens of thousands of requests per second.</p> <p>So my main problem is, is the SQL in yaml approach expressive enough? Can it build large composable systems? For this, I need testers. I can build and design apps on my own, and use this in process, sure, but the true step forward is someone that wants to do something with data. The more someone&#39;s I have, I can see how this scales with real use with various applications that you could choose to model with SQL.</p> <p>What&#39;s in it for you? I can partition some cloud resources that give you an always on API that&#39;s driven by an sqlite database. You could have a dashboard that queries data from sqlite, renders to JSON or HTML, has cached responses and configurable rate limits.</p> <p>What&#39;s in it for me? I obviously don&#39;t care about market validation, more about the process. In the past I&#39;ve relied too much on php, node and even go to implement APIs, always sort of falling back on the same operational problems. That being said, a PaaS that&#39;s cost effective to run for this setup mainly needs to account for data durability, the traffic itself is an &quot;add more nodes&quot; problem. Since it&#39;s a shared runtime environment the number of running processes per server is 1, per any amount of users. I love it.</p> <p>It&#39;s kind of hosting, but it&#39;s really lightweight, so don&#39;t think there&#39;s a cutoff ; 10gb of storage is 50mb x 200, so lets make it anywhere from 200-500 users. Not to be bill gates and say 50mb is enough for everyone, but I can bump the quota, the only thing I can&#39;t support is <em>endless growth</em>, at which point we have a discussion.</p> <p>The limiting factor is cpu. Cpu I suspect will be most used if you&#39;re doing statistics or querying the service without caching or limits. As you can configure those, not much concern it left.</p> <p>Anyone willing to help in any way is welcome to reach out to <a href="mailto:me@titpetric.com">me@titpetric.com</a>, put ETL in the subject, like &quot;I&#39;d like an ETL server shard&quot;.</p> <p>Don&#39;t expect an immediate response, but if you include some detail as to what you&#39;d use it for, it may get your onboarding fast tracked. Of course, you can build the docker image and start in your homelab, file any github issues, PRs.</p> <p>Thank you for consideration. I&#39;m really discovering the use cases and limitations here, and figuring that out is a people problem. I need people to poke holes in the design, point out edge cases.</p> <p>Disclaimer: the project is OSS, the server is self hosting, written in Go, and I&#39;d like to share this much as Linus Torvalds would (free as in beer).</p> <p>I would add an AI policy, but other than &quot;I trust it as far as I can throw it&quot; the nuances of working with AI in my case only equate to my own dominion over it&#39;s output, it&#39;s not a shortcut for thinking things through. We both make errors. I lean into linting and detailed testing with test fixtures to mitigate regession, as I would for my own code. I favour composition. I haven&#39;t seen a policy on AI use much as I haven&#39;t seen policies for working with other devs, but I imagine they would be about the same. I&#39;m having the same corrective reviews either way, that&#39;s what you get from the average distribution of model training data.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/titpetric"> /u/titpetric </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgstz8/testers_wanted_for_an_etl_sqlite_based_paas_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgstz8/testers_wanted_for_an_etl_sqlite_based_paas_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The list I came up with: * Invoke <code>os/exec</code> and read stdout (ex. implemented in link) * Use the go <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/plugin">plugin</a> package (seems very finicky with pitfalls and I might code myself into a dead end) * Web Assembly (haven&#39;t done a ton of research but seems like a mix between plugin and exec?) * Separate Service/API: the most work on the downstream users</p> <p>I&#39;m focusing on the data source question at the moment, which means whatever solution I choose will be running once every 6 hours, or something similar. Rather than on every request from the base server.</p> <p>So I&#39;ve got a few questions to sort through: * Any additional architectures/ideas I missed? * How bad of a practice is the <code>os/exec</code> solution in this case? * Is the Go plugin solution simplified a ton by building on the server&#39;s docker image? (Maybe I&#39;d need to pass build args for plugin building, but otherwise it would be the same?) * Expose a server API for dev&#39;s to push events into the server.</p> <p>I&#39;m leaning towards the <code>os/exec</code> solution as it seems easiest to implement, and is also the most flexible in terms of allowing downstream devs to use python, etc. to write their data sources.</p> <p><em>Edit:</em> I&#39;m more focused on the plugin/extending the server with downstream dev&#39;s code than I am on the calendar aspect. </p> <p>CalDAV and JMAP are good notes though for the calendar aspect.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy_Manufacturer_6"> /u/Heavy_Manufacturer_6 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgmjbc/downstream_app_extensions_plugin_exec_services/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgmjbc/downstream_app_extensions_plugin_exec_services/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m remaking balatro for the terminal, just as a little sideproject/thinking exercise and one thing i&#39;m not super happy with how it&#39;s turning out is that all the functionality is in the same package (like 12 files: card.go, joker.go, hand.go, shop_state.go, etc), and every time i try to do something about it i get cyclical dependency errors and just leave like it was before. It&#39;s all just so interconnected because the GameState needs to interact with many different things, but these things also have effects based on the game or directly affect certain stats like adding cards to the deck and so on.</p> <p>I&#39;ll give a concrete example. I have the GameState i mentioned which basically has the relevant info for every game aspect, like the current deck, jokers, number of hands/discards and whatnot.</p> <p>And on the other hand Jokers are defined like so:</p> <pre><code>type Joker struct { Type JokerType Edition Edition Enhancement Enhancement } type JokerType struct { Effects []JokerEffect Rarity Rarity name string help string } type JokerFunc func(game *GameState, round *RoundState, hand Hand, cardIdx int, leftOverCards []Card) (Sum, Multiplier) type JokerPassive func(*GameState, *RoundState) type JokerEffect struct { effect JokerFunc undoEffect JokerPassive timing JokerTiming } </code></pre> <p>You know, a little convoluted i know but i didn&#39;t want to make an interface and implement it by creating a new struct for each joker, i just create it with NewJoker() and pass all the stuff it needs yadda yadda. JokerType is basically what the effect is, and Joker is the individual joker card that is in play in a game. </p> <p>Anyway, the point is, i was thinking of putting these two structs into different packages, for organization&#39;s sake, make a little tidier. However GameState depends on Joker and Joker depends on GameState, since some of the have effects depend on the state. So if i put them in different packages i get the dependency cycle problem i mentioned previously.</p> <p>So basically two questions: 1. how would you go about solving this? And 2. should i even bother if it works as is?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fucking_idiot2"> /u/fucking_idiot2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgi11z/how_do_i_avoid_putting_everything_into_one/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1pgi11z/how_do_i_avoid_putting_everything_into_one/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The template flavour is similar to the usual <code>format!</code> syntax, but generic over parsing rules of the <code>{contents}</code>. I have paid particular attention to the &quot;compile-once render-many&quot; use-case, for example when formatting structured log data according to a user-provided template.</p> <p>This library is the result of my desire to find a middle ground between heavy DSLs (like <a href="https://docs.rs/tera">tera</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/handlebars">handlebars</a>) and the compiler built-in <code>format!</code>.</p> <p>In particular, this is <em>not a fully-featured templating library</em>: there is no control flow, conditionals, looping, etc. built-in (the API allows this via stateful rendering, but it would be quite a bit of work to implement). On the other hand, it is <em>not tied to a specific formatting syntax</em> (like <code>format!</code> if it worked at runtime).</p> <p>The μfmt API is designed around the following flow:</p> <ol> <li>A user provides a template, which is then compiled into an intermediate representation.</li> <li>The compiled template is rendered against backing data.</li> </ol> <p>The dividing point between (1) and (2) is intentionally flexible (i.e. unspecified).</p> <p>To give a concrete example, suppose the backing data is a <code>Vec</code>. Then the intermediate representation should be a <code>usize</code>. An accepted template would look like <code>Index {0} and {1}</code>. A template like <code>{invalid}</code> or <code>{-1}</code> would be rejected at template compile-time; the compiled template will contain the valid <code>usize</code> indices.</p> <p>When rendering, however, the index might be invalid for the specific <code>Vec</code>, resulting in a failure in step (2).</p> <p>On the other hand, if you know exactly how long the <code>Vec</code> will be up-front, you can modify the intermediate representation to only accept indices which land in the valid range. Then, step (2) will never produce an error.</p> <p>The library uses an <code>Ast</code> trait for the intermediate representation, and a <code>Manifest</code> trait for backing data. A number of <a href="https://docs.rs/mufmt/latest/mufmt/types/index.html">built-in implementations</a> are provided for common use-cases (like data stored in a <code>(BTree|Hash)Map</code>, <code>Vec</code>; expression types which are <code>FromStr;</code> etc.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sbcrlmaed"> /u/sbcrlmaed </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pgxpsg/μfmt_yet_another_runtime_formatting_library/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pgxpsg/μfmt_yet_another_runtime_formatting_library/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few months ago I started building my own programming language called OtterLang. I wanted something that felt Pythonic but still compiled to real native binaries through LLVM. I didn’t expect it to completely take over my life.</p> <p>Being a developer on this has been rough. Some days everything just works, and other days a missing colon makes me want to rewrite the entire compiler from scratch.</p> <p>Getting consistent builds across Windows, macOS, and Linux was brutal. Even a tiny linker version mismatch could break everything for days.</p> <p>The FFI system has been the hardest but most interesting part. I’ve been working on a transparent Rust FFI so you can import and call Rust crates directly from OtterLang. It technically works, but it’s not perfect — macros and proc-macros are ignored, and structs or enums just cross the boundary as opaque handles for now. Still, it’s been pretty amazing seeing Rust functions appear automatically inside the language, even if it’s still bare-bones.</p> <p>Motivation has been the hardest part overall. Working on a compiler alone gets lonely fast. But recently a few contributors joined in, and it’s honestly made a huge difference. Seeing others care about the same vision keeps me going.</p> <p>OtterLang is still early and full of rough edges, but it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever built. I’ve learned more about compilers, memory, and design trade-offs from this than any course could ever teach me.</p> <p>I’m hoping to have the first public release ready in the next month or two. If you’ve ever worked on a language or runtime before, I’d love to hear what your biggest challenges were.</p> <p>if you would like to check out the repo or contribute feel free! (and if you like it a star maybe)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Small-Permission7909"> /u/Small-Permission7909 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/Ottrlang/otterlang">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1pgkew7/problems_ive_had_coding_my_own_programming/">[comments]</a></span></div>
