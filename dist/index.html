<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about <a href="/blog/json">support for JSON in Go</a>,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.</p>
<p>Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and <code>encoding/json</code> is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25‚Äôs new
experimental <code>encoding/json/v2</code> and <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-encodingjson">Problems with <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>Overall, <code>encoding/json</code> has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-flaws">Behavior flaws</h3>
<p>There are various behavioral flaws in <code>encoding/json</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imprecise handling of JSON syntax</strong>: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE&amp;t=1057s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">exploited by attackers in security applications</a>
and has been exploited before (as in <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12635" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CVE-2017-12635</a>).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaking nilness of slices and maps</strong>: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow <code>null</code> to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since <code>encoding/json</code> marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON <code>null</code>,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
<a href="/issue/63397#discussioncomment-7201222">A survey</a>
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-insensitive unmarshaling</strong>: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inconsistent calling of methods</strong>: Due to an implementation detail,
<code>MarshalJSON</code> methods declared on a pointer receiver
are <a href="/issue/22967">inconsistently called by <code>encoding/json</code></a>. While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-deficiencies">API deficiencies</h3>
<p>The API of <code>encoding/json</code> can be tricky or restrictive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an <code>io.Reader</code>.
Users often write <code>json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v)</code>,
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options can be set on the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types,
but cannot be used with the <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions.
Similarly, types implementing the <code>Marshaler</code> and <code>Unmarshaler</code> interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the <code>Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields</code> option loses its effect
when calling a custom <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Compact</code>, <code>Indent</code>, and <code>HTMLEscape</code> functions write to a <code>bytes.Buffer</code>
instead of something more flexible like a <code>[]byte</code> or <code>io.Writer</code>.
This limits the usability of those functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance-limitations">Performance limitations</h3>
<p>Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>MarshalJSON</code> interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned <code>[]byte</code>. Also, the semantics require that
<code>encoding/json</code> verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UnmarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces <code>encoding/json</code> to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>.
Afterwards, the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of streaming</strong>: Even though the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types operate
on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The <code>Decoder.Token</code> method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, if the implementation of a <code>MarshalJSON</code> or <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method
recursively calls the <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-fix-encodingjson-directly">Trying to fix <code>encoding/json</code> directly</h2>
<p>Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the <a href="/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>.</p>
<p>We could in principle declare separate names, such as <code>MarshalV2</code> or <code>UnmarshalV2</code>,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to <code>encoding/json/v2</code> (henceforth called <code>v2</code>),
where we can make these changes within a separate <code>v2</code> namespace
in contrast to <code>encoding/json</code> (henceforth called <code>v1</code>).</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-encodingjsonv2">Planning for <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>The planning for a new major version of <code>encoding/json</code> spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Mart√≠ (one of the maintainers of <code>encoding/json</code>) first drafted his
thoughts on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQGoM44HLinH4NGBEv5drGlw5_RNW-GP7DdGEpm7Y3o" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">what a hypothetical <code>v2</code> package should look like</a>.
Separately, after previous work on the <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2">Go API for Protocol Buffers</a>,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that <a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson">the <code>protojson</code> package</a>
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because <code>encoding/json</code> was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.</p>
<p>Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on <code>v2</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">started to build a prototype</a>
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgrQPcV8W8EChkaAvv-3NUu6PYmnGG3b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded meetings</a> and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rovrOTd-wTawGMPPlPuKhwXaYBg9VszTXR9AQQL5LfI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>
<p>This work has been public since the beginning,
and we increasingly involved the wider Go community,
first with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GopherCon talk</a> and
<a href="/issue/63397">discussion posted in late 2023</a>,
<a href="/issue/71497">formal proposal posted in early 2025</a>,
and most recently <a href="/issue/71845">adopting <code>encoding/json/v2</code> as a Go experiment</a>
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.</p>
<p>The <code>v2</code> effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that it&rsquo;s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-encodingjsonjsontext">Building on <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></h2>
<p>Before discussing the <code>v2</code> API, we first introduce the experimental
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext"><code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></a> package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.</p>
<p>JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>syntactic functionality</em> that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and</li>
<li><em>semantic functionality</em> that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the terms &ldquo;encode&rdquo; and &ldquo;decode&rdquo; to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms &ldquo;marshal&rdquo; and &ldquo;unmarshal&rdquo; to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.</p>

<p>This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the <code>jsontext</code> package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the <code>json/v2</code> package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>jsontext</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

<p>The <code>jsontext</code> package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8259, section 2</a>
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called <code>JSON-text</code>.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.</p>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Encoder"><code>Encoder</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a>
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Options">accept variadic options</a>
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types declared in <code>v1</code>,
the new types in <code>jsontext</code> avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.</p>
<p>A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Value">a named <code>[]byte</code></a>.
It is identical to <a href="/pkg/encoding/json#RawMessage"><code>RawMessage</code></a> in <code>v1</code>.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Token">opaque <code>Token</code> type</a>
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to <a href="/pkg/encoding/json#Token"><code>Token</code></a> in <code>v1</code>
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.</p>
<p>To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the <code>MarshalJSON</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In <code>v2</code>, we introduce the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods
that operate on an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>, allowing the methods&rsquo; implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the <code>json</code> package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by <code>MarshalJSON</code>,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>. These responsibilities belong to the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-encodingjsonv2">Introducing <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>Building on the <code>jsontext</code> package, we now introduce the experimental
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2"><code>encoding/json/v2</code></a> package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the <code>v1</code> package.
Our goal is that usages of <code>v1</code> will operate <em>mostly</em> the same if directly migrated to <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of <code>v2</code>.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#pkg-examples">the examples in the <code>v2</code> package</a> or
read <a href="https://antonz.org/go-json-v2/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anton Zhiyanov&rsquo;s blog covering the topic</a>.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>v2</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshal"><code>Marshal</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshal"><code>Unmarshal</code></a> functions
have a signature similar to <code>v1</code>, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalWrite"><code>MarshalWrite</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalRead"><code>UnmarshalRead</code></a> functions
directly operate on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>
just to write or read from such types.
The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalEncode"><code>MarshalEncode</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalDecode"><code>UnmarshalDecode</code></a> functions
operate on a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> and <code>jsontext.Decoder</code> and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike <code>v1</code>, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of <code>v2</code>.
There are <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Options">several options available</a>
in <code>v2</code> which are not covered by this article.</p>
<h3 id="type-specified-customization">Type-specified customization</h3>
<p>Similar to <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> interfaces
are identical to those in <code>v1</code>.
The new <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a>
and <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a> interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> or <code>jsontext.Decoder</code>.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the <code>Options</code> accessor method on the <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-OrderedObject">the <code>OrderedObject</code> example</a>
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.</p>
<h3 id="caller-specified-customization">Caller-specified customization</h3>
<p>In <code>v2</code>, the caller of <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.</p>
<pre><code>func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
</code></pre>
<p><a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalFunc"><code>MarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalToFunc"><code>MarshalToFunc</code></a>
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a <code>Marshal</code> call
using <code>WithMarshalers</code> to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFunc"><code>UnmarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFromFunc"><code>UnmarshalFromFunc</code></a>
support similar customization for <code>Unmarshal</code>.</p>
<p><a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-ProtoJSON">The <code>ProtoJSON</code> example</a>
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
<a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Message"><code>proto.Message</code></a> types
to be handled by the <a href="/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"><code>protojson</code></a> package.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-differences">Behavior differences</h3>
<p>While <code>v2</code> aims to behave <em>mostly</em> the same as <code>v1</code>,
its behavior has changed <a href="/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">in some ways</a>
to address problems in <code>v1</code>, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> redefines the <code>omitempty</code> tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; JSON value (which are <code>null</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error when trying to serialize a <code>time.Duration</code>,
which currently has <a href="/issue/71631">no default representation</a>,
but provides options to let the caller decide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See <a href="/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">&ldquo;Migrating to v2&rdquo;</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-optimizations">Performance optimizations</h3>
<p>The <code>Marshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is roughly at parity with <code>v1</code>.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The <code>Unmarshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is significantly faster than <code>v1</code>,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.</p>
<p>In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> should
migrate to also implement
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a> and
<a href="/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a>,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi/issues/315" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes/kube-openapi#315</a>),
while switching to <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> improved performance by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>go-json-experiment/jsonbench</code></a>
repository.</p>
<h2 id="retroactively-improving-encodingjson">Retroactively improving <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood, <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradual migration</strong>: The <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions in <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics.
Options can be specified that configure <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> to operate with
entirely <code>v1</code>, mostly <code>v1</code> with a some <code>v2</code>, a mix of <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>,
mostly <code>v2</code> with some <code>v1</code>, or entirely <code>v2</code> semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature inheritance</strong>: As backward-compatible features are added to <code>v2</code>,
they will inherently be made available in <code>v1</code>. For example, <code>v2</code> adds
support for several new struct tag options such as <code>inline</code> or <code>format</code> and also
support for the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>, it will inherit support for these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced maintenance</strong>: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a <code>v2</code> change with an equivalent <code>v1</code> change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While select parts of <code>v1</code> may be deprecated over time (supposing <code>v2</code> graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to <code>v2</code> will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for <code>v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-jsonv2">Experimenting with <code>jsonv2</code></h2>
<p>The newer API in the <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2</code> set in your environment or with the <code>goexperiment.jsonv2</code> build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code> means that the underlying implementation of <code>v1</code>
is completely different when building under the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under <code>jsonv2</code> and theoretically nothing new should fail:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
</code></pre>
<p>The re-implementation of <code>v1</code> in terms of <code>v2</code> aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the <a href="/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under <code>jsonv2</code> and
report any regressions <a href="/issues">on the issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on <a href="/issue/71497">go.dev/issue/71497</a>, and help determine the future of Go.</p>

I looked for some alternatives and i came across one called magic wormhole and another called Croc, the first one didnt work on linux for some reason, and went with croc, but it had this one time password that was long and i had to see from computer to computer to see i got it right.... So I started working on this other project that i still don&#39;t have a name for to send stuff from pc1 to pc2 BUT with a whitelisting feature, similarly to an ssh key save your pcs id to be able to send from 1 to 2 without passcode same network of course, but why stop there? let&#39;s say you want to transfer a file to your phone..... one might say linux to iphone or macos to android and whats out there is a pain and slow, i&#39;ve seen it, i&#39;ve use them.... have the ability to transfer files over the same network, even if the device you are sending it to doesnt have the tool installed, fast af.</p> <p>pc1 with tool installed opens secured port (even though its your same network you never know)</p> <p>pc2 with tool can get it with simple command to recieve, it will look for the signal in your network</p> <p>another scenario</p> <p>pc1 with tool wants to share folder with some movies 1GB, shoots command to open the port and get a temp link OR QR code (similar to ngrok pointing to localhost)</p> <p>guest pc or smartphone can open the link OR scan QR code and recieve the files from pc1, but why stop there?</p> <p>how about pc1 wants a file from smartphone?</p> <p>pc1 opens port again and smartphone scans QR code and now guest smartphone can send files to pc1</p> <p>I have other cool stuff to add to balance out security and convenience.</p> <p>I started today and im already able to send file to pc1 to pc2, going to work on the other stuff over the week but i wanted to come here to get peoples honest opinion on the matter, tell me im dumb or something for making something already is out there.</p> <p>Thank you for reading. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mr_dudo"> /u/mr_dudo </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nd1c9l/im_working_on_a_cli_to_send_files_between_pcs/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nd1c9l/im_working_on_a_cli_to_send_files_between_pcs/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have read the book <a href="https://marabos.nl/atomics/memory-ordering.html">https://marabos.nl/atomics/memory-ordering.html</a>. and try to find ways to understand how to safely use weaker atomic ordering.</p> <h1>Example</h1> <p>I have a small example to run with miri (modified from <a href="https://marabos.nl/atomics/memory-ordering.html#seqcst">https://marabos.nl/atomics/memory-ordering.html#seqcst</a>)</p> <pre><code> use std::thread; use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicUsize, Ordering}; static A: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false); static B: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false); static S: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0); fn main() { let a = thread::spawn(|| { A.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst); if !B.load(Ordering::SeqCst) { S.fetch_add(2, Ordering::AcqRel); } }); let b = thread::spawn(|| { B.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst); if !A.load(Ordering::Acquire) { S.fetch_add(1, Ordering::AcqRel); } }); a.join().unwrap(); b.join().unwrap(); println!(&quot;s {}&quot;, S.load(Ordering::SeqCst)); } </code></pre> <p>By default it will print <code>s 1</code> or <code>s 2</code>, which is understandable,</p> <p>But with Zmiri-many-seeds=0..32, <strong>sometimes it will produce 3</strong>. I still don&#39;t understand how it happens.</p> <p>I ask the author of miri: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/4521#issuecomment-3196346410">https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/issues/4521#issuecomment-3196346410</a></p> <blockquote> <p>For your last example (&quot;example 2&quot; in your second post), note that the A.load in thread b is allowed to return an outdated value -- even if the <a href="http://A.store">A.store</a> &quot;already happened&quot; in another thread, there&#39;s no guarantee that that store has propagated to thread b. That&#39;s how both load can return false. This is a classic weak memory example.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Definition</h1> <p>Then I read <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic/memory_order.html#Sequentially-consistent-ordering">http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic/memory_order.html#Sequentially-consistent-ordering</a></p> <p>For my understanding:</p> <ul> <li>SeqCst does not allow instructions before or after to be reordered.</li> <li>Acquire does not allow instructions afterward to be reordered to its previous position.</li> <li>Release does not allow previous instructions to be reordered to after.</li> </ul> <p>But the difference of <code>sequenced-before</code>, <code>appears-before</code> and <code>happens-before</code> got me confused, because they are so mathematical terms, and I&#39;m bad at math :(</p> <pre><code>Note that this means that: 1) as soon as atomic operations that are not tagged memory_order_seq_cst enter the picture, the sequential consistency is lost, 2) the sequentially-consistent fences are only establishing total ordering for the fences themselves, not for the atomic operations in the general case (sequenced-before is not a cross-thread relationship, unlike happens-before). </code></pre> <p>I think it&#39;s difficult to understand it without a proper real-world example. <strong>especially the part &quot;the sequential consistency is lost&quot;</strong></p> <h1>Cache coherent</h1> <p>I&#39;ve read articles about cache coherence protocol, moden cpu have various cache protocl derive from MESI or MOESI model, as well as Invalidation queuesÔºåStore buffers.</p> <p><a href="https://marabos.nl/atomics/hardware.html#reordering">https://marabos.nl/atomics/hardware.html#reordering</a></p> <blockquote> <p>The architectures we‚Äôre focusing on in this chapter, x86-64 and ARM64, are other-multi-copy atomic, which means that write operations, once they are visible to any core, become visible to all cores at the same time. For other-multi-copy atomic architectures, memory ordering is only a matter of instruction reordering.</p> </blockquote> <p>For my understanding on Arm:</p> <ul> <li>A Relaxed/Release store, even it&#39;s weak ordering, we don&#39;t need to worry about it is value not propagated to other thread ?</li> <li>For load(Acquire), if there&#39;s some other atomic value SeqCst ops before it, or we are sure that logically not possible to re-order to eariler position, we don&#39;t need to worry about it will return <em>old value</em> ?</li> </ul> <p>But for the definition of C11 (or C20):</p> <ul> <li>It seems not mentioning cpu cache, so is it possible a load(Acquire) read from dirty cache? or is it possible a store(Release) does not wait for cache flushed?</li> <li>If such model is allowed in C11 (or C20), is there an actual CPU architecture weaker than Arm exists, even if not commonly used?</li> <li>If it&#39;s true such architecture exists, what can we expect to use load(Acquire) and store(Release) correctly? We are sure that load(Acquire)-store(Release) pair is commonly used in spinlock pattern, so it&#39;s only valid in a loop context if load(Acquire) were to return old value?</li> <li>How can we understand the meaning of compare_exchange(false, true, Acquire, Relaxed)? I think the Relaxed here has no meaning on Arm platforms, it&#39;s just equal to compare_exchange(false, true, Acquire, Acquire)</li> </ul> <h1>Crossfire</h1> <p>Actually, all the questions here it to review the atomic usage in crossfire <a href="https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs">https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs</a> . If somebody would like to help me out, it would be most appreciated.</p> <p>For example, I don&#39;t know whether it is correct to use Acquire/Release for is_empty flag in reg_waker() and pop() <a href="https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs/blob/dev/src/waker_registry.rs#L314">https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs/blob/dev/src/waker_registry.rs#L314</a></p> <p>For the moment, I use SeqCst in order to make miri happy. But actually miri does not say what&#39;s wrong, only stop when it thinks there is a deadlock. But after I changed everything to SeqCst, it still reports a deadlock in async case. Later, I started to use log to analyze the problem, and I think there might be a condition race in tokio runtime. <a href="https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs/issues/36">https://github.com/frostyplanet/crossfire-rs/issues/36</a></p> <p>I fired an issue to tokio, currently no body believes it, might have to dig into it later by myself, but it might be another story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/frostyplanet"> /u/frostyplanet </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ncz7oy/how_to_understand_weak_memory_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ncz7oy/how_to_understand_weak_memory_model/">[comments]</a></span></div>

WebAssembly requires its own custom libraries to perform operations like opening sockets, etc., and the operator communicates with the cluster via HTTP requests.</p> <p>A couple of months ago, I wrote a web server that I compiled using some custom libraries:</p> <pre><code>tokio = { git = &quot;https://github.com/second-state/wasi_tokio.git&quot;, branch = &quot;v1.36.x&quot; } socket2 = { git = &quot;https://github.com/second-state/socket2.git&quot;, branch = &quot;v0.5.x&quot; } hyper = { git = &quot;https://github.com/second-state/wasi_hyper.git&quot;, branch = &quot;v0.14.x&quot; } </code></pre> <p>i used this guide as a reference: <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/http_service/server/">https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/http_service/server/</a></p> <p>At that time, I was able to compile the web application without problems.</p> <p>Now, when I try to compile the operator using the same libraries, I get compilation errors saying that TCP and UDP modules used by <code>mio_wasi</code> (called by Tokio or Hyper) are missing.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the weird part: I tried recompiling my old web server for Wam, and now it also fails with multiple errors. I‚Äôm completely stuck and don‚Äôt know how to create this operator.</p> <p>If you need more information, feel free to ask (although I‚Äôm not an expert in this field, so I might not understand some details myself).</p> <p>I‚Äôm desperate, i have to finish the thesis in 2 weeks and i am stucked in this situation for a week now. please help me üò¢ .</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Annual-Pea-8480"> /u/Annual-Pea-8480 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ncpjnz/help_with_compiling_a_kubernetes_operator_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ncpjnz/help_with_compiling_a_kubernetes_operator_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I don‚Äôt usually write posts like this (this is literally my first), but I need to share my story and hear from people more experienced than me.</p> <p>For the past ~5 months, my life has basically been the Rust compiler. What started as a curiosity - fixing a diagnostic I randomly noticed while writing code - turned into an obsession. Since then I‚Äôve merged ~70 PRs (currently <a href="http://thanks.rust-lang.org">thanks.rust-lang.org</a> shows 88 contributions, in master and beta releases I&#39;m current in top 50 contributors and get to top 360 of all time): stabilizing features, fixing ICEs, improving diagnostics, reorganizing tests, and much more. I‚Äôve even started reviewing smaller PRs, and recently a compiler team lead told me I‚Äôm on track for membership in compiler team once I reach the 6 month contribution history (this 6 month gate is just a formality). At 20 years old, that feels surreal, especially since I don‚Äôt have formal work experience or an IT degree.</p> <p>This is, without exaggeration, the most fulfilling thing I‚Äôve ever done. Even if I don‚Äôt always see the end users directly, I know that every fix to diagnostics or every bug resolved makes the language better for countless people - and that‚Äôs incredibly motivating. I want nothing more than to keep doing this.</p> <p>But here‚Äôs the reality: I‚Äôm in Russia, and the financial side is brutal.</p> <p>* GitHub Sponsors doesn‚Äôt work here.</p> <p>* Grants like the Rust Foundation‚Äôs hardship program aren‚Äôt an option either (I even reached out and confirmed that they can‚Äôt send funds to Russia right now).</p> <p>* Sponsorships or contracting from abroad are basically blocked.</p> <p>I‚Äôve also tried applying to a few open source companies that work heavily with Rust, but so far I haven‚Äôt been successful. I suspect part of the reason is that my background is almost entirely open-source and compiler-focused, without the kind of ‚Äútraditional‚Äù industry experience that recruiters usually look for.</p> <p>I feel trapped between choices like:</p> <p>* Do I step away, take a regular job, and accept that my compiler time will shrink to a side hobby?</p> <p>* Do I keep grinding, hoping that somehow an opportunity opens up? (I don&#39;t really have much time for this in my current situation)</p> <p>* Or is there some third path that I can‚Äôt see because I‚Äôm young and inexperienced?</p> <p>Thanks for reading this far. Rust has given me more than I ever imagined, and I truly don‚Äôt want to disappear from the compiler work I care about. I just need to figure out how to make it sustainable.</p> <p>Github page for those who wonder: <a href="https://github.com/Kivooeo/">https://github.com/Kivooeo/</a></p> <p>upd1: As mentioned a few times in the comments: if, for some reason, you‚Äôd like to support me financially until I manage to find a job, here are my crypto wallet addresses:</p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">ETC: 0xe1f27D7B1665D88B72874E327e70e4e439751Cfa</span></p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Solana: Ao3QhbFqBidnMnhKVHxsETmvWBfpL3oZL876FDArCfaX</span></p> <p>upd2: i read each comment so far, thank you guys for your support and kind words, this means so much for me and motivating to keep going, i will try to make LinkedIn works and try to reach some of leads in companies, as well as try to get international card abroad and contact with Rust Foundation once again. I will continue reading and time to time answering you guys! Love you so much again for you support! </p> <p>P.S. I know I‚Äôm not entitled to be paid for open source, and I don‚Äôt want this to be a pity post. But right now I‚Äôm at a point where it‚Äôs hard to see a way forward, and I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing from people who‚Äôve been through something similar - whether it‚Äôs turning OSS contributions into a career, balancing passion projects with survival jobs, or finding unconventional paths.

We built lazily evaluated database schema migrations (in Rust obviously)! </p> <p>TL;DR<br/> You can make changes to your node or edge schemas (we&#39;re still working on vectors) and it will migrate the existing data (lazily) over time.</p> <p>More info:<br/> The way it works is by defining schema versions, you state how you want the field names to be changed, removed, or added (you can set default values for new fields). Once you&#39;ve deployed the migration workflow, when the database attempts to read the data that abides by the old schema it gets passed through the workflow to be displayed in the new schema. If any new writes are made, they will be made using the new schema. If any updates are made to the data abiding by the old schema, that node or edge is overwritten when the update is made to match the new schema. This allows users to migrate their databases with no downtime!</p> <p>If you want to follow our guide and try it out, you can here: <a href="https://www.helix-db.com/blog/schema-migrations-in-helixdb-main">https://www.helix-db.com/blog/schema-migrations-in-helixdb-main</a></p> <p>And if you could give us a star on our repo we&#39;d really appreciate it :) ‚≠êÔ∏è <a href="https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db">https://github.com/HelixDB/helix-db</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MoneroXGC"> /u/MoneroXGC </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nch59o/lazily_evaluated_database_migrations_in_helixdb/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nch59o/lazily_evaluated_database_migrations_in_helixdb/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started learning Rust with The Book in my corporate issued laptop, a Windows machine where I don&#39;t have admin rights and it has Crowdstrike Falcon Sensor installed. First examples compiled and ran fine, but soon some failed with &quot;os error 5&quot;. Digging a bit, I found some posts suggesting AV interference. And indeed I noticed the executable was deleted when running cargo run or running it directly.</p> <p>Some posts mentioned that small executables without much purpose could trigger the AV heuristics, and adding a dependency to the project could help. So I tried adding tokio to the rect_area example, which wasn&#39;t running in debug due to os error 5, and wrapped the main() code in a blocking task. And it worked! Example ran fine this time.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi yall, I&#39;m excited to announce that Zoi v5 beta is released.</p> <p>Zoi is a package manager, like pacman and nix, you package software with Lua and it has a build system for packages and a rich dependency system.</p> <p>Zoi can build a package archive for you without building the software from source, if your software you&#39;re trying to package already provides a binary or a compressed binary (tar.gz, tar.xz, tar.zsr, zip) or from source if you want.</p> <p>Zoi will downloads the binaries and extract them, verify their checksums and signatures (if provided) and package them into a <code>name-version-os-arch-pkg.tar.zst</code> archive.</p> <p>Zoi has a <code>pgp</code> command for handling pgp keys and reuse them to verify the signatures of the software, and a <code>man</code> command to view the manual of a package (either installed locally or from the upstream URL).</p> <p>Zoi also has a lot of more features, such as dependency handling with 40+ package managers, an extensions system, repo management (you can change the git registry (Zoi package registries are simple git repos) to your own to to one of Zoi&#39;s mirrors, you can create your own registry with an archive packages repo to install the <code>pkg.tar.zst</code> archives, and you can add mirrors for both), also you can add git repos as repos and access them with this format <code>@git/repo-name/package</code> if you don&#39;t want to replace the package registry.</p> <p>Or you can install a package from a git repo (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg) from a <code>zoi.yaml</code> in that repo to install the package.</p> <p>```sh zoi install --repo gh:Zillowe/Hello</p> <h1>GitHub by default so no need to specify gh, GitLab gl, Codeberg cb</h1> <p>```</p> <p>Zoi install commands works like this: 1. Read the <code>repo.yaml</code> and see if there&#39;s an archive packages repo. 2. If there&#39;s it will install the <code>pkg.tar.zst</code> for that package. 3. If it fails or there isn&#39;t it will try to build a <code>pkg.tar.zst</code> then install it. 4 if that fails or package type isn&#39;t supported it will fallback into the normal installation by getting the sources and place them into their location.</p> <p>Install Zoi with these package managers:</p> <p>```sh yay -S zoi-bin</p> <p>brew install Zillowe/tap/Zoi</p> <p>scoop add bucket <a href="https://github.com/Zillowe/scoop.git">https://github.com/Zillowe/scoop.git</a> scoop install zoi</p> <p>npx @zillowe/zoi ```</p> <p>Or via an installer script:</p> <p><code>sh curl -fsSL https://zillowe.pages.dev/scripts/zoi/install.sh | bash </code></p> <p>Or from source using Cargo:</p> <p><code>sh cargo install zoi-rs </code></p> <p>Some working examples:</p> <p><code>sh zoi install @zillowe/hello </code></p> <p><code>sh zoi man @zillowe/hello </code></p> <p>There&#39;s a lot of other features that I can&#39;t cover, like there&#39;s a lot of package types such as service, config, extension, and more.</p> <p>With Zoi you can replace Omarchy (v1) and Omakub with a package type of config. And also some of Nix functionality.</p> <p>Also Zoi is a library so you can add it to your own Rust applications.</p> <p><code>sh cargo add zoi-rs </code></p> <p>Also there&#39;s an example package <code>@zillowe/hello</code> follow the guide to learn how to package a package: <a href="https://github.com/Zillowe/Hello">https://github.com/Zillowe/Hello</a></p> <p>All features are documented in the docs so please take a look at them because there&#39;s a lot.</p> <p>Docs: <a href="https://zillowe.qzz.io/docs/zds/zoi">https://zillowe.qzz.io/docs/zds/zoi</a></p> <p>I welcome contributors since I&#39;m the only maintainer and specifically with contributing in the docs because it needs some work.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Zillowe/Zoi">https://github.com/Zillowe/Zoi</a></p> <p>This should be the last release before v1 stable.</p> <p>Join my discord server (it&#39;s in the GitHub repo).</p> <p>Also I&#39;m not aiming on a big package registry, I&#39;m just providing a tool for people to use and build their own thing (if you want to upload your package to Zoi official package registry is welcome because a big package registry would be neat).</p> <p>Some of the next features I&#39;m planning to implement: - Project specific packages, defining package in the local <code>zoi.yaml</code> and install these packages into a local <code>.zoi/</code> directory without adding it to PATH and runnable via <code>zoi exec</code> command.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Important-Toe-9188"> /u/Important-Toe-9188 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nc80rj/zoi_an_advanced_package_manager_v5_beta_release/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1nc80rj/zoi_an_advanced_package_manager_v5_beta_release/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m excited to share a project I&#39;ve been working on: <strong>GoPdfSuit</strong>, a high-performance Go web service designed for creating PDF documents from HTML and JSON templates. It&#39;s built on Go 1.23+ and the Gin framework, and it&#39;s completely open source under the MIT license.</p> <p>I created this because I was tired of slow, clunky, and expensive commercial PDF solutions. GoPdfSuit is designed to be a fast, simple, and flexible microservice that you can drop into any project.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ultra-Fast Performance:</strong> It can generate PDFs with sub-millisecond to low-millisecond response times, making it incredibly efficient for high-load applications.</li> <li><strong>Template-Driven:</strong> It uses a JSON-driven template system, which means you can generate complex, data-rich PDFs without writing any code. It also has a built-in web interface for real-time preview and editing.</li> <li><strong>HTML to PDF/Image Conversion:</strong> Easily convert entire web pages or HTML snippets into PDFs or images.</li> <li><strong>Interactive Forms:</strong> Supports AcroForm and XFDF data for filling out interactive forms.</li> <li><strong>Easy Deployment:</strong> It&#39;s deployed as a single binary, making it simple to get up and running.</li> <li><strong>Language Agnostic:</strong> Since it uses a REST API, you can use it with any programming language.</li> </ul> <p>GoPdfSuit is a more flexible and cost-effective alternative to many existing solutions. If you work with PDFs, I&#39;d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think!</p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit">https://github.com/chinmay-sawant/gopdfsuit</a></li> <li><strong>Project Page:</strong> <a href="https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/">https://chinmay-sawant.github.io/gopdfsuit/</a></li> </ul> <p>Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chinmay06"> /u/chinmay06 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ncbiwb/i_built_an_ultrafast_opensource_go_web_service/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ncbiwb/i_built_an_ultrafast_opensource_go_web_service/">[comments]</a></span></div>
