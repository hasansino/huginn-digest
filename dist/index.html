            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, I am the developer of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321850/HyperCoven/">HyperCoven</a>, an RTS with some unique ideas, that scales to a few thousand units.</p> <p>Even disregarding the fact that it‚Äôs notoriously hard to make an RTS in a general purpose engine like Godot; I very much knew I wanted the &quot;classic&quot; unit behaviour of RTS of old. That means, no huddling of units into giant blobs; not even making way for other units. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxx55e1ZQCY">(Cf.)</a> So I set out to make my own engine. (Btw. if you love blobs, and overkill prevention, and all that, I have no idea why you wouldn‚Äôt just make an Sc2 custom map instead of trying to make an RTS in Unreal Engine.)</p> <p>A friend prompted me to do a write-up of the development, so here goes, I hope I have something interesting to say.</p> <h1>Logic Engine</h1> <p>Going to start by talking about the part that is to me the most interesting, which is the game logic itself. It lives in a library of its own now. That library knows nothing about user input, it only takes abstract RTS commands (e.g. &quot;select units number 1,2,5&quot; or &quot;selected units should move to position 5x10&quot;). It knows nothing about on-screen pixel positions either, it only talks in map coordinates. It does not do any timing either. That means the engine can run completely headless for replay validation. Or it can be tied into a front-end that will take care of rendering, timing, converting user inputs, etc.</p> <p>The original motivation for splitting up libraries was that I started <a href="https://docs.rs/iftree/latest/iftree/">embedding all assets</a> into the executable, and this somehow made code check times in the editor (I use emacs+LSP) unbearably slow. So I factored out the asset loading, later factored out the front-end (without assets) as well, leaving the engine alone, which is pretty neat. Whenever I change the engine library, I know that probably old replays will become incompatible. If I change the other libraries, I know replays stay working. (Replays have been tremendously useful, by the way, for reproducing engine bugs. A replay is obviously nothing but a list of ticks with their abstract RTS commands.)</p> <p>I knew from the start what architecture I wanted to go for. Roughly speaking, the idea was to have agents (dyn method calls), and their signature would be, getting a readonly handle to the current game state, as well as a mut pointer to a structure containing desired &quot;effects&quot; the agent would wish to create on the game state. A basic effect would be &quot;deal x damage to unit number n.&quot; After collecting all effects from agents, a singular piece of code would go over them all and actually apply them, mutating the game state.</p> <p>This plan I had before I even picked Rust, but naturally it fits Rust well. Only problem is the agent cannot keep an actual pointer to &quot;my own entity&quot; that points into the game state itself; it has to keep an ID which is just an offset in a huge array containing all entities. So basically the very basic ECS idea. I never put a real ECS library into the project, but one might say that I have a hardcoded ECS with a few components by now. Most notable component is the main struct representing the entity (hit points, who controls it, a bunch of flags), but there is a few others on the side, for example to track recent damage taken (for aggro), some very technical state about unit movement, ... these additional states are kept in traditional maps, not in a &quot;slot map&quot; array, because they are on-off things that are not always needed for every unit.</p> <p>The logic for queuing agent functions has grown very intricate. The idea from the start was that the function would return an offset, in game ticks, of when to call it again. This would give a very natural way to model &quot;I am attacking, hitting the enemy every 10 ticks.&quot; Problems arise when trying to keep units responsive: If the user gives a new order, you don‚Äôt want to wait until the next agent invokation, you want to switch to the new order immediately. But if the new order is the same as the old one - you do not want to switch. Else you might be able to speed up attack timers by spamming attack command (had that bug often enough). For attacks, you can keep a simple reload timer, for movement it gets even more complicated. This took a lot of tweaks to get right. Now agents do not just return an offset, but also information on how they can be interrupted, if at all.</p> <p>The agent code itself is a whole nother topic, naturally this is where the edge case bugs happen. I explicitly wanted it to be dyn functions, so that it could easily be anything, without having to adjust some huge state machine or enum with a new variant. But that also means, agent functions really cannot expect anything from the outside world. They have their own private state, but they do not in that sense &quot;own&quot; any entity: They have no exclusive write access to any piece of gamestate. On every invokation, they need to check, is the entity I am trying to steer still alive, is my objective still valid?</p> <p>I tried to make a bunch of generic wrappers for these things, like an &quot;attack execution&quot; wrapper where you would plug in some other trait modeling the actual attack, while the wrapper would take care of checking target legality, and so on. Also for target aggro: There is some system whereby target selection methods (e.g. &quot;nearby enemies&quot;) can be paired with actions (mostly attacks) that declare, via generics, that they can legally be applied to those targets... I got it working, but honestly it is a mess in terms of code that could be much improved. My main mistake was ‚Ä¶ there are now &quot;contexts,&quot; so far, so good, a context is basically the parameter bundle telling an attack agent who is attacking whom, for example. So the agent says, my context will need to implement traits &quot;Us&quot; and &quot;Them&quot; - the point here is that one implementation of Them might be &quot;HostileTarget&quot; which invalidates the target once it‚Äôs no longer hostile, while another implementation might be &quot;ForcedTarget&quot; which invalidates the target only when it‚Äôs dead.</p> <p>The mistake was trying (for days) to enable the contexts to store and supply direct pointers to game entities. It‚Äôs an insane lifetime mess. What I should have done is optimise the main entity struct to be small enough that cloning it doesn‚Äôt hurt. Very likely the compiler will elide the clone in 99% of cases, anyways, because we only have a readonly handle to the gamestate so there is not even a risk of aliasing any writes we do to a piece of entity data we (should have) cloned. I am just repeating this. Never try storing pointers in Rust if you don‚Äôt have to. Access through a slot ID is basically as cheap as access through a pointer, too.</p> <p>Pathfinding. Probably the central topic to making an RTS? It easily takes up 90% of computation time in Hypercoven. Might as well not even bother optimising any of the other aspects?</p> <p>I started out by using the aptly named <a href="https://docs.rs/pathfinding/">pathfinding</a> crate and can only recommend it. Its generic A* implementation is as good as can be. The nature of the Rust language and compiler means it can inline very aggressively; so even though it looks like you may have to build a Vec of reachable positions to return from &quot;neighbours&quot; function, the compiler will, in practice, very likely be able to inline it all and transform it into a simple loop over neighbour positions, that does no allocation at all. As it should be.</p> <p>The only optimisation angle I eventually found is that this implementation naturally has to keep the graph of visited nodes in an associative map. It uses indexmap, which is as fast as can be for the generic case; but if you have an <em>actual</em> 2D grid represented in a large array, that large array will be faster. This is very use-case dependant; it‚Äôs not a generic graph.</p> <p>This whole &quot;we are pathfinding in a flat 2D space&quot; also made me think about rolling my own pathfinding algorithm once, which was based on walking around obstacles, simply put. It did manage to outperform A* quite nicely for finding any path, but for finding <em>a good</em> path it grew very, very complicated, and slow. I can only say, if you make a game, it is likely that you want A*. If A* is too slow, optimise it for your case. (Aside: I tried a few BinaryHeap implementations other than the std-lib one, and they all were much slower.)</p> <p>By the way, this 2D space of ours is not so simple. A feature I hacked into the game quite early is that the map can &quot;wrap around&quot; infinitely. This is based on isometric coordinates, so you are leaving the map on the upper-left edge, appearing again on the lower-right edge, which is &quot;the opposite side.&quot; The motivation for this was‚Ä¶ the game is centered around the Witch King, the only unit that is truly yours. He walks around and captures Coven that produce units for you. Since you lose when the Witch King dies, I wanted to reduce the risk of him just getting cornered. Hence the idea of having no corners. (I was also motivated by it just appearing to be an incredibly dank idea.)</p> <p>A* actually covers this case perfectly. It doesn‚Äôt care at all about the shape of the world, or if the world even has any shape at all. (My custom algo would have grown incredibly more complex to account for it. Maybe impossible.)</p> <p>The wrap-around is of course a modulus operation, but, as I learned, this is euclidean modulus and the default in most languages, including Rust (but not Ruby), is the other kind of modulus. Be that as it may be, this mod operation is actually costly, as it amplifies the pathfinding (needed for estimating distances) cost. I ended up using a very dumb &quot;optimised&quot; implementation which expects the value to be withing +/- 1 multiples of the length, to get around the costly CPU instructions. (Another approach would be to only permit map side lengths that are powers of 2 and doing a bit-AND based on that.)</p> <h1>Frontend</h1> <p>I started out by using plain SDL2 (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/sdl2">Rust bindings</a>, which are very good) for all the user-interactive things. SDL2_gfx, SDL2_ttf... This gets you very far and could still easily power the whole project, it would just look a bit worse. The reason I looked into other options was wanting to use shaders for a few select things, like the fog of war. The initial fog of war I did, with SDL2, was just drawing a texture over every fogged tile. This is absolutely fine in terms of performance, because SDL2 automatically batches subsequent copies of the same texture into a single instanced draw-call. It just cannot be pixel-perfect (at every zoom level) for hexagons, which I used for the game‚Äôs tiles. I mean, for fog on rectangular tiles you don‚Äôt even need a texture, you can just draw rectangles. (Don‚Äôt try to make hexagons with SDL2_gfx, it is very costly.)</p> <p>Another problem with SDL2 was the <a href="https://filmstars.itch.io/hypercoven">browser version</a> I eventually built. It was actually really easy with emscripten, took just a few days; I mean, it could have gone a lot quicker, if the rust-libc layer for emscripten wasn‚Äôt severely undermaintained and hence bug-ridden. Nobody really uses this target. Especially since wasm_bindgen paradoxically does not work with emscripten, so you are in the browser but actually not, but you are also not on a real Unix, just a coarsely emulated one.</p> <p>I will still recommend the SDL2+emscripten stack to anyone looking to make a simple 2D game and ship it in the browser, it really is extremely simple and robust, as long as you are doing basic stuff.</p> <p>So eventually I began hacking a new browser version that would be based on winit and wgpu. <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">Winit</a> is basically a straight-up replacement for the user-input and window-creation parts of SDL. It‚Äôs decent. It supports both native and browser, so I got a native version based on winit as well, but it‚Äôs a bit jankier than SDL, so I am not shipping it and still maintaining both front-ends instead. Generally the event handling concept in winit is radically different, as it tries to &quot;truly&quot; support browsers and mobile OS, which makes the whole thing very asynchronous and request-based. You cannot just decide to do something, you have to request the OS layer to permit it. You cannot just draw, you have to request_redraw(). This IS perfect in the browser and gives way smoother frames than the black magic done by emscripten to simulate synchronous draw on present() calls. But on an actual GAMING OS like Linux, the more fine-grained control of a custom SDL2 event loop is just nicer.</p> <p>By the way, did you know that sleeping on Windows is not as accurate as one would like it to be? There is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/spin_sleep">a whole crate</a> out there dedicated to nailing sleep times as best as possible across different OS. Very relevant to making game run smooth. But yeah, you cannot plug that into winit.</p> <p><a href="https://wgpu.rs/">wgpu</a> is a library aiming to support a plethora of modern GPU back-ends (Metal, Vulkan, DirectX but also still OpenGL). The API is based on the upcoming WebGPU standard, and so, it does of course support WebGPU as well, which is a huge selling point in the browser, as it can do compute shaders and is generally more powerful than ye olde WebGL. The WebGPU JavaScript API is probably nice to work with, I wouldn‚Äôt know. The Rust version of the API did have the problem of some really silly lifetime requirements that made it very hard to achieve my goal, which was rewriting the SDL2 renderer on top of wgpu, so that I could easily swap it out. In Rust-SDL2, you have a Texture&lt;&#39;a&gt;, but &#39;a is just the lifetime of the TextureCreator. It doesn‚Äôt really matter. When calling canvas.copy(texture, src, dst), you pass in &amp;Texture&lt;&#39;a&gt;. Eventually you call canvas.present(). All good. When trying to write the equivalent function on wgpu, it became .copy(texture: &amp;&#39;a Texture, src, dst), where &#39;a would have to hold until present(). That is because in wgpu you create a RenderPass object for this, and all resources referenced in the render pass need to outlive it. You can swap the RenderPass object out when calling present(), but you cannot really express this stupid lifetime requirement, nor was my code designed in a way that really guaranteed it. This is just a story from the trenches. The wgpu folks have since adjusted their API, and these lifetime requirements are now gone. (I still have to dispel the unholy rituals that were once used to satisfy them from my code.) At the same (?) time, wgpu performance has tanked for me in Firefox nightly on Linux, unfortunately. But WebGPU does work extremely well in Chrome on Windows. All other browser engines still fall back to WebGL, afaik.</p> <h1>&quot;Cache&quot;</h1> <p>As time went on, I recognised the increasing complexity of actually displaying the game state. The main entity struct contained a bunch of fields which were only really relevant for displaying it. So I split off all that stuff into another layer, which lives outside the engine core. The engine still has to steer it: An attack agent must declare, with proper timing, the start of an attack animation. There is no other place really where it could be done. But this declaration is only written by the logic engine; it‚Äôs not read. The &quot;cache&quot; is reading and storing it.</p> <p>It takes care of a whole large bunch of temporary information regarding entities, some of which information may be slightly massaged, or slightly incorrect, just to make the game look more sensible on screen. (It‚Äôs called cache because caches are always wrong.) The nice thing is that we can be sure that none of this incorrectness will affect the actual game logic. It‚Äôs just fudging on the display layer.</p> <p>As the logic engine is running on a dedicated thread, we also have ample time on this display layer to do calculations, without ever lagging the game logic. There‚Äôs many things done here, most of it related to calculating pixels, caching some of that information for faster render times, ... and storing all sorts of debris that are not relevant to the game rules. Not just fallen units, but also doodads, ongoing explosions, etc. It‚Äôs very nice to have all this freedom and breathing room for the visuals.</p> <h1>Menus</h1> <p>I‚Äôm not a UI guy, which is evidenced by this game for sure. I even dreaded making the HUD, though the HUD is really useful for playing the game, one must admit. For starting the game, it was all commandline to select gamemode and so on. Unfortunately that‚Äôs not within reason for the average player, so I eventually figured this really nice solution for a guy that can‚Äôt write UI like me, which is called &quot;immediate mode UI&quot; and a lot of fun. I‚Äôm using <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">egui</a> specifically.</p> <p>The problem is that you can‚Äôt easily integrate egui with an SDL2 application. So what I did was I built a launcher type thing, that would start the actual game as a different process. This was widely hated, it also turned out that it wouldn‚Äôt properly work with Steam, meaning the Steam ingame overlay and so on. Since I had moved to wgpu at that point, I was now able to integrate the whole egui launcher application into the main application, using the same wgpu setup to draw the menu or the game, depending. I even managed to get an overlay menu ingame work, that will render on the same render pass as the game, if it‚Äôs active.</p> <p>The problem is, all this looks like crap. egui is nice to work with, it is relatively robust, it has some pre-made table component that is at least usable. But to custom-style it boils down to changing colors, corner angles, fonts. You can‚Äôt really &quot;take over&quot; the whole appearance. You can‚Äôt even put in textures from your game, really, unless you load them twice. If I were to do it all over again, I would try going for iced-rs, which promises more tedious UI-programming, but very slick integration with your existing renderer, you basically have full control.</p> <h1>Multiplayer</h1> <p>Almost forgot about this one, since it‚Äôs basically the simplest part of the whole project. Multiplayer is just a distributed streaming replay. I‚Äôm using <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/">ENet</a> to get the latency extra low. The server is completely game-agnostic, it just broadcasts the inputs received from players, and ticks the gamestate.</p> <p>(I was at first trying to make it peer-to-peer, but really, don‚Äôt do this to yourself. At the very least, most people don‚Äôt even have an IpV4 address anymore these days, so they can‚Äôt port-forward even if they wanted to. (ENet Rust only works on IpV4.))</p> <p>What‚Äôs more fickle is the lobby server, where you actually set up the game. This lobby server is like a little game or game engine of its own. It gets inputs (messages sent over websocket - <a href="https://docs.rs/warp">tokio/warp</a> are the tech here) from connected would-be players, and has to serialise the application of requested mutations (create game lobby, join game lobby, kick player, etc.) onto its global state, while making sure that everyone who is connected also learns of the new state correctly, and so forth. I understand there‚Äôs a few generic solutions for this already out there - if I was looking for more features, I would definitely evaluate them. For now I am content to have not even a player sign-up, just a basic &quot;connect here with any nickname, create or join a game, and start it. with chat.&quot; functionality.</p> <h1>Closing</h1> <p>That‚Äôs as much as I could think of, for now. It was mostly a lot of fun, making the game. If you got questions, drop them in the comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Tilmsfars"> /u/Tilmsfars </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1my52m2/insights_from_shipping_a_realtime_strategy_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1my52m2/insights_from_shipping_a_realtime_strategy_game/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I have a question about the best practices when it comes to getting data from json (eg. API). I&#39;m only learning, but my (hopefully logical) assumption is, that I should either already have some json spec/doc/schema (if supplied by provider) or define something myself (if not). For example, let&#39;s say I get users list form some API; if suddenly `lastName` becomes `last-Name` I&#39;d like the method to inform/error about it, as opposed to get all the users, except with empty string in place of where `lastName` should be. In other words, depending on what data I need, and what I&#39;m planning to do with it, some rules and boundaries should be set upfront (?).</p> <p>Now, trying to do that in practice turned out to be more tricky than I thought; first of all, it seems like `json.Unmarshal` doesn&#39;t really care about the input structure; as long as json has a valid syntax it will just get it into an object (and unless I&#39;m missing something, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to do it differently).</p> <p>I then turned into some 3rd party packages that are supposed to validate against jsonschema, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something wrong, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work the way I&#39;d expect it to; for example, here I have schema that expects 3 fields (2 of which are mandatory), and yet none of the validators I tried seem to see any of those issues I would expect (despite of the 2nd raw json having literally 0 valid properties): <a href="https://go.dev/play/p/nLiD41p7Ex7">https://go.dev/play/p/nLiD41p7Ex7</a> ; one of the validators reports a problem with it expecting string instead of array, but frankly I don&#39;t get it, when you look at both json and the data.</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something or approaching it the wrong way altogether? I mean, I know it would be possible to unmarshal json and then validate/remove data that does not meet the criteria, but to me it seems more cumbersome and less efficient (?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SzynekZ"> /u/SzynekZ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1myewjd/validating_json_structure_beforewhen_unmarshaling/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1myewjd/validating_json_structure_beforewhen_unmarshaling/">[comments]</a></span></div>
