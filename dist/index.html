But it has long since drifted from the underlying C library it is based on. The underlying C library is Dear Imgui.</p> <p>Dear Imgui is a very popular GUI library written in C++. Its popularity means that it is under constant development and new features are added often. It has therefore, unsurprisingly, changed significantly since imgui-go was last updated. I wanted some of the new features to be available in my Go applications so I&#39;ve decided to fork the project and make the required changes myself.</p> <p>The new repository is here: <a href="https://github.com/JetSetIlly/imgui-go">https://github.com/JetSetIlly/imgui-go</a> And the updated examples repository: <a href="https://github.com/JetSetIlly/imgui-go-examples">https://github.com/JetSetIlly/imgui-go-examples</a></p> <p>This project definitely isn&#39;t for everyone but it might be of interest to users of the original inkyblackness project. If anyone does still need this project, I&#39;m happy to accept pull-requests to fill in the missing pieces.</p> <p>I should also mention cimgui-go, which is an alternative solution for bringing Dear Imgui to Go. I&#39;ve looked at cimgui-go and I can see that it&#39;s a great solution and probably a better choice if you&#39;re starting a new GUI project. However, it&#39;s not a good solution for my needs at this time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JetSetIlly"> /u/JetSetIlly </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lmtpof/imguigo_v5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lmtpof/imguigo_v5/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey Go developers,</p> <p>For the past few months, I&#39;ve been building a backend project which I will be most probably naming it as <strong>gosaas</strong>, and I&#39;m considering open-sourcing it. Before I go through the effort of cleaning it up, documenting everything, and committing to maintenance, I wanted to get your thoughts and see if this is something the community would find useful.</p> <h1>The Concept</h1> <p>The core idea was to build a &quot;Backend-as-a-Service&quot; (like PocketBase or Supabase) but designed from the ground up for <strong>true multi-tenancy with strict data isolation</strong>. Instead of using row-level security in a single database, <strong>gosaas gives every tenant their own dedicated PostgreSQL database,</strong> <strong>which can be distributed across a fleet of database servers.</strong></p> <h1>The Features I&#39;ve Built So Far</h1> <p>I wanted this to be a true &quot;batteries-included&quot; backend, so it comes with a lot of the features you&#39;d expect from a modern backend, all manageable via the API and a built-in Admin UI:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Multi-Server Architecture:</strong> Manage a fleet of PostgreSQL servers. <code>gosaas</code> can automatically place new tenants on the least-loaded server.</li> <li>Automagic CRUD API: Full POST, GET, PATCH, DELETE, and bulk PUT (upsert) endpoints for any collection.</li> <li>Advanced Querying: The list endpoint supports rich filtering with &amp;&amp;, ||, (), sorting, pagination, and nested eager loading (?expand=ledger_id).</li> <li>Dynamic Schema Builder: A set of admin APIs (and a UI) to dynamically create/alter collections and their columns (including relationships/foreign keys) across all tenants by automatically generating and running new migration files.</li> <li>Dynamic, Scriptable Hooks: Instead of compiled Go hooks, you can write business logic in JavaScript (via Goja) and save it through the Admin UI. This allows for on-the-fly logic changes without redeploying the backend. We even have a &quot;recache&quot; button to pre-compile all hooks for performance.</li> <li>Realtime API: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates on create, update, and delete events for any collection.</li> <li>File Storage: A complete file management system with S3 as the storage backend.</li> <li>Full-Text Search: Out-of-the-box integration with Meilisearch. Data in specified collections is automatically indexed.</li> <li>Dynamic OpenAPI Docs: A <code>/docs</code> endpoint that automatically generates a full OpenAPI/Swagger specification by inspecting your tenant&#39;s live database schema with beautiful stoplight elements UI.</li> <li>Authentication: <ul> <li>Standard email/password login, password resets, and user invites.</li> <li>Dynamic OAuth2: Admins can enable and configure providers (Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.) directly from the UI by adding their credentials, which are stored securely in the database.</li> </ul></li> <li>Observability: <ul> <li>Logging with zerolog.</li> <li>Monitoring endpoint (/metrics) for Prometheus or VictoriaMetrics, providing per-tenant stats.</li> </ul></li> <li>Admin UI: A complete SvelteKit single-page application, embedded into the final Go binary, for managing tenants, users, platform settings (S3/SMTP/OAuth keys), and the dynamic schema and hooks.</li> </ul> <h1>The Big Question</h1> <p>My goal was to create something that feels extremely easy for the developer but is architecturally better suited for building SaaS products where tenant data isolation is a hard requirement and deployment is hassle free using a single binary.</p> <p>So, my questions for you are:</p> <ol> <li>Is this something you would use?</li> <li>What critical features do you think are missing?</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;d love to hear any thoughts, criticisms, or suggestions you have. Thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jiteshgolecha"> /u/jiteshgolecha </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lmpm2j/an_opensource_multitenant_backend_engine_in_go/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lmpm2j/an_opensource_multitenant_backend_engine_in_go/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We spend so much time thinking about Redis and Memcached for caching that we forget about the disk sitting right there on our servers.</p> <p>Every API call to a remote cache means network latency. Every network hop adds milliseconds. In high-throughput applications, those milliseconds compound quickly.</p> <p>Local caching isn&#39;t just about performance, it&#39;s about reducing dependencies. When your remote cache goes down or network gets congested, your local cache still works. It&#39;s a fallback that&#39;s always available.</p> <p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m building Ignite, not a database, but an SDK to efficiently read and write to your filesystem. Think of it as a smart way to use your local disk as a caching layer before hitting Redis or making database calls.</p> <p>It&#39;s not about replacing your existing infrastructure. It&#39;s about using resources you already have more strategically. Every server has a disk and memory. Why not leverage them before making that network call?</p> <p>The architecture is inspired by Bitcask, append-only writes with in-memory indexes pointing to exact file locations. O(1) lookups, no network overhead, just direct disk access. TTL support handles expiration automatically.</p> <p>The project is still in development. Right now it handles writing to disk reliably, but I&#39;m gradually adding recovery mechanisms, hint files for index persistence, and compaction.</p> <p>The code is open source: <a href="https://github.com/iamNilotpal/ignite">https://github.com/iamNilotpal/ignite</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lml2j3/a_bitcask_inspired_local_disk_cache_for_avoiding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lml2j3/a_bitcask_inspired_local_disk_cache_for_avoiding/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Swaggo applies this approach, but it doesn&#39;t always work. In reality, things change. I started with a clean API spec, but once business needs shift, that spec becomes outdated fast.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m proud to announce that after over a year of development my FieldX crate is sufficiently stabilized to move onto <a href="https://vrurg.github.io/fieldx/release-notes/v0.2.0.html">the next minor version</a>!</p> <p>What is it? I wasn&#39;t sure how to classify the crate and worked out a definition that is the best match so far: an object manager. Its purpose is, given a struct, to implement the boilerplate needed to provide some most used APIs. More details are in <a href="https://vrurg.github.io/fieldx/introduction.html">the introduction chapter</a> of FieldX documentation, but to mention a few, briefly: accessors and setters, lazy field initialization, builder pattern, serialization, etc. Depending on user requirements the crate supports all concurrency modes: plain (or unsync), sync, async. </p> <p>I wasn&#39;t targeting any particular use cases. A while ago someone asked me if this is about dependency injection (referring to the laziness), and I didn&#39;t have an answer back then. Now I can tell that FieldX can be used to implement a dependency manager; other way around, the inner dependency injection pattern is what one gets with the lazy field initialization. But this is only part of the story as FieldX works well for any kind of general application development and, hopefully, not only. At least it is based upon the experiences I had while working on other projects.</p> <p>But first of all, I hope that the crate would spare hours of tedious boilerplate implementation to many fellow devs!</p> <p>PS. If anyone could donate a good logo for the project I&#39;d appreciate this a lot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vrurg"> /u/vrurg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lmyrpj/fieldx_020_released/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lmyrpj/fieldx_020_released/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context I am a 22 year old guy, backend developer with golang stack, months away from being a software engineering graduate. I started studying very early on when I was 15 and I&#39;ve been working as a contractor since. Recently I decided to go for full time.</p> <p>A little disclaimer now: the intention of this post is to seek help from those more experienced on a field that is foreign to me, I by no means intend to bash on AI people nor I encourage you to do so. If something went missunderstood keep in mind english is not my native language.</p> <p>Did a couple of interviews, landed my first full time job in a month. They make me use AI on a daily basis. This altogether with constant AI apology, both inside and outside my job, in social media, in the uni, between peers and entrepreneurs... I am so sick of it...</p> <p>This made me reconsider my options... It feels like you either specialize on AI or go completely against it. Maybe today is a good day to leave the backend behind, and start to focus more on systems/embedded systems development. Rust and Zig seems very promessing, operating systems has always been my favorite subject at uni and I love linux with a passion.</p> <p>I am determined to find a way to scratch that itch of feeling like a real engineer, architect complex systems, break down the problem, carefully design components, and do it by hand... I dont want to instruct a machine in such a detailed way that it might be better idea to just go and code the thing.</p> <p>Here it comes the questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>¬øDoes anyone feel like me or am I just too young and inexperienced to see the whole picture?</p></li> <li><p>¬øWhat its like to be an actual full time rust engineer? (Or whatever low level related engineer)</p></li> <li><p>¬øDo you see this field being more resilient to the advances of AI?</p></li> <li><p>¬øIs it a good idea to start by reading a systems book of some sort? Should I start by learning C? Or is it better idea to learn Rust right away as it seems like so much fun (and pain)?</p></li> </ol> <p>Thank you for reading the whole testament that I wrote, any kind of advise will be well received, hope you have a great week!</p> <p>Edit: Thanks for the writing tips!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IthDev"> /u/IthDev </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lmw1y2/ai_should_i_change_career_path/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lmw1y2/ai_should_i_change_career_path/">[comments]</a></span></div>

This makes it possible to ship your templates with your application.</p> <p>Generally TUI applications come with some kind of config which lets you configure some aspect of the applications appearance, with Anathema this almost takes it one step further where you can change the entire layout instead, not just changing colours, and as a developer you don&#39;t have to add this behaviour, it&#39;s already provided by Anathema.</p> <p>It has hot reloading of templates so it&#39;s faster to iterate over designs when you don&#39;t have to recompile every time you change a template.</p> <p>The attached video isn&#39;t amazing at explaining anything in depth, it&#39;s just a means to scratch the surface and show you a bit of what can be done.</p> <p>Here are some relevant links:</p> <ul> <li>Git: <a href="https://github.com/togglebyte/anathema/">https://github.com/togglebyte/anathema/</a></li> <li>The Guide: <a href="https://togglebyte.github.io/anathema-guide/">https://togglebyte.github.io/anathema-guide/</a></li> <li>Live stream (next will be on Monday around 8 am UTC): <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit/">https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit/</a></li> </ul> <p>Applications where Anathema is not a good fit (right now at least):</p> <ul> <li>Writing your next <code>ls</code> replacement: Anathema takes over the entire screen. This is something that will change in the future with a different backend.</li> <li>Dynamic layouts like splitting views during runtime, so it&#39;s not a good choice for your next Vim clone or terminal multiplexer (this will be looked into at some point though)</li> <li>You don&#39;t care about TUIs at all and you want a GUI (I played around with the idea of giving this a graphical backend written in WGPU at one point!)</li> <li>Probably some other reasons</li> </ul> <p>There are also various optimisations on my TODO list that hasn&#39;t made it into the GitHub issues just yet.</p> <p>I personally use this for a few applications so a bit of dogfooding done.</p> <p>I&#39;ve included some questions I&#39;ve gotten over time as I developed this.</p> <p>FAQ + an opinion:</p> <p>Q: Why does Anathema not have an input widget<br/> A: It does via anathema-extras, a crate that will have more custom components added to it over time</p> <p>Q: I don&#39;t like white-space aware languages<br/> A: Some people do, some people don&#39;t, it&#39;s a matter of opinion. I don&#39;t like touching raw chicken.</p> <p>Q: What&#39;s with the name<br/> A: It&#39;s a play on words (curses and ncurses)</p> <p>Q: I use Vim (and Arch btw) is there syntax highlighting for AML?<br/> A: Yes there is, checkout <a href="https://github.com/togglebyte/aml.vim">https://github.com/togglebyte/aml.vim</a> (it&#39;s a bit sparse)</p> <p>Q: Is there a forum or a Discord where I can get help with Anathema?<br/> A: There isn&#39;t an official one yet but I do answer questions and offer help during my live streams over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit/">https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit/</a> so feel free to join the chat and ask there. I am also happy to demonstrate features during these streams.</p> <p>Q: I found a bug what do I do?<br/> A: Don&#39;t tell anyone!! Okay fine, you can tell me. Open an issue on GitHub and try to provide as much information as possible on how to replicate it.</p> <p>Q: Is Anathema ready for production?<br/> A: I can&#39;t really answer that as I don&#39;t know what level of bugs you can tolerate in production. I use it for various things and it works fine.</p> <p>Q: I don&#39;t like you or your opinions!<br/> A: Nice try wife, get off Reddit and feed the bunny!</p> <p>Q: Do you really have a bunny?<br/> A: Yes, his name is Nonsense, he roams freely in our house and he is a champ!</p> <p>There is so much more I want to say but this is already a long post and I&#39;m hungry.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/toggledbit"> /u/toggledbit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://youtu.be/WmF1f5wWPRE">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1lmp3m2/announcing_anathema_a_tui_library_with_a/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For those who are unfamiliar: <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs">Are We Game Yet?</a> is a community-sourced database of Rust gamedev projects/resources, which has been running for over eight years now (?!).</p> <p>For the first time in a while, the site has had some quality-of-life upgrades over the past few weeks, so I thought I&#39;d do a quick announcement post:</p> <ul> <li><strong>You can now sort the crate lists by various categories, such as recent downloads or GitHub stars.</strong> This has been requested for a long time, and I think it makes the site much more useful as a comparison tool!</li> <li><strong>We now display the last activity date for Git repos, so you can see at a glance how active development is.</strong> Thank you to ZimboPro for their contributions towards this.</li> <li><strong>The site is now more accessible to screen readers.</strong> Previously, they were unable to read any of the badges on the crates, as they were displayed via embedded images.</li> <li><strong>Repos that get archived on GitHub will now be automatically moved to the archive section of the site.</strong> Thank you to AngelOnFira for building the automation for this!</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;d also like to give a reminder that Are We Game Yet? is <a href="https://github.com/rust-gamedev/arewegameyet">open source</a>, and we rely on the community&#39;s contributions to keep the site up to date with what&#39;s happening in the Rust gamedev ecosystem (I myself haven&#39;t had as much time as I&#39;d like for gamedev lately, so I&#39;ll admit to being a bit out of the loop)!</p> <p>Whether it&#39;s by helping us with the site&#39;s development, <a href="https://github.com/rust-gamedev/arewegameyet?tab=readme-ov-file#contribute">raising PRs to add new crates to the database</a>, or just by creating an issue to tell us about something we&#39;re missing, any contribution is very much appreciated üòä</p> <p>We&#39;d also welcome any feedback on the new features, or suggestions for changes that would make the site more useful to you.</p> <p><em>Crossposted to URLO</em> <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/are-we-game-yet-new-features-call-for-contributions/124760"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/seventeencups"> /u/seventeencups </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ic8n61/are_we_game_yet_new_featurescall_for_contributions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ic8n61/are_we_game_yet_new_featurescall_for_contributions/">[comments]</a></span></div>
