Similar to Spu7nix&#39;s SPWN, but one that uses the new 2.2 triggers (also SPWN is deprecated but that&#39;s besides the point). The result is on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ArrowSlashArrow/tasm-lang">https://github.com/ArrowSlashArrow/tasm-lang</a> . This language is a primitive assembly-like language intended mainly for computational uses.</p> <p>During its development, I encountered serious struggles deciphering the GD savefile format, and getting it right. I then realised that other people might also want to interface in the same way, and not go through the same struggle. Shortly thereafter, I started the development of GDLib, a crate in rust that aims to solve this issue and also provide an API for other GD-related actions.</p> <p>Currently, the library is in v0.2.3, and is missing a lot of the planned features; the roadmap will be posted in the repo soon. The development is also not the fastest thing in the world, so if you would like to help out. Repo link: <a href="https://github.com/ArrowSlashArrow/gdlib">https://github.com/ArrowSlashArrow/gdlib</a></p> <p>Features of GDLib as of right now:</p> <ul> <li>Ability to read and write to CCLocalLevels.dat</li> <li>Ability to create and modify levels</li> <li>Limited objects api: about 30% of the triggers, the default block, and the text object</li> <li>Unused/used group indexer for levels</li> <li>Can be somewhat slow</li> </ul> <p>Feel free to leave any suggestions and/or give feedback! all that is much appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Quiet-Ad3191"> /u/Quiet-Ad3191 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o45nsw/wip_api_library_for_geometry_dash_gdlib/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o45nsw/wip_api_library_for_geometry_dash_gdlib/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>jlrs is a crate for the Rust programming language for interop between Rust and Julia, version 0.22 brings many changes. The tutorial has been updated to this new version.</p> <h3>Version and juliaup support</h3> <p>Julia versions 1.10 up to and including 1.12 are supported. The MSRV is 1.85, the codebase has been migrated to the 2024 edition of Rust. Unlike previous versions the targeted Julia version is now detected at build time, all version features (e.g. <code>julia-1-10</code>) have been removed. The old <code>JULIA_DIR</code> environment variable has been renamed to <code>JLRS_JULIA_DIR</code>.</p> <p>Using jlrs with juliaup has long been unsupported, but is now possible by installing <code>jlrs-launcher</code>. This application uses juliaup internally to find the requested Julia version; by invoking <code>jlrs-launcher +1.12 cargo run</code>, <code>cargo run</code> is executed in a new process where the environment has been updated to allow the version to be detected and the library to be linked.</p> <p>The JlrsCore package is used internally by jlrs, the specific version that is used can be overridden with the environment variables <code>JLRS_CORE_REVISION</code>, <code>JLRS_CORE_REPO</code>, <code>JLRS_CORE_VERSION</code> and <code>JLRS_CORE_NO_INSTALL</code>.</p> <h3>Async runtime</h3> <p>The async runtime has been updated to support, and in some cases require, async closures. Async closures that take an <code>AsyncGcFrame</code> implement the <code>AsyncTask</code>-trait. The <code>async_scope</code> method requires an async closure to be used instead of a closure that returns an async block. Unsafe work-arounds for lifetime limitations of closure that return async blocks, like <code>relaxed_async_scope</code>, have been removed. </p> <p>Thanks to the stabilization of async methods in traits, traits with such methods no longer depend on <code>async_task</code>.</p> <h3>Weak types and targets</h3> <p>Unrooted data has long been called a <code>Ref</code> in jlrs, but this is a misnomer: there is no additional level of indirection, rather it&#39;s weakly instead of strongly referenced from Rust. Such data is now called <code>Weak</code>, types like <code>ValueRef</code> have been renamed to <code>WeakValue</code>. Similarly, unrooting targets have been renamed to weak targets.</p> <h3>Exported type derive macros</h3> <p>The <code>OpaqueType</code> and <code>ForeignType</code> traits, which are used to export Rust types to Julia, are now derive macros. The <code>ParametricBase</code> and <code>ParametricVariant</code> traits have been removed; <code>OpaqueType</code> now supports types with generics. Features like setting the super-type of an exported type are now handled by annotating the struct instead of implementing a trait method. A custom mark function for a <code>ForeignType</code> can be implemented by annotating the fields that reference Julia data or by implementing the <code>Mark</code> trait.</p> <h3>Scope generics</h3> <p>The previous version of jlrs moved the return type of a scope from the method to the trait. This was a bad choice and has been reverted. The unnameable generic type of the scope has been removed from the signature in favor of using <code>impl Trait</code>. The <code>Returning</code> and <code>LocalReturning</code> traits have been removed.</p> <h3>Calling Julia functions</h3> <p>Methods that call a function with a small number of arguments like <code>Call::call1</code> have been deprecated in favor of <code>Call::call</code>. Providing keyword arguments with <code>ProvideArguments::provide_arguments</code> has been deprecated in favor <code>Call::call_kw</code>. The keyword arguments must be provided as a <code>NamedTuple</code>. The managed <code>Function</code> type has been removed and replaced by an abstract type.</p> <h3>Other changes</h3> <p>The exception handler passed to <code>catch_exceptions</code> is now invoked inside the catch block. It takes an <code>Exception</code> instead of a <code>Value</code>.</p> <p>Arrays can no longer be index with tuples like <code>(1, 2)</code>, use arrays: <code>[1, 2]</code> instead.</p> <p>The <code>IntoJlrsResult</code> trait has been removed in favor of supporting the <code>?</code> operator.</p> <p>The multithreaded runtime can no longer be started but must be spawned. They require the use of scoped threads to ensure that the main thread outlives all adopted threads.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Taaitaaiger/jlrs">GitHub</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Taaitaaiger/jlrs-launcher">jlrs-launcher</a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.rs/jlrs/latest/jlrs">Docs</a></p> <p><a href="https://taaitaaiger.github.io/jlrs-tutorial">Tutorial</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Theemuts"> /u/Theemuts </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o3yyfh/jlrs_022_julia_version_autodetection_async/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o3yyfh/jlrs_022_julia_version_autodetection_async/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Migrations are in /migrations and sqlx picks these up directly.</p> <p>I now want to build a ledger as a crate (similar to gnuCash). This ledger crate needs to be independent yet also be dependent on sqlx. </p> <p>However if the parent project (let‚Äôs call it acme) has a dependency on the ledger crate, we will see ledger/migrations as well.</p> <p>(1) how does one sensibly develop the ledger crate whilst the host application is also worked on separately? I‚Äôm not sure if this possible as the host apps sqlx migrations are tracked in Postgres public schema (namespace)</p> <p>It might be possible to script and copy these across but‚Ä¶</p> <p>(2) issue above means the host app will have difficulty if any constraints are placed on migrations that are copied over due to migration order. Sqlx maintains order based on their timestamps. </p> <p>Overall goal: this is a hobby project and I am building a smaller version of a bookkeeping platform for myself. </p> <p>The Hexarch domain has - service layer - repository layer - Axum + JWT on an ‚Äúapp‚Äù user. Login works via a 2FA code. Right now this code is just output in tracing logs. It will be extended to be sent via email (todo). - domain crate is essentially the application layer with Semantic value types. - any calls from the service to repository convert accordingly to types used by sqlx for Postgres</p> <p>I also wrote a small article on semantic types for monetary use <a href="https://crustyengineer.com/blog/semantic-types-for-money-in-rust-with-fastnum/">https://crustyengineer.com/blog/semantic-types-for-money-in-rust-with-fastnum/</a></p> <p>In the app db‚Äôs public PG namespace we have - users - banks (platform seeded or added by admin) - user_bank_map // user adds ‚ÄúMy bank‚Äù, as a join. - investments // this table could have an owner_uuid as FK reference to the join table above.</p> <h1>Complexities</h1> <ul> <li>is this over complicated? I always prefer keeping this simple - with the caveat it needs to still be flexible for some degree of extensibility </li> <li>how we associate an investment from the CRUD setup above, which is just to driver a user dashboard. An app user will</li> <li>Add bank // they are connected via the join</li> <li>Click on the bank from a list and ‚ÄúAdd investment‚Äù. The DB can have investment types etc but these will be pre-seeded and admin configured.</li> </ul> <p>However, I am having trouble deciding on the best way to model the basic CRUD above to tying it into the ledger proposed. </p> <p>Another way to look at this - the frontend should have a Ledger admin area to create ledger accounts. - Assets - Liabilities - Equities </p> <p>Perhaps this is as simple as creating a join between investments and ledgers? - this seems wrong though as an investment is an Asset - Assets are only one type of ledger account. - when we create an investment on the CRUD side, what is the association with the ledger? A book?</p> <p>There‚Äôs confusion on my side between ledger / book / postings and journal entries / transactions. Confusing terminology from what I‚Äôve seen online.</p> <p>Right now I am reading a book on double balance accounting to better understand the nuances.</p> <p>‚Ä¶ similar to gnuCash</p> <p>You‚Äôve read this far - thanks! Looking forward to anyone with experience tackling something like this. </p> <p>I am happy to make the ledger aspect a public project if anyone is willing to pitch in.</p> <p>Also if any experts are keen on a short term project, minding I only have a limited budget, I‚Äôm open to this as well. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bsodmike"> /u/bsodmike </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o3u9kr/simple_hexarch_crate_for_ledger_system_advice_pls/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1o3u9kr/simple_hexarch_crate_for_ledger_system_advice_pls/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The player can write any word and hit enter to do damage if the word is in my list of all words (roughly) in the english language. The list is about 370K lines long, every line is a unique word. Here is the function that gets called every time the player hits enter:</p> <pre><code>func CheckWordList(word : String) -&gt; bool: #Word is the word the player typed var wordList = FileAccess.open(wordListPath, FileAccess.READ) #Gets the file with all words while not wordList.eof_reached(): #eof = end of file var line = wordList.get_line() #Gets current line if line: #Checks if the line exists if word.to_upper() == line.to_upper(): #Checks if word matches line CalculateDamage(word) #Deals damage wordList.close() #Closes the file return 1 wordList.close() #Closes the file after not finding a word return 0 </code></pre> <p>Keep in mind the function works as intended, but the game stops for a little under a second every time you hit enter, and stops for longer if your word is particularly far down in the list. Spamming enter completely stops the game way after you&#39;ve stopped pressing.</p> <p>What can I do about this? Is opening and closing the file every time costly or does that not matter? Is there a smarter way to go through the list? Is this even good practice?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><sup>To preface this, I&#39;ve done some research on moddability on this sub and beyond before, I&#39;m not asking about how to make something moddable; that&#39;s a different concern. For additional context: I&#39;ve been doing a retro project recently, so disk space is one of my primary concerns; I want the total game to be a few megabytes at most, and to load quickly with a small memory footprint. This necessitates a few otherwise unintuitive design choices, but not much that is relevant for this post.</sup></p> <hr/> <p>I&#39;ve recently been making my own hobby project more extensible/flexible/moddable/however you want to call it, and am now trying to see how I can make my project <em>easier to mod</em>, rather than just moddable, and part of that is making mods easier to make and distribute. My ideas so far: </p> <ul> <li>Inspired by Carmack&#39;s own ideas on extensibility, my current sub-project is making game content and assets be distributed in one unitary bundled file (naming it, say, <code>content.dat</code> or whatever), and then the game engine would load all the assets at once (scripts, images, audio, you name it) via that file. This would make distribution much easier, and there would be no need to fiddle with complex folder directory structures etc.</li> <li>This file would obviously be some type of archive, basically by definition. I don&#39;t want to repurpose <code>tar</code> for this because of its complexity, safety issues, etc. but the general principle (smash together multiple files into a binary stream and save it as a whole file, with some metadata to tell apart individual components) should be the same.</li> <li>Given that it&#39;s an archive, it could be simply compressed as a whole, reducing disk space, trading it off for in-memory decompression (RAM and CPU time). Depending on the encryption scheme used, this could also enable password protection, in case the authors (possibly including me) want their assets at least trivially protected.</li> <li>I would distribute the specs to this archive format and the tools used to create, modify and extract the archives, enabling others to create or modify game content</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m already loading all my assets from disk anyway, and it takes a bit of time to do that one by one; simply concatenating all the assets and loading them as one blob into memory, and then prying apart which part of the blob is which asset gave me a <em>huge</em> speedup, but it also makes for very brittle code and data. Developing a simple archive spec and the tools to manipulate it easily would also increase my own QoL as I develop the game, and from there it&#39;s easy to just distribute those tools as well.</p> <hr/> <p>I&#39;m already aware of some games and engines that do this or similar things, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Doom, which is what inspired me to look into making this a viable modding path</li> <li>Bethesda games</li> <li>Warcraft 3 custom maps and campaigns</li> </ul> <p>A few other very moddable games don&#39;t do this and instead load from &quot;loose&quot; directory structures or even rely on overwriting, including:</p> <ul> <li>Paradox games</li> <li>older Dwarf Fortress (you&#39;d paste mod files over your vanilla game files)</li> <li>Rimworld</li> </ul> <p>These are probably just easier to edit quickly, but then may make distribution and installation a bit of a chore (instead of downloading just one or two files, you&#39;re downloading a loose folder you have to extract and place in the right location). <sup>In my case, they&#39;re also noticeably slower to load, though that&#39;s just my weird target being problematic, and slightly larger in size due to disk block minimums, but that one&#39;s a natural result of using block storage media in general</sup></p> <hr/> <p>That aside, lots of games distribute the tools used to develop them, and some go as far as to provide documentation on top of that to enable modification. Grim Dawn comes with extensive game editing tools, for example, and Bethesda&#39;s creation kits are probably a large factor in why the games have remained popular. I&#39;m of course not going to realistically make anything of that scope, but a set of robust tools for development external to the game core itself will make things easier.</p> <p>On the other hand, even if tools are not available and the game is not easily moddable, people <em>have</em> figured out ways (e.g. Mono code injection like via BepInEx, or even more amazingly the .dll hook method Antibirth used for Binding of Isaac), but there&#39;s no reason to make it much more difficult to change things. </p> <p>I&#39;m under no illusion that I&#39;m not going to be the next idSoft or Bethesda or Bay 12 Games with this (if I ever finish it, I&#39;ll be lucky to have even a handful of people try it out), but it feels like it&#39;s my responsibility to let people play with it as much as possible at all skill levels (and not just giving them the source code and telling them to have at it).</p> <hr/> <p>What&#39;s your take on the dilemma? What pros and cons do you see in the two mod distribution methods outlined above (or the gradient between them)? What&#39;s your take on releasing your dev tools, assuming your engine or workflow support this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Swampspear"> /u/Swampspear </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o46l8k/packing_and_distributing_mods_and_mod_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1o46l8k/packing_and_distributing_mods_and_mod_tools/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I certainly suck at marketing and the game is probably just too generic to draw much attention by itself.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently been trying to tidy up my Go application by creating a package that contains functions for creating responses, particularly error responses. I&#39;m unsure if what I&#39;m doing is the idiomatic way and was wondering how everyone else handles this.</p> <p>For context, I&#39;m using the <a href="https://github.com/labstack/echo">echo framework</a>. This is a snippet from my response package including how I create a <code>415</code> and <code>422</code>:</p> <p>``<code>go // baseError represents a generic JSON error response. // Extras are merged into the JSON output. type baseError struct { Title string</code>json:&quot;title&quot;<code> Message string</code>json:&quot;message&quot;<code> Extras map[string]interface{}</code>json:&quot;-&quot;` // Optional additional fields }</p> <p>// MarshalJSON merges Extras into the JSON serialization. func (e baseError) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) { base := map[string]interface{}{ &quot;title&quot;: e.Title, &quot;message&quot;: e.Message, }</p> <p>for k, v := range e.Extras { base[k] = v } return json.Marshal(base) }</p> <p>// UnsupportedMediaType returns a 415 Unsupported Media Type response func UnsupportedMediaType(c echo.Context, message string, acceptedTypes []string, acceptedEncodings []string) *echo.HTTPError {</p> <p>if len(acceptedTypes) &gt; 0 {</p> <pre><code>// PATCH requests should use the Accept-Patch header instead of Accept when // returning a list of supported media types if c.Request().Method == http.MethodPatch { c.Response().Header().Set(headers.AcceptPatch, strings.Join(acceptedTypes, &quot;, &quot;)) } else { c.Response().Header().Set(headers.Accept, strings.Join(acceptedTypes, &quot;, &quot;)) } </code></pre> <p>}</p> <p>if len(acceptedEncodings) &gt; 0 { c.Response().Header().Set(headers.AcceptEncoding, strings.Join(acceptedEncodings, &quot;, &quot;)) }</p> <p>return &amp;echo.HTTPError{ Code: http.StatusUnsupportedMediaType, Message: baseError{ Title: &quot;Unsupported Media Type&quot;, Message: message, }, } }</p> <p>// ValidationError describes a single validation error within a 422 Unprocessable Content response. type ValidationError struct { Message string <code>json:&quot;message,omitempty&quot;</code> // Explanation of the failure Location string <code>json:&quot;location,omitempty&quot;</code> // &quot;body&quot;|&quot;query&quot;|&quot;path&quot;|&quot;header&quot; Name string <code>json:&quot;name,omitempty&quot;</code> // Invalid / missing request body field, query param, or header name }</p> <p>// UnprocessableContent returns a 422 Unprocessable Content error response. // It contains a slice of ValidationError structs, detailing invalid or missing // request fields and their associated errors. func UnprocessableContent(c echo.Context, message string, errors []ValidationError) *echo.HTTPError { return &amp;echo.HTTPError{ Code: http.StatusUnprocessableEntity, Message: baseError{ Title: &quot;Invalid request&quot;, Message: message, Extras: map[string]interface{}{ &quot;errors&quot;: errors, }, }, } } ```</p> <p>I was curious if this would be considered a good approach or if there&#39;s a better way to go about it.</p> <p>Thank you in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mo0nman_"> /u/mo0nman_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o3oqmy/idiomatic_way_to_standardize_http_response_bodies/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o3oqmy/idiomatic_way_to_standardize_http_response_bodies/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I been working for over 6 months as Go developer, I just realized in a course something called Padding which I found really interesting. In the examples the instructor mentioned, he just use examples like </p> <p>```go // Struct with padding type WithPadding struct { A byte // 1 byte B int32 // 4 bytes C byte // 1 byte }</p> <p>// Struct without padding (optimized field order) type WithoutPadding struct { A byte // 1 byte C byte // 1 byte B int32 // 4 bytes } ```</p> <p>The thing is, can I apply this kinda optimization in business structs like an entity that has as field other entities (composition) and the former also have fields like slices or maps? Hope the question is clear enough, plus what are other ways to optimize my go code apart from profiling tools? Where can I find resources to learn more about low level go so I get to be a mechanical sympathizer with go compiler </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HoneyResponsible8868"> /u/HoneyResponsible8868 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o3m3y1/padding/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1o3m3y1/padding/">[comments]</a></span></div>
