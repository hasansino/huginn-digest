However, due to financial and geographical difficulties I never went to college. I am in the ATX area and my brother broke into the games industry a few years back with no degree. He is now working for Bethesda. </p> <p>A few years back his first game dev company would hire a lot of people in the ATX area for QA remotely. This was his first job in gaming also. I got an interview that was a failure due to technical difficulties and someone else was hired. At this point circa late 2022, they had a hiring spree roughly every other quarter. I had hoped I would get my second chance. That same company soon after laid off almost there entire U.S. studios and HQ and have never rehired since early 2023. They only hire in UK and CA now despite being headquartered in ATX. </p> <p>My question is, is it really just all doom and gloom and will I ever have my chance again? With the recent Meta layoffs, and massive Microsoft, other company layoffs in 2023-2025 it seems pointless. </p> <p>My focus is really making my own projects for free and potentially getting into something before I’m too old.</p> <p>Any advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JimmyTwoTimes98"> /u/JimmyTwoTimes98 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdvdgk/likelihood_of_the_industry_ever_opening_to_entry/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdvdgk/likelihood_of_the_industry_ever_opening_to_entry/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Posting this in case it saves someone else a lot of time.</p> <p>We were uploading an <strong>unreleased Unity demo</strong> to Steamworks and repeatedly ran into the <em>“Missing game executable”</em> error — but only <strong>after</strong> we sent keys out to external testers.</p> <p>What made this particularly confusing is that <strong>everything worked fine on our own machines</strong>. Because our Steam accounts were directly linked to Steamworks, the demo launched without issue internally. The problem only surfaced once keys were used on accounts <em>not</em> tied to the project.</p> <p>From our side, everything looked correct:</p> <ul> <li>depot uploaded successfully</li> <li>correct branch selected</li> <li>launch options pointing at an existing EXE</li> <li>build running locally</li> </ul> <p>The underlying issue was still an <strong>EXE name mismatch</strong>, but changing launch options alone didn’t reliably resolve it.</p> <p>In our case:</p> <ul> <li>Steam expected: <code>SUB_SPECIES_DEMO.exe</code></li> <li>The uploaded build contained: <code>Sub_Species_Steam_Demo.exe</code></li> </ul> <p>Even after updating launch options, Steam continued reporting a missing executable until we did a <strong>full rebuild and depot re-upload</strong> with the EXE renamed at the Unity build level.</p> <p>Things that <em>did not</em> reliably fix it on their own:</p> <ul> <li>changing launch options without rebuilding</li> <li>re-uploading without changing the EXE name</li> <li>restarting Steam</li> <li>clearing download cache</li> </ul> <p>What finally worked:</p> <ul> <li>rebuilding the Unity project with the <strong>exact EXE name Steam expected</strong></li> <li>uploading that as a fresh depot</li> <li>deleting the local <code>appmanifest_*.acf</code> to force Steam to fully re-pull the build</li> </ul> <p>The biggest takeaway for us was that <strong>Steamworks-linked accounts can mask this issue completely</strong>, so it’s worth testing demo keys on an external account before sending anything out.</p> <p>Hopefully this helps someone avoid a very stressful round of last-minute debugging.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HowlingHamster"> /u/HowlingHamster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdtry5/psa_steam_missing_game_executable_can_stay_hidden/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdtry5/psa_steam_missing_game_executable_can_stay_hidden/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I should first caveat this post by saying that I understand the game development reasons behind why this problem exists and no, I don&#39;t really know how to fix it.</p> <p>As both someone who plays a lot of post apocalyptic games (Day Z, 7 Days to Die, Project Zomboid, etc) and who would someday like to make one, I have a minor pet peeve with the concept of manufactured scarcity.</p> <p>I get it. Part of the fun of these games is scrabbling to find materials for crafting etc. But it kind of breaks immersion when I&#39;m literally standing in a forest surrounded by trees but none of them are the &quot;special&quot; trees that I can harvest wood from. Or I&#39;m standing inside an entire mostly intact house and yet can&#39;t scavenge any wood or metal or anything at all from it. I can be freezing to death and am literally surrounded by easily collected wood (doors, furniture, etc) but somehow can&#39;t use any of it to feed my fire.</p> <p>And yeah, as I said, I don&#39;t have an answer for the problem. Realistically, in a post apocalyptic modern world, scarcity of materials wouldn&#39;t be a thing. But that&#39;s not really all that fun is it. I&#39;d like to find a middle ground though between infinite basic materials and standing in an entire furnished, wooden building and only being able to scavenge one torn piece of paper.</p> <p>Anybody have suggestions for how to handle this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/game_enthusiast_60"> /u/game_enthusiast_60 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdt4rb/fake_scarcity_in_postapocalyptic_games/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdt4rb/fake_scarcity_in_postapocalyptic_games/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been developing a small game for the last couple of months in my freetime. I use git (github) for version control. Working on it alone, I only needed the most basic stuff from git, like pushing and branching.</p> <p>Now a friend from work who is an artist joined me, which is great, because I very much suck at art. However this makes it necessary to find a way for him to share his work with me. He does not have any knowledge about git or version-control in general and my own knowledge is very limited as well.</p> <p>Now I wonder what would be the best way to set up my project for us so that he can easily contribute his files. At the moment I see two routes:</p> <p>1.) Git</p> <p>Learn more about git and create a seperate „art“ or „asset“ branch where he can push to and show him the basics of version control, maybe via Github-Desktops or something similar. Going down this route I would like to now if there is a way to limit the actions that my artist can do with git, maybe something along the lines of him only being able to change files in specific folders. If yes, what are some git-keywords that I can research for stuff like that? Also, can you recommend any programs for simple git usage like Github-Desktop, that are userfriendly and make the most basic stuff easy to understand on Mac and Windows?</p> <p>2.) No Git</p> <p>Not have him use version-control, but set up a Dropbox or something that is easy to use for him and where he does not need to learn the basics of git. However last time I checked, Dorpbox is not free. So I wonder are there any free tools like Dropbox that we could use?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joe_Hazelnut"> /u/Joe_Hazelnut </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdfq1z/suddenly_working_with_an_artist_how_to_version/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1qdfq1z/suddenly_working_with_an_artist_how_to_version/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Many of the most popular providers are already supported, but more are needed. To this end I&#39;d like to crowd-source contributions of additional providers; contributing a new provider is relatively straight-forward and much of the code and testing is macro-generated.</p> <p><strong>Why</strong></p> <p>This matters because it enables DNS-based certificate generation with ACME providers i.e. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> and others. Used in conjunction with crates like <a href="https://github.com/djc/instant-acme">instant-acme</a> this enables TLS behind the firewall. For practical examples it in use it&#39;s already in a couple of (my own) projects:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/tarka/vicarian">Vicarian</a>, a TLS-first reverse proxy with DNS-01 support.</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tarka/netlink-ddns/">netlink-ddns</a>, a small DDNS updater for Linux gateways.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately most providers don&#39;t have sandbox instances, so development and testing often requires a hosted domain. If you have a domain with provider that isn&#39;t on the <a href="https://github.com/tarka/zone-update/blob/main/docs/PROVIDERS.md">supported list</a> adding it is relatively straight-forward. </p> <p>zone-update is built with portability in mind; it has blocking and async APIs, and is tested against multiple async runtimes on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p> <p>Of course other contributions are welcome, including (constructive) feedback and additional testing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TarkaSteve"> /u/TarkaSteve </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qe158h/zoneupdate_dns_library_call_for_contributions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qe158h/zoneupdate_dns_library_call_for_contributions/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I wrote a small Rust library called Gate0 to explore what guarantees are realistically enforceable in authorization logic when you deliberately keep the scope tight.</p> <p>I originally built it to replace a small ad hoc auth check in another project but I ended up going much deeper into bounds and failure modes than I expected.</p> <p>The goal was not to build a framework or a new DSL. It’s a minimal core that answers one question:</p> <p>fn evaluate(principal, action, resource, context) -&gt; Result&lt;Decision&gt;</p> <p>I intentionally optimized for auditability and correctness over flexibility. To be clear, this is about zero allocations during evaluation, not the entire crate never allocates.</p> <p>Some of the constraints I enforced:</p> <ol> <li>Zero dependencies (pure <code>std</code>,no macros, no build scripts).</li> <li>No heap allocations at request time. The evaluator uses fixed-size, stack-allocated buffers implemented with MaybeUninit.</li> <li>Bounded evaluation everywhere. Rule count, condition depth, context size, and string lengths are all capped during construction.</li> <li>Non-recursive by design. Validation, evaluation, and even <code>Drop</code> are implemented with manual stacks to avoid stack overflows.</li> <li>Deterministic behavior. Rules are evaluated in a fixed order with a strict deny-overrides strategy.</li> <li>Panic-free core. No unwrap<code>()</code>, expect<code>()</code>or panics everything returns Result.</li> </ol> <p><strong><em>About the zero-allocation</em></strong></p> <p>I intentionally optimized for auditability and correctness over flexibility. To be clear, the zero-allocation guarantee applies to request-time evaluation, not policy construction.</p> <ul> <li>The traversal stack is bounded at <code>2 *</code> depth <code>+ 2</code>.</li> <li>The value stack is bounded at depth <code>+ 2</code>.</li> </ul> <p>With a hard cap of <strong>ABSOLUTE_MAX_CONDITION_DEPTH = 16</strong>, this gives fixed stack sizes that can be expressed with const generics. Configs that exceed this cap are rejected outright (not clamped).</p> <p>To sanity-check myself, I verified this mechanically:</p> <p>-There’s a tests/allocations.rs file that installs a counting global allocator.</p> <p>-Each decision path (Allow/ Deny/ NoMatch/Condition) is executed 1,000 times and asserts that allocation count remains zero</p> <p>This is not meant to compete with systems like OPA/Cedar. It’s closer to a defensive building block you’d embed inside a larger system when you care about very small attack surface, predictable latency (no allocator jitter) and logic that can realistically be reviewed by a human.</p> <p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Qarait/gate0">https://github.com/Qarait/gate0</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Antiqueempire"> /u/Antiqueempire </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qdx73y/gate0_a_zeroallocation_deterministic_micropolicy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1qdx73y/gate0_a_zeroallocation_deterministic_micropolicy/">[comments]</a></span></div>

By unifying CPU and GPU kernels through CubeCL, we’ve managed to squeeze maximum efficiency out of everything from NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to standard consumer CPUs.</p> <p><strong>CubeCL CPU Overhaul</strong></p> <p>The CubeCL CPU backend received a major update. It now features proper lazy execution and the same multi-stream support as our WGPU runtime. We’ve also added support for kernel fusion, which was a missing piece in our previous CPU backends. In addition, by focusing on cache line alignment and memory coalescing, our kernels are now outperforming established libraries like libtorch in several benchmarks. </p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/b0f5dvxgejdg1.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37ffb43aee40e14eafb6d54f3b0e36a5c285b21c">CubeCL achieves up to a 4x speedup over LibTorch CPU, with even larger margins compared to SIMD-enabled ndarray.</a></p> <p>The real win here is that CubeCL kernels are designed to adapt their computation based on launch arguments. By selecting the optimal line size (vectorization), cube dimensions, and cube counts specifically for the CPU, we can control exactly how threads map to data without touching the kernel code. We increased the line size to ensure optimal SIMD vectorization and tuned the cube settings so that data ranges respect physical cache line boundaries. This automatically eliminates cache contention, preventing multiple cores from fighting over the same memory segments, and keeps the underlying logic fully portable and optimal across both GPU and CPU. </p> <p><strong>Blackwell Optimization</strong></p> <p>On the high-end GPU side, this release adds support for the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) and inlined PTX for manual Matrix-Multiply Accumulate (MMA) instructions. This allows us to get closer to the theoretical peak of modern silicon. We’ve adapted our matmul engine to combine TMA with warp specialization, specifically targeting Blackwell-based hardware like the RTX 5090. These improvements also benefit NVIDIA’s Ada and Hopper architectures. New benchmarks show our kernels reaching state-of-the-art performance, matching the industry-standard CUTLASS and cuBLAS libraries found in LibTorch.</p> <p>This release also packs several other enhancements, ranging from zero-copy weight loading to a more streamlined training API. For a deep dive into all the new features and performance gains, check out the full release post here: <a href="https://burn.dev/blog/release-0.20.0/">https://burn.dev/blog/release-0.20.0/</a> </p> <p>We’re excited to see what you build with these new capabilities.

I was running this on my home hardware (Mac Mini M1 + older MacBooks), and Python&#39;s memory overhead + GC pauses were killing the process. I was getting OOM kills constantly, and throughput was stuck at ~20 messages/sec.</p> <p>I decided to port the ingestion and classification pipeline to Rust. The difference was night and day.</p> <p><strong>The Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ingestion:</strong> Custom Rust ingestor reading <code>.zst</code> streams.</li> <li><strong>Queue:</strong> Redis (via <code>redis-rs</code>) to decouple producers/consumers.</li> <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Ported from PyTorch to <strong>ONNX Runtime (ORT)</strong> in Rust.</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Polars + Parquet (instead of Postgres rows).</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Results:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Memory usage dropped from &gt;1GB (swelling) to stable &lt;500MB per worker.</li> <li>Throughput went from 20 msg/sec to ~300+ msg/sec on the same hardware.</li> <li>The ONNX implementation in Rust was significantly faster and lighter than the Python equivalent.</li> </ul> <p>I wrote a detailed blog post about the architecture, the memory struggles, and the specific Rust implementations I used.</p> <p><strong>Read the full write-up here:</strong> <a href="https://teo-miscia.medium.com/i-built-a-saas-idea-generator-by-analyzing-the-entirety-of-reddit-2025-9de42bcddb27">https://teo-miscia.medium.com/i-built-a-saas-idea-generator-by-analyzing-the-entirety-of-reddit-2025-9de42bcddb27</a></p> <p>If you&#39;re a data engineer struggling with Python at scale, I highly recommend looking into Rust + ONNX.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am an open source contributor, working on load balancing for Bifrost (LLM gateway) and ran into some interesting challenges with Go implementation.</p> <p>Standard weighted round-robin works fine for static loads, but LLM providers behave weirdly. OpenAI might be fast at 9am, slow at 2pm. Azure rate limits kick in unexpectedly. One region degrades while others stay healthy.</p> <p>Built adaptive routing that adjusts weights based on live metrics - latency, error rates, throughput. Used EWMAs (exponentially weighted moving averages) to smooth out spikes without overreacting to noise.</p> <p>The Go part that was tricky: tracking per-provider metrics without locks becoming a bottleneck at high RPS. Ended up using atomic operations for counters and a separate goroutine that periodically reads metrics and recalculates weights. Keeps the hot path lock-free.</p> <p>Also had to handle provider health scoring. Not just &quot;up or down&quot; but scoring based on recent performance. A provider recovering from issues should gradually earn traffic back, not get slammed immediately.</p> <p>Connection pooling matters more than expected. Go&#39;s http.Transport reuses connections well, but tuning MaxIdleConnsPerHost made a noticeable difference under sustained load.</p> <p>Running this at 5K RPS with sub-microsecond overhead now. The concurrency primitives in Go made this way easier than Python would&#39;ve been.</p> <p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost">https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost</a></p> <p>Anyone else built adaptive routing in Go?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently reading Learning Go (2nd edit) by Jon Bodner and I&#39;m trying to understand the use case for closures.</p> <p>In chapter 5, there is an example called <a href="https://github.com/learning-go-book-2e/ch05/blob/main/sample_code/defer_db/defer_db.go">defer_db</a> and on line 15, the return of tx.Commit is assigned to err. But since defer runs after the return, there is no way the user ever sees the error, right? If the function returned <code>nil</code> on line 26, how should an error on Commit be handled?</p> <p>I find closures still confusing because it feels weird that a function is supposed to modify a variable from a higher scope. Why not pass in the variable as a parameter and return the modified value?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Nectarine8036"> /u/No-Nectarine8036 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qdenkx/learn_go_closures/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1qdenkx/learn_go_closures/">[comments]</a></span></div>
