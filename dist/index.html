            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just tagged a big release for Bob. The main highlight is that all of the code generation now depend on plugins which can all be disabled.</p> <p>By doing things this way, Bob is free to add more helpful code generation plugins which users can opt out of.</p> <p>Here is the list of the built-in plugins:</p> <ul> <li><code>dbinfo</code>: Generates code for information about each database. Schemas, tables, columns, indexes, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.</li> <li><code>enums</code>: Generates code for enums in a separate package, if there are any present.</li> <li><code>models</code>: Generates code for models. Depends on <code>enums</code>.</li> <li><code>factory</code>: Generates code for factories. Depends on <code>models</code>.</li> <li><code>dberrors</code>: Generates code for unique constraint errors. Depends on <code>models</code>.</li> <li><code>where</code>: Generates type-safe code for <code>WHERE</code> clauses in queries. Depends on <code>models</code>.</li> <li><code>loaders</code>: Adds templates to the <code>models</code> package to generate code for loaders e.g <code>models.SelectThenLoad.Table.Rel()</code>.</li> <li><code>joins</code>: Adds templates to the <code>models</code> package to generate code for joins e.g <code>models.SelectJoin.Table.LeftJoin.Rel</code>.</li> <li><code>queries</code>: Generates code for queries.</li> </ul> <p>This also shows what is possible with plugins.</p> <h1>Call to action</h1> <p>There are many potential plugins that could be created for Bob. I would love for others to create their own plugins and share. I already have ideas for potential plugins</p> <ul> <li>A plugin to generate protobuf definitions of table</li> <li>A plugin to generate code for an admin dashboard (similar to Django Admin)</li> <li>A plugin to generate CRUD endpoints for each table</li> <li>A plugin to generate a diagram (mermaid? graphviz?) of the database structure</li> </ul> <p>There is so much potential. Bob will provide all the information about the database. Table, columns, types, indexes, constraints.</p> <p>If there is a plugin you&#39;d like to create that is impossible due to Bob&#39;s design, let me know and I&#39;ll see how best to make it possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/StephenAfamO"> /u/StephenAfamO </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mpk6xk/bob_v0400_modular_code_generation_for_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1mpk6xk/bob_v0400_modular_code_generation_for_your/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For context, I&#39;ve been working on a RPG game for 7 years now (longer unnoficially), this is a world I&#39;ve escaped in since I was a child and is a labor of love. This game is what I&#39;m going to leave behind because according to doctors, It&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;m making it past the age of 45. This is all I have, this is what it means to me. Sorry for the upcoming hefty text, a big part of it is me venting cause I have no friends.</p> <p>I found my first artist on Deviant Art, his portfolio was polished, his art told stories and he had experience working for a chinese company that mass produced artwork. He quickly connected cause he was craving to quit his job to work on real projects with people who would appreciate his name. Fast forward, we signed a contract I showed him everything about my project, we agreed on 20,000$ which I VERY FOOLISHLY accepted to pay in advance. Side note, those were my savings, I haven&#39;t done financially well in a long time due to hardship.</p> <p>He started doing the work, it was amazing, but within a month he started slowing down... and the quality of his artwork was nowhere near what he started with. It went from amazing linework, to something a beginner would draw in illustrator it made no sense. When I told him that won&#39;t work, he asked for more money. He said my expectations were too high (which I never hid from the start), that my game was too much work and he would only continue if I paid another 20,000... that was a month in and he didn&#39;t deliver enough work to get that money&#39;s worth yet, even. </p> <p>So yeah, I realized I was getting pushed around, getting scammed at that point too. He started gazlighting me and would use nasty personal attacks when I tried to make things right, wished I would shut up and die... then he blocked me everywhere until I threatened to sue... but he&#39;s in Thailand and yeah, that just got more complicated cause after that he ghosted me.</p> <p>That was an expensive lesson, it demoralized me for an entire year - I barely touched my project during that time.</p> <p>Then I dug myself out of my hole and knew I&#39;m betraying myself if I don&#39;t keep going. I went out and hunted for another artist, this time much more dilligently, I went as far as talk to the people who hired them before to see how that went. Looked at their social media, demanded an interview, and so on. I&#39;ve learned my lesson.</p> <p>Then I find my new (current) artist, he has a good reputation, he&#39;s super pleasant to speak with, he&#39;s connected with his art, he has a beautifully distinctive style that is very close to my vision, we immediately got along and started to discuss everything.</p> <p>I know I needed a full time artist at this point, or someone who can contribute several hours weekly on my game to fully skin it. Then he asked me for 1,000$... I&#39;m like, ahead or in full? He went &quot;full&quot;, he loved my project so much, he thought it would succeed and that it could be his break. He wanted his name on the frontlines (aka Game by ME, Artist by HIM), and I was like absolutely but you need more money... like, those are my expectations weekly. Are you sure?</p> <p>He kept insisting that it was, and that he&#39;d just make money with all of his other clients (he did a lot of small jobs). We started working, and well... everything was great except that... he was being lazy about my project. Which was my fear when he insisted that 1,000$ was enough.</p> <p>Then brought back the conversation after a few months, he&#39;s barely done any finished artwork I could use. It was all sketches and it seemed he was struggling with consistency (like a character would have 3 holes on a belt, and suddenly no holes, etc). </p> <p>So I opened dialogue with him again and he had a bit of a cold response this time, he goes &quot;well I have other jobs too I need to make money&quot;... so I was like, wth... instead of acting up, I just offered him more money on the spot. I told him maybe even work out a weekly or monthly salary, tell me how much money you make a month and we can work up from there! Then you can focus on my project!</p> <p>And that wasn&#39;t enough? Now his mother died, his doctor told him he can&#39;t draw anymore (even though his social media is coming up with new art all the time...), and I don&#39;t know I just want to bash my head against the wall.</p> <p>Should I just fire him and cut loose on that stupid 1k, should I try to continue negotiate with this artist for a weekly/monthly salaray or a bigger flat rate? Or is this enough of a red flag to just run for the hills right now... I&#39;m so tired. I have a massive game with fully funtional systems, on a white canvas, with no art. It makes me weep.</p> <p>Sorry for the heft message, probably no one reading but if you did, thank you for listening.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rehmlok"> /u/Rehmlok </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mp78ly/i_am_losing_faith_in_my_new_artist_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mp78ly/i_am_losing_faith_in_my_new_artist_after/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is an aspect of development that I‚Äôve been continually wrestling with, through good and bad. It‚Äôs also funnily enough a question of perspective as much as the technical details of what I‚Äôm making. That push and pull between the game I <em>want</em> to make, code, pretty up‚Ä¶ and the one I can actually creatively channel with my skill (and resources). And knowing full well that the first option is not necessarily the better product, above and beyond any realistic considerations.</p> <p>The version in my head has branching quests, reactive environments, custom combat animations, full UI polish, and visual storytelling in every corner. The version on my drive has greyscale tiles, placeholders everywhere, lots of graphical issues and a TO DO list the length of my‚Ä¶ patience. And every day is basically a negotiation between those two realities.</p> <p>What‚Äôs made this especially tricky for me is that my instincts lean into the cinematic. I care about atmosphere. I care about moments that feel like the player has stepped into a world that has a meaning in itself, without the player‚Äôs observation. But I‚Äôm also one guy with a tight schedule, limited budget, and a strong tendency to overthink most things in life. So the real work has become deciding what parts of the vision are structural necessities, and what parts are just my creative ego dressed up as necessity.</p> <p>At a certain point, I had to start pulling in outside help and not just for practical reasons, but because I didn‚Äôt want to waste time one something that I just didn‚Äôt have the right skills for. I‚Äôve used Fiverr, had an Artstation dude who made some specific boss models. CGTalk was good while it existed too. I also go to that <a href="https://devotedfusion.com/">Devoted Fusion</a> site often enough now because I found it narrows the search for some particular assets I need crafted to fill in the placeholders. A little bit at a time I found works best - and paying only for specific and well outlined needs of the game <em>as is</em> instead of cashing out and wasting money on back and forths that just lead me back into a bigger mess.</p> <p>That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at, still stubborn about my vision, but trying to get better at picking my battles. And thinking of myself more as a funnel for creative work than the actual focus. They say between the idea and the reality, the world waits with bated breath, but that‚Äôs just dev space for ya.</p> <p>Sum of all sums, learning to go smaller is a hassle but it‚Äôs the only road I found that yields practical results when it comes to quality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rasputin5332"> /u/Rasputin5332 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mp4ycl/how_do_you_balance_your_creative_vision_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mp4ycl/how_do_you_balance_your_creative_vision_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Because most people in the industry know that these numbers could have easily brought in <strong>$500k+ gross</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Why did this happen?</strong></p> <p>It‚Äôs simple:<br/> I <strong>rushed</strong>. I was <strong>inexperienced</strong>. And I <strong>thought I was the best.</strong></p> <p>The game went from 0 to launch in just 4 months. I did an incredible job with marketing: I‚Äôll give myself credit for that. <strong>In 4 months</strong>, I gathered <strong>22,000 wishlists</strong> (mostly from Tier 1 countries).</p> <p>So what went wrong after that?</p> <p><strong>Bugs. Lots of them.</strong></p> <p>I released the demo without any plan, just opened it up as far as I had built it. No time limits, no level limits, no proper QA.</p> <p>I did learn from the demo and fixed many bugs, even had a ‚Äúnever again‚Äù list ready for my next game‚Äôs demo. I thought I‚Äôd fix everything by launch.</p> <p>The launch wasn‚Äôt terrible, but if you‚Äôve built 22k wishlists and attracted that much attention, expectations are high.</p> <p>Bugs were still there, and my biggest mistake was:<br/> <strong>Releasing an Early Access game as if it were a full launch.</strong></p> <p><strong>QA, QA, QA.</strong></p> <p>So why couldn‚Äôt I stop the bugs, even after fixing so many?</p> <p>Because instead of focusing on perfecting my core mechanics, I kept adding random features here and there, turning it into a messy mix of everything.</p> <p>No matter what you do, remember these 3 things if you‚Äôre making a game:</p> <ol> <li>Marketing and growth are important &quot;absolutely&quot; but‚Ä¶</li> <li><strong>If you‚Äôre going to release a buggy, unpolished game, don‚Äôt release it at all.</strong></li> <li><strong>Find your core mechanic and stick to it. Don‚Äôt turn it into soup.</strong></li> </ol> <p>My upcoming game, <strong>Paddle Together</strong>, is actually coming out even faster (around 3 months), but I‚Äôm <strong>testing it like crazy, not taking a single step until I‚Äôm confident.</strong> I‚Äôll also <strong>release the demo as a fixed, specific level</strong> near the end of development <strong>so I can put out a complete game.</strong></p> <p><strong>Don‚Äôt get swept away by hype. People will expect a smooth, polished, and enjoyable experience.</strong></p> <p><strong>Remember: as long as your product is good, even a niche market will support you, as long as you deliver on expectations.</strong></p> <p>Just a little edit:<br/> -- I wrote the post myself, fixed some typos with AI and fully bolded the parts myself. Some of you guys said it made it harder to read, sorry for that!</p> <p>-- I am not bragging about the money (it&#39;s before taxes, cuts etc. btw) I just wanted to say that your game can collect lots of interest and can have loots of potential, please do not make the same mistakes that I did.</p> <p>-- This was my full time (actually day and night) job, and I am not a student or something (already graduated), that was a big opportunity cost for me.</p> <p>-- My new game has much more smaller scope and I am again working day and night on it but now with lots of attention, that&#39;s why It is gonna (probably) take 3 months, I hope you guys will try demo and will understand what I mean.</p> <p>I really hope this post will help the ones who will need it!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently working on a project in Rust, but I&#39;m already familiar with languages like PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and C#.<br/> In my project, I&#39;m using <strong>Axum</strong> + <strong>diesel-async</strong> (PostgreSQL) and I&#39;ve reached the stage where I need to set up the database connection and everything related to it. I want to apply the <strong>Repository pattern</strong>, but I&#39;ve run into a problem: I don&#39;t understand where I should store the <code>db_pool</code>.</p> <p>Should it go into the global <code>AppState</code> (like in most examples - although to me this feels wrong because everything gets mixed together there, like <code>db_pool</code>, <code>config</code>, etc.) or into something like <code>infrastructure/db.rs</code>?</p> <p>Also, how should I pass <code>&amp;mut AsyncPgConnection</code> to the repository? ChatGPT suggests getting it in the service layer via <code>pool.get</code> and then passing it to the repository method - but that doesn&#39;t feel right to me, because it mixes layers. If we follow DDD, the repository should hide all the details of data access.</p> <p>I‚Äôve already spent quite a lot of time researching this, but unfortunately haven&#39;t found a clear answer yet.

For a large part using a note-taking assistant like zk along with a good editor like helix gets my job done. Discovering typst was a dream come true and I have trying to make a zettelkasten like setup using it. This is where zty comes in, it started as bash script as a &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; using a typst package called basalt-lib. I got a lot to learn and it inspired me to write a full blown CLI tool. That being said, I&#39;m new to programming in rust and choose it cause I wanted to learn the language and some ideas for future projects. I have been able to make significant progress with the project so far and it is actively under development, and pretty sure they are better implementations compared to current ones for what I want to achieve. I&#39;m here to ask for help from someone more experienced who can test the code and suggest fixes. Especially with the typst integration for linking and tagging notes and on how to implement a lsp-server to integrate with editors. Thank you for reading. I&#39;ve added the project repo link. Do check out and star it to follow progress. I&#39;m hoping I end up solving the problem of other like me with this project.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all,</p> <p>I‚Äôve been working on a big rust project called c<em>ortex with</em> over 75k lines at this point, and one of the things I built for it was a system for graceful upgrades. Recently I pulled that piece of code out, cleaned it up, and decided to share it as its own crate in case it&#39;s useful to anyone else.</p> <p>The idea is pretty straightforward: it&#39;s a fork+exec mechanism with a Linux pipe for passing data between the original process and the &quot;upgraded&quot; process. It&#39;s designed to work well with systemd for zero downtime upgrades. In production I use it alongside systemd&#39;s socket activation, but it should be tweakable to work with alternatives.</p> <p>The crate is called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bye"><code>bye</code></a>. It mostly follows systemd conventions so you can drop it into a typical service setup without too much fuss.</p> <p>If you&#39;re doing long-lived services in Rust and want painless, no-downtime upgrades, I&#39;d love for you to give it a try (or tear it apart, your choice üòÖ).</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/dgagn/bye">github link</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dgagn"> /u/dgagn </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mp3tc0/rust_fun_graceful_upgrades_called_bye/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mp3tc0/rust_fun_graceful_upgrades_called_bye/">[comments]</a></span></div>

While ply files are a format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format">from the 90s</a>), they are still very much around for computer graphics and have somehow become the standard for &quot;gaussian splatting&quot; (<a href="https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush">shameless plug</a>). The rust ecosystem has a crate for ply files <a href="https://github.com/Fluci/ply-rs">https://github.com/Fluci/ply-rs</a>, but in my testing it&#39;s about ~4-7x slower than <code>serde-ply</code>.</p> <p><code>serde-ply</code> aims to get all the modern serde conveniences without sacrificing too much performance (hitting about ~1 GB/s, in line with <a href="https://github.com/ton/PLYbench">other libraries</a>).</p> <p>As ply files are basically big &quot;tables&quot;, it&#39;s also possible to stream the results row by row. I&#39;ve added some methods to read ply files in &quot;chunks&quot;. These chunks of data also can also come from an <code>async</code> reader, so while the library has 0 async code it is compatible with <code>async</code> reading.</p> <p>I hope it&#39;s useful to more people, if nothing else I&#39;ve enjoyed learning a lot about serde&#39;s innards!

It is written in rust and provides knowledge management utilities through the LSP, adhering to and compatible with <a href="http://Obsidian.md">Obsidian.md</a> . Many people who like neovim/zed/helix, don&#39;t like Obsidian&#39;s editor, and do like Obsidian&#39;s philosophy use it.</p> <p>I created markdown-oxide 3 years ago and have been maintaining it since then. For the past year, I&#39;ve also been working at <a href="http://Exa.ai">Exa.ai</a>, organizing the web (building independent web search) in Rust.</p> <p>Before starting at Exa, I was in high school and had several hours per week to work on markdown-oxide. Now, I work 14 hours per day, 5.5 days per week on web search (I love my work) and only have time to resolve issues semi-consistently. <strong>I envision an amazing future for markdown oxide, but I don&#39;t have time to create it</strong>.</p> <p>Now that <strong>1</strong> AI makes using knowledge graphs (like obsidian) not tedious, <strong>2</strong> it can use tools very well (like the oxide MCP that I have in a PR), and <strong>3</strong> it can automate many annoying parts of personal knowledge management (copying, formatting, tagging, ...), <strong>I think that Markdown-Oxide can become 10x more useful to &gt;10x more people</strong>. Also I&#39;m really sad that oxide issues are not getting the attention they deserve. I believe that there exists a person who can make markdown-oxide an amazing product and scale it an impressive amount. I also envision this person as a high-school aged Rust/philosophy nerd like I was when I made this project - though this is not required of course. Also, I can afford to pay someone $500/month for this (which I&#39;d hope is decent for this individual).</p> <p><strong><em>I&#39;m writing this post at 2:45am in SF to try to find an inspired Rust/Philosophy enthusiast to re-modernize Markdown-Oxide and keep it&#39;s users happy</em></strong> <em>+</em> get paid a little ($500/month)</p> <p>reach out at [<a href="mailto:felixazeller@gmail.com">felixazeller@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href="mailto:felixazeller@gmail.com">felixazeller@gmail.com</a>)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/feel-ix-343"> /u/feel-ix-343 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mp0398/feelix343markdownoxide_16k_stars_100k_downloads/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mp0398/feelix343markdownoxide_16k_stars_100k_downloads/">[comments]</a></span></div>
