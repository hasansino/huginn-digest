            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm building a 2D MMORPG in GDevelop with a small team, and recently reworked the early combat system based on feedback that it felt flat and repetitive. I added hit feedback, screen shake, and some enemy variety to make things more engaging. It‚Äôs better now, but I‚Äôm still struggling to make the early encounters feel meaningful without overwhelming the player.</p> <p>For those of you who‚Äôve worked on action RPGs or MMOs‚Äîhow do you structure early game combat to avoid grind without overloading the player with complexity?</p> <p>I‚Äôm especially curious about:</p> <ul> <li>How you pace combat abilities</li> <li>Introducing enemies that feel distinct without bloating the system</li> <li>Ways to test and validate that your combat feels responsive</li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôm happy to share what I‚Äôve learned from using GDevelop if that‚Äôs helpful too. I‚Äôm not trying to promote a release‚Äîjust trying to improve the foundation while it‚Äôs still in progress.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Anybody7882"> /u/No-Anybody7882 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ki68b5/how_do_you_balance_early_combat_to_avoid/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ki68b5/how_do_you_balance_early_combat_to_avoid/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>1. Game Info / Steampage</h1> <p><em>(skip to next point if not interested)</em></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Fantasy World Manager</p> <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Florian Alushaj Games</p> <p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Florian Alushaj Games</p> <p><strong>Steampage:</strong> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm_source=postmortem1"><strong>https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm_source=postmortem1</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Discord:</strong> <a href="https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8">https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8</a></p> <p><strong>Current Wishlists:</strong> 4,781</p> <h1>2. Pre-Launch Actions</h1> <p>i frequently got asked what i did on my Page Launch Day to bundle alot of traffic Day 1, here is what i did:</p> <p><strong>a) Discord Communities</strong></p> <p>i got Discord Premium, this allows me to join ALOT more Discord Servers in general. I have joined over 30 Gamedev related Discords that allow advertising. I have posted atleast weekly on each one of them since i started the project, which was in December 2024.</p> <p>You should not underestimate the power of those Discord Communities. While it ultimately might not convert many wishlists or mostly &quot;poor&quot; ones which might never convert, you get to meet other devs that like what you do, that already have experience or that have similar games like you to partner up or help each other.</p> <p>i have met alot of people that work for small indie studios that have released several games on steam, they gave me alot of tips for my first game, the most frequent ones:</p> <ul> <li>Do proper Market Research <ul> <li>its really important to check similar games and how games in your genre perform (median)</li> <li>find out what games you could combine, what you could do better - you dont have to reinvent the wheel.</li> <li>dont try make the 9988th vampire survivors, dont make the 9988th stardew valley, those are exceptions and not the norm. instead learn from them, what is the hook?</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Connect with other Devs</strong> <ul> <li>as already stated, other devs can be really valueable contacts and i definitely can call some of my dev contacts friends at this point, your friends are very biased no matter what you show them but your dev friends will be very honest if you ask for feedback</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>KEEP ASKING FOR FEEDBACK</strong> <ul> <li>dont stop asking for feedback where-ever you can! you may have fun with your project, playing it yourself, but you are biased! showcase new stuff, no matter if its just your first Draft - people on reddit and discord are really good at giving feedback for improvements.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Do not quit your job</strong> <ul> <li>Dont..dont...dont!</li> <li>expect your first game to be a &quot;failure&quot; in terms of revenue</li> <li>use your first game as your deep dive in all aspects of gamedev (including promotion &amp; (paid) marketing</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>LOCALIZATION</strong> <ul> <li>this is so important, please localize your steampage!!! you will see why later.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>b) Reddit</strong></p> <p><strong>I have made around 30 posts between December and 6th April (Steam Page Launch)</strong></p> <p><strong>they gained 1.3 Million Views and 14.000 Upvotes, over 1.000 shares. My Creator Page got 70+ Followers, my Reddit Account got 60+ Followers.</strong></p> <p>50% of those posts were not selfpromotion, they were progress updates in the <a href="/r/godot">r/godot</a> community (check my profile) but alot of people saw my game and kept it in mind, because i posted frequently, and people kept pushing my posts!</p> <p><strong>c) thats it...</strong></p> <p>you may have expected way more, but thats everything i did pre-steam-page-launch. However, my Reddit posts were a sign that my game does really well on Reddit. - thats important for post-launch activities i did.</p> <h1>3. Launch Day</h1> <p><strong>Those are the things i did on Launch Day:</strong></p> <p>a) i posted on ALL Discord Communites i am part of that i launched my Steampage and asked for support! If i sum the reactions i got up in all those communitys, i got over 200 Reactions, i didnt UTM track those unfortunately but it definitely had an Traffic Impact.</p> <p>b) i made reddit posts in some subreddits, those posts gained around 120k views combined, 300 shares.also here i didnt know that utm tracklinks existed but from the steam stats i could tell alot of traffic was from reddit.</p> <p><strong>Tose are the the things that happened without me doing anything on Launch Day:</strong></p> <p>a) 4gamer article + twitter post:</p> <p>the japanese magacine 4gamer posted my game, they just picked it up organically - if it was not localized in japanese, they would never have found my steam page. Thanks to their article i gained 700 wishlists from japan in the first 24 hours.</p> <p>this combined with my own effort made me around 1,100 wishlists in the first day.</p> <h1>4.) What happened since then?</h1> <p>I made another Reddit post in gamedev,indiedev,worldbuilding some days after, which made me another 700 wishlists. Then i started getting quiet, i didnt post anymore for almost a Month. My Organic wishlists were 100 for a few day, it went down to 30-40. Without me doing anything i was gaining those daily wishlists.. which was and still is really crazy.</p> <h1>5.) Paid Reddit Ads</h1> <p>After i reached 2.100 wishlists (17th april) i was certain that my game is really being liked on reddit, it was time to take the advice from fellow devs i met and try out reddit ads and hell yeah, it was the best decision. Since 17th April i have been running ads, i have made atleast 1600 wishlists with a spent budget of 400‚Ç¨ , those are the UTM tracked wishlists, which is an investment of 0,26‚Ç¨ per wishlist.</p> <p>My Ads are still running, and i will keep them running until the demo releases. If you advertise in the right Subreddits, you will find your audience! Those are not &quot;poor&quot; wishlists as many people rant about. Many Contacts told me publishers usually do a big bugdet reddit ad campaign until your game has 7k wishlists and then they stop.</p> <p>So why not do the same strategy?</p> <p><strong>My tips:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Go for Conversion in your AD Campaign</strong></p> <p><strong>2. it does not matter if you use Carousel,Video,Image, i prefer Carousel</strong></p> <p><strong>3. Only include countries you localize for</strong></p> <p><strong>4. US should be in its own campaign, set your CPC to 0.30 , it will perform well enough</strong></p> <p><strong>5. Leave your Comments on, reply to people. i ahve really good experience with that (60+ comments on my ads)</strong></p> <p><strong>6. Also bring in people to your discord, i crossed 100 people today, its really cool to have people that love your game,it boosts motivation so high and you got playtesters!</strong></p> <h1>6. NUMBER SICKNESS! CAREFUL!</h1> <p>This is really crazy, but if your game performs well with numbers.. stop looking at your numbers.. dont do it! I did that and i did only that for atleast a week, doing nothing for the game - just starring at those raising numbers and when one day it dropped a bit, i felt some panic! I felt like the game is gonna fail while still performing better tan 90% of indie projects (firsts).</p> <p>i am only checking numbers weekly since that happened to me.</p> <p>well..thats it.. i hope it was interesting. feel free to ask more questions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot-Persimmon-9768"> /u/Hot-Persimmon-9768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ki3odn/i_made_5k_wishlists_in_my_first_month_on_steam/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ki3odn/i_made_5k_wishlists_in_my_first_month_on_steam/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Others, even with cool ideas, still come off kinda clunky. So it got me thinking:</p> <p>What gives you that immediate ‚Äúwow, this is polished‚Äù vibe in a web game today? Is it buttery-smooth performance, clever UX details, tight audio, or something else entirely?</p> <p>I‚Äôm asking because I really believe web games are only going to keep growing ‚Äî no downloads, instant access, cross-platform by default‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs so much potential.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I‚Äôm writing this as a 20-year-old who just wanted to open up a bit.</p> <p>When I was a kid, I always wanted to become a pilot. Unfortunately, due to a vision problem, I couldn&#39;t pursue that dream. Because of that disappointment, I started distancing myself from anything tech-related. But during the COVID-19 lockdowns, spending so much time at home led me to explore the world of software development for the first time. At first, it was just a hobby. I didn‚Äôt play games much, but whenever I sat at a computer, I really enjoyed playing GTA (like 90% of gamers out there, I guess).</p> <p>Later on, since I enjoy spending time with people, I wanted to become a dentist. But unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt get the required score in my country‚Äôs university entrance exams two years in a row. So, with the score I did get, I decided to pursue software engineering ‚Äî the field I had only considered as a hobby until then.</p> <p>Once I started university and spent more time in front of the screen, I started getting bored and tired. I noticed my room getting messier too. Spending long hours coding was draining me. I always wanted to do something more physical. I kept wondering if maybe I should‚Äôve left software as just a hobby. But changing my major would mean preparing for the university exam again and losing another year, which I couldn‚Äôt afford, so I stayed in my program.</p> <p>Eventually, I thought that making games could be more rewarding because I‚Äôd see more tangible results. Even though it‚Äôs still not a physical job, there‚Äôs a chance that someone might play a game I made ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôd even see someone on the street with my game on their phone or computer. So, I chose to focus on game development. But it‚Äôs not an easy field either ‚Äî it brings together many disciplines and still requires long hours in front of a computer. Sure, I could try to manage my time better, but life keeps moving: bills to pay, rent, groceries... the list goes on.</p> <p>So now, I want to ask the game developer community:</p> <p>Are you able to support yourself financially with your current job? Do you actually enjoy what you do? Does spending so much time in front of a screen wear you out? Do you ever find yourself thinking about doing something more physical while working as a game developer, like I do?</p> <p>In my country (Turkey), there‚Äôs a saying: ‚Äúabi-karde≈ü gibi sohbet,‚Äù which means chatting like brothers. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a similar phrase globally, but I wanted to write this as sincerely as possible.</p> <p>Thank you for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Surprise_1837"> /u/Ok_Surprise_1837 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khuwjj/trying_to_turn_a_hobby_into_a_career_but_now_im/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khuwjj/trying_to_turn_a_hobby_into_a_career_but_now_im/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m Arek. Solo developer of Winter Falling: Battle Tactics. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285060/Winter_Falling_Battle_Tactics/">[LINK]</a><br/> Exactly 6 years ago, I started working on a massive project and I didn‚Äôt know it.<br/> I&#39;ll tell you how I prepared for Early Access, how it went, how I earned some money and how I failed.</p> <h1>TL;DR Stats</h1> <p><strong>Development Start:</strong> 8 May 2019<br/> <strong>EA Release:</strong> 8 November 2022<br/> <strong>Lifetime units:</strong> Over 13k<br/> <strong>Lifetime revenue:</strong> Over $100k<br/> <strong>Average time played:</strong> Around 3 hours<br/> <strong>Wishlists</strong> at EA release: 5190<br/> <strong>Units returned:</strong> 12%<br/> <strong>Development time:</strong> 6 years, started with 2 web prototypes.<br/> <strong>Was it a success:</strong> Depends.<br/> Compared to industry standards - failure.<br/> For me - definitely a success. Way bigger than I deserve. But a competent developer without mental issues could get 10 times better figures than me.</p> <p><strong>(Expanded Postmortem with Graphs, Pictures &amp; Backstory -</strong><a href="https://rarykos.substack.com/p/winter-falling-steam-ea-postmortem"> <strong>[LINK]</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h1>The Game</h1> <p>A medieval battle simulator wrapped in a fantasy tortilla served with a side dish of RPG campaign. Completely unrealistic, but focused on fun and theme. Imagine you‚Äôre managing a mercenary company in your favourite fantasy world from your younger days.</p> <p>Take battle mechanics from Total War, FTL and mash them up with vibes from 90s fantasy like Willow, Discworld and Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat.</p> <h1>Development</h1> <p><strong>2019 Prototype 1.</strong> You might remember the HBO show Game of Thrones. I made a joke game about the battle of Winterfell. Took me 3 months. Got a bit of traction back in the day. <a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling">[LINK]</a> So I decided to work on a full game using this art style!</p> <p><strong>Bandwagons are powerful</strong>. Take a look at Vampire Survivors or Balatro clones. Find a bandwagon you‚Äôre personally excited about and you‚Äôre 90% guaranteed some kind of success. Unless your art sucks. Mine is passable. A bandwagon gave me this adventure! It sounds like an excuse to sell out or make slop, but that&#39;s not what I mean. I&#39;d advise other game developers to follow their own interests &amp; hobbies.</p> <p><strong>2020 Prototype 2.</strong> More battles. More management. A real game! 9 months of work. This time with a link to the newly created Steam page. The goal was to use the web game to gather wishlists. This worked wonders over many years of the development! I think the Memoir&#39;44 influence is heavy here. <a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling-price-of-life">[LINK]</a><a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling-price-of-life"></a></p> <p>Chris actually wrote a blog post about this very strategy, but on a recent, wildly successful game.<a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/04/28/how-an-itch-io-game-became-a-million-dollar-hit-the-roottrees-are-dead/"> [LINK]</a> For comparison, my prototypes gathered 200k views over their lifetimes, but earned $54 in donations COMBINED on itchio. Click-through to Steam 0.1%. These are not great numbers.</p> <p><strong>True Game.</strong> Oof. 2 years of work starting from scratch. New codebase, new art, new mechanics. Web games had to use Left-Mouse-Button ONLY. This time I can use more controls! The design space is so large and there are so many options/expectations that I frequently run around in circles. Every 3 months I had to push the deadline ahead. Players coming up with new suggestions, I didn&#39;t know what to do with them most of the time. Fear of disappointing them was killing the development.</p> <p><strong>2022 Steam Next Fest.</strong> Managed to prepare a demo for the festival. Best choice, hands down. Wishlists exploded and youtubers took notice of the game. For comparison, two years of the Steam page presence gave me ~3000 wishlists. This festival provided ~2000 in a week.</p> <p><strong>2022 Early Access Launch.</strong> Big day. I was fixing bugs and writing the campaign up to the last minute. Sadly, the campaign only had 2-3 hours. Had no time to write marketing emails before, I was so busy with the code. Now all I could do was poke a few youtubers and hope my meagre marketing assets could be useful for their videos. Frankly, Steam emails carried the launch day. The moment I hit &quot;Publish&quot; on Steam, I went outside for a quiet walk to finally take my mind off things.</p> <p>Woke up in the morning to positive reviews. <strong>255 sales.</strong> Good enough!<br/> Immediately, started working on a hotfix for newly found bugs. </p> <p><strong>Post Early Access...</strong> This is the real story. When it comes to revenue: festivals and youtube videos provide 90%. I make gameplay &amp; content updates, but it&#39;s more for the fun of the players, doesn&#39;t really change the sales graph.</p> <p>For a time I did Weekly Updates, but it was too much, it&#39;s only a fun thing when you&#39;ve got a team. </p> <p>I wonder if 1.0 launch will be better than my EA launch? Considering that the bulk of my sales came not from the launch, but from various events.</p> <p>Wish I could write more about this time, but I did very little work on Winter Falling over the last 2.5 years. Medical problems are not fun. Genetic lottery is very real. (more on that later)</p> <h1>What Went Right</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Youtube videos.</strong> Winter Falling would probably lay dead in the water if it wasn‚Äôt for content creators who stumbled upon the game. Either on Steam Next Fest or on itch.io. Me, personally, I sent about 10 emails on launch day and that‚Äôs all the marketing I did. Don‚Äôt know if anybody read them. I know that Splattercat responded. Over the next months many content creators made videos, but I‚Äôll always remember the first videos made by esty8nine, Retromation, Nookrium and Splattercat. I‚Äôm extremely grateful!</li> <li><strong>Putting the Steam page up early.</strong> Gathers wishlists from youtube videos. Steam also suggests the game to Steam users, that‚Äôs an incredible algorithm, way better than Google or Apple.</li> <li><strong>Web prototypes done quick.</strong> 3 months for a polished game is okay. Could be even faster. This rapid prototyping allowed me to test MANY ideas and keep my excitement up. The important lesson is to know when to abandon the prototype and how to start fresh. Why do I complain about my code then? Usually because I made the system one way, spent a long time there making it stable and expandable, then it turns out I need a completely different system. That‚Äôs exactly what prototypes are for!</li> <li><strong>Web prototypes knew their audience.</strong> First was Game of Thrones fandom, then historical battle channels, then Battle Brothers fandom. Right now Winter Falling is known as a mix of Total War and Battle Brothers. The game would be dead if I hadn‚Äôt pivoted. Nobody in their right mind would be playing a Game of Thrones fanfic in 2025.</li> <li><strong>Weekly updates.</strong> For a while after release I could sustain regular updates in Early Access. Sounds nice, but I am alone. How much can I do in a week? I managed to release some content and some features that the community wanted. Players were surprised that they offer feedback on Monday and on Friday there‚Äôs a new build implementing their ideas. <strong>Responsiveness is rare, it seems.</strong></li> <li><strong>Polishing art</strong>. The game art went through A LOT of iterations. Looking back on it it‚Äôs clear where I made the right choice and what was a mistake. I‚Äôm glad I kept improving art. I‚Äôm not a good artist, I just try a lot. Actually, the same thing applies to my code and sound.</li> <li><strong>Determination</strong> Funny element that. I wake up, I work on the game. I don‚Äôt think about the alternatives, because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing last year and that‚Äôs what I want to do. But sometimes people are surprised when I say I‚Äôve been working on the same game for 6 years. It would be nice to start a new game, but this one‚Äôs not finished yet, I must bring it to the finish line. Cycles are really strange when you start noticing them. There‚Äôs a new update, new players, new modders excited to play with the system. Couple months fly by, they‚Äôre gone. Sometimes there are months when nothing happens and I‚Äôm completely alone. But then there‚Äôs a new wave of new names. I don‚Äôt know how this happens, but I‚Äôve seen many developers abandon projects where all they needed was more determination. Usually they hit a brick wall where they need to learn new skills and improve, but instead they run. I‚Äôm guilty here as well. <strong>Took me 10 years of my career to understand that you need impressive skills to make an impressive game.</strong></li> </ol> <h1>What Went Wrong</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Keymailer and marketing scams.</strong> I paid for a couple of these promotional services, complete waste of money. Nothing happened. The keys I provided for free were 99% stolen. Won‚Äôt be using these in the future.</li> <li><strong>Licensed music problems.</strong> I bought a license for game music from stock composers. In theory, this means it‚Äôs completely okay to use in youtube videos etc. In practice, youtube videos will get a copyright strike automatically and then when you contest it you can show your license and maybe things work out. Huge problem. I‚Äôm really sorry this happened to youtubers who tried to help me like Splattercat. New music is currently being composed, for the time being I implemented an optional Streamer Mode which disabled licensed music‚Ä¶</li> <li><strong>Single playthrough.</strong> I prepared a single campaign that takes 3-4 hours to complete. That‚Äôs nice for a demo, but not for the full game. Why would you replay the same story? Nobody cares when I add new content like units, or new systems like experience. I need to prepare a new campaign just to showcase new content. Games need replayability if they‚Äôre in Early Access.</li> <li><strong>I‚Äôm scared of posting online.</strong> Like every developer I‚Äôm terrified by the prospect of marketing. But it gets worse. Is my work worth posting? Every time I start working on new marketing materials I‚Äôm scared there‚Äôs nothing impressive here, why would anyone care? This is actually a bigger psychological issues I‚Äôm working through.</li> <li><strong>Didn‚Äôt learn the skills I wanted, because of rushing.</strong> Wanted to improve my 2D art. Landscapes, characters. Instead I got sucked in jumping from task to task. I‚Äôm late. I‚Äôm behind schedule. Promised X last month! Can‚Äôt take weekends off. I need to rush! Writing suffered most. On one hand there are things I wanted to write, but they made no sense in this form. This is not a visual novel. Don‚Äôt bore players who only want tactics! I created little story content, because I was constantly bouncing around. Always thinking ‚ÄúI need to finish this ASAP and start that, no time to learn.‚Äù</li> <li><strong>Long development.</strong>.. <ol> <li><strong>Indecisiveness, fear of making the wrong step.</strong> People often said &quot;this game is right up my alley&quot;. Great. But I don‚Äôt know that alley. Often times, I don‚Äôt even know what city I‚Äôm in. The design was changing very often and every controversial piece of feedback destroyed my process. Instead of committing to a solution I was always trying to accommodate all feedback. Always trying to make EVERYONE happy. Which is impossible and it really ruins your psyche.</li> <li><strong>Nostalgia clinging</strong> Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat has a nice long linear campaign. Awesome for year 1999. Less so for 2025. There were parts of my vision which made no sense, but I really wanted to incorporate them. After 2 years in Early Access I realized how stupid I was and I started working on things people actually wanted from a game like this.</li> </ol></li> <li><strong>Health problems. Maybe stress caused back problems?</strong> This is great. Imagine working 3 hours a day and spending the rest in agonizing pain. I got used to it, somehow. You work from 9 to 12 and then you must lay down. Maybe a walk will help a little and you‚Äôll get additional 2 hours of sitting time. At some point my my back starts hurting. I remove the pain from one spot with expensive physical therapy and medication. Then it comes back in another spot along my spine. Eventually it settles in my mid-back below shoulder plates. One strand of muscles near the spine is aching. What is it? <em>Nobody knows.</em> It shouldn‚Äôt hurt. Maybe my collapsed chest does something to the muscles? Many scans and doctor visits later I‚Äôm still lost. There is another story here about doctors not caring, but I won‚Äôt bore you. Great experience paying for both private and public health insurance just to be treated like an annoying fly. As I‚Äôm writing this in May 2025 I managed to alleviate some pain. Still working on it.</li> </ol> <h1>Money Talk</h1> <p>$100k Steam revenue means I received around $60k to my bank account, after Steam fees, returns and US taxes. After all taxes it&#39;s around $35k disposable income over 3 years. $1k for each month to pay bills and eat. <em>(If my math is correct).</em><br/> Why so little?<br/> In Poland we pay tax for the privilege of operating a business. $500 monthly, doesn&#39;t matter if you have any income or not. This is horrible if you&#39;re making a game without generating any income, like 50% of my time. You have one month with $3k income and the rest of the year is empty, working on the game and waiting for another big sale.</p> <p>I can continue the development because my lifestyle is very much ascetic. But I need freelance jobs. <strong>If you need a Unity programmer, 2D artist, or even a writer, please think of me!</strong></p> <p>Well, Winter Falling enters its 6th year of development and I am unsure how many years before it&#39;s done. Probably one or two. But I know the road ahead and I am sure it&#39;s the best way forward, because I&#39;ve discussed it with my community and more importantly... I&#39;ve re-discovered the fun of the game for myself. I had spent a long time in the trenches. Working. Worrying about numbers and trying to please everyone. But recently I&#39;ve realized what the kid inside of me wants from Winter Falling. I prepared a roadmap. Players like it. We&#39;re on the same page now, so it seems like I won my fight against indecisiveness and fear.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, Arek</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rarykos"> /u/rarykos </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khuhz2/tactics_game_postmortem_6_years_to_100k/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khuhz2/tactics_game_postmortem_6_years_to_100k/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>About a year and a half ago I read something on his sub about the &quot;little every day&quot; method of keeping up steam on a project, as opposed to the huge chunks of work that people like to do when they&#39;re inspired mixed with the weeks/months of nothing in between. Both to remind me and help me keep track, I added a recurring task to my calendar that I would mark as complete if I spent more than 5 min working on any of my projects. Using this method, I&#39;ve managed to put out 3 games working barely part time in that year and a half. I&#39;ll bullet point some things to make this post more digestible.</p> <ul> <li><p>It&#39;s helped me build a habit. Working on my projects now doesn&#39;t seem like something I do when I&#39;m inspired, but something I expect to do every day. That&#39;s kept more of my games from fading out of my mind.</p></li> <li><p>Without ever stopping, I have developed a continuous set of tools that is constantly improving. Before this, every time I would start a new idea I would start with a fresh set of tools, scripts, art assets, audio. Working continuously has helped me keep track of what tools I already have, what assets I can adapt, what problems I had to solve with the late development of the last game, and sometimes I still have those solutions hanging around.</p></li> <li><p>Keeping the steady pace and getting though multiple projects has kept me realistic, and has not only helped me scope current project, but plot reasonable ideas in the future for games I can make with tools I mostly already have, instead of getting really worked up about a project I couldn&#39;t reasonably complete.</p></li> <li><p>Development is addictive, and even on the days when I wasn&#39;t feeling it, I would often sit down to do my obligatory 5 min and end up doing an hour or two of good work.</p></li> </ul> <p>When I went back to my calendar, it looks like I hit about 70% of my days. A perfect 100% would have been nice, but adding to my game 70% of all days is still a lot better than it would have been without this. My skills are also developing faster than they would have without, and not suffering the atrophy they would if I was abandoning projects and leaving weeks or months in between development. All in all, a good habit. If you struggle with motivation, you should give it a shot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/intimidation_crab"> /u/intimidation_crab </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khtc58/did_the_little_every_day_method_for_about_a_year/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1khtc58/did_the_little_every_day_method_for_about_a_year/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When inserting new entities that have 1-to-1 relationships (or other types of relations), the usual approach is to first insert related entities individually, get their generated IDs, and then insert the main entity referencing those IDs.</p> <p>There seem to be two main approaches you can take:</p> <ul> <li>Separate Simple CRUD Queries in a managed transaction from Go</li> </ul> <p>Write individual SQL statements for each table, call them sequentially from Go, and use the returned IDs:</p> <pre><code>tx := db.Begin() authorID := db.InsertAuthor(...) // if err tx.rollback()... bookID := db.InsertBook(..., authorID) // if err tx.rollback()... tx.Commit() </code></pre> <p>This approach needs Go code to manage a db transaction for commit/rollback logic in the case of errors.</p> <ul> <li>Single SQL Query with CTEs (Common Table Expression)</li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, combine all inserts into one query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs):</p> <pre><code>WITH new_author AS ( INSERT INTO authors (...) VALUES (...) RETURNING id ), new_book AS ( INSERT INTO books (..., author_id) SELECT ..., new_author.id FROM new_author RETURNING id ) SELECT * FROM new_book; </code></pre> <p>This avoids round-trips to db and doesn&#39;t need a transaction to be created and managed. Besides that, if you use SQLC, you end up with the final, ready to use function getting generated like &quot;CreateBook&quot; that generates your aggregate type without writing any additional code.</p> <p>From my experience, SQLC can handle queries involving CTEs just fine. Writing raw SQL like this is powerful but it becomes repetitive and you eventually can&#39;t keep things DRY.</p> <p>Curious how others are approaching this.</p> <p>Are you leaning toward Go code with multiple queries, or pushing more logic into SQL? If so, how do you handle the repetitive nature of CTEs?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone!<br/> I&#39;ve just created a small piece of software that I hope will be useful to you too. As the name suggests, Go Go Proxy is an API proxy that includes JWT-based authentication, response caching via Redis, and rate limiting.</p> <p>How does it work? Go Go Proxy receives an incoming request and forwards it (copying both the body and headers) to the URL specified as a query parameter, while adding the required API key. This makes it easy to add an extra security layer to public API calls ‚Äî especially thanks to rate limiting and caching, which can help reduce costs when using paid services.</p> <p>It also supports optional checks on Origin, Referer, and includes a heuristic control to verify that requests are likely being made by a browser via JavaScript.</p> <p>You can find all the documentation here: <a href="https://github.com/luca-martinelli-09/go-go-proxy">https://github.com/luca-martinelli-09/go-go-proxy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/martinelli_luca"> /u/martinelli_luca </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1khvez6/go_go_proxy_a_secure_flexible_api_proxy_with/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1khvez6/go_go_proxy_a_secure_flexible_api_proxy_with/">[comments]</a></span></div>

The issue is I want to create the thumbnail and simalteneously update the video status in a transaction.

It fixes so many issues with having to use Make, Cmake, Ninja etc, but sometimes it feels like Rust has been influenced too much by the web dev world of massive dependency graphs.

I&#39;ve seen a lot of examples that more or less boil down to &quot;if you set up lifetimes like this, it lets you do this thing&quot;, with little-to-no explanation of why you shouldn&#39;t just do that every time, or why that&#39;s not the default behaviour, so that doesn&#39;t really answer the question here.</p> <p>I get what lifetimes do, but from a &quot;software design perspective&quot;, is there any circumstance where I actually care much about it?
