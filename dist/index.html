            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h5>What is Lemon BugSnag?</h5> <p>Lemon BugSnag is a Rust crate for interacting with the BugSnag error-reporting and session-tracking APIs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>Why is Lemon BugSnag?</h5> <p>Lemon BugSnag grew out of a Rust learning project that our team undertook starting in mid-2022. After losing most of the participants to attrition, the Rusty Rebels consisted of only myself and one coworker. In early 2023, we decided to build this library as part of an effort to port some of our existing company projects to Rust.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>Why Lemon?</h5> <p>After some internal shifts with how our employer wants to handle open-source projects, it was decided to strip our company branding from this project and release it on one of our personal Github accounts. The lemon is both an inside joke on our team at work, and also delicious. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h5>Why should you use Lemon BugSnag?</h5> <p>We believe it is feature-rich and easy to use. We exposed all parts of the error-reporting and session-tracking APIs. We built this library with low friction as one of our primary goals, and we believe we achieved that. Although Lemon BugSnag allows for total control of all aspects of the payload, it only <em>requires</em> a minimal amount of code to begin sending payloads to the BugSnag API. Most users will need only our simple <code>configure()</code> helpers, but power users will be able to create complete and complex payloads if they so desire. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>My coworker and I started this project with zero Rust knowledge, and still consider ourselves to be novices. We did our best in most cases to research and stick to Rust best-practices. We expect there to be a lot of things in the library that need improvement, and we welcome suggestion from the community to both help us improve the library, and expand our Rust knowledge. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Check out the repository for more information.</p> <p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/lemon_bugsnag_rs">https://crates.io/crates/lemon_bugsnag_rs</a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.rs/lemon_bugsnag_rs/latest/lemon_bugsnag_rs/">https://docs.rs/lemon_bugsnag_rs/latest/lemon_bugsnag_rs/</a></p> <p><a href="https://github.com/SpaceAceMonkey/lemon-bugsnag-rs">https://github.com/SpaceAceMonkey/lemon-bugsnag-rs</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Rusty_Rebels"> /u/Rusty_Rebels </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1odk3tm/announcing_lemon_bugsnag_a_rust_library_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1odk3tm/announcing_lemon_bugsnag_a_rust_library_for/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I wanted to change that.</p> <p>With PPV Stream Rust, anyone can host their own video marketplace ‚Äî like having your own version of OnlyFans or Netflix, but open-source, transparent, and privacy-first. Each video is streamed securely (not downloadable), protected by a moving forensic watermark, and monetized directly between creator and viewer.</p> <p>üåç What makes it different ‚Ä¢ Built in Rust (Axum + SQLx) ‚Äî fast, memory-safe, production-ready. ‚Ä¢ Uses HLS streaming with dynamic watermark for anti-piracy protection. ‚Ä¢ Fully open-source &amp; self-hosted ‚Äî no central servers, no subscriptions. ‚Ä¢ C2C model: users can pay other users directly (no middleman). ‚Ä¢ Includes auth, dashboard, video upload, and Pay-Per-View access system. ‚Ä¢ Can be deployed easily on Fly.io, DigitalOcean, or any VPS.</p> <p>üß∞ Tech Stack ‚Ä¢ Backend: Rust + Axum + SQLx ‚Ä¢ Database: PostgreSQL ‚Ä¢ Frontend: HTML + JS ‚Ä¢ Media: FFmpeg (HLS + watermark) ‚Ä¢ Deployment: Docker / Fly.io / DigitalOcean</p> <p>üí° Why I built it</p> <p>I wanted creators ‚Äî teachers, vloggers, musicians, filmmakers, or anyone who tells stories ‚Äî to have full ownership over their content and income. No ads, no algorithmic throttling, no third-party control.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Edit: Apparently, logging in defer funcs is not that bad. I thought it would be a big do-not. </p> <p>I&#39;m have a question to which I think I already know the answer for, but I&#39;ll still make it because I want more expert reasoning and clearer whys. So let&#39;s Go!</p> <p>Some time ago I was refactoring some old code to implement a better separation of concerns, and when writing the service layer I came up with the idea using defer to &quot;simplify&quot; logging. I thought it was ok in the beginning, but then felt I was falling into an anti-pattern.</p> <p>It is as simple as this:</p> <pre><code>func (sv *MyService) CreateFoo(ctx context.Context, params any) (res foo.Foo, err error) { defer func() { // If there&#39;s an error at the end of the call, log a failure with the err details (could be a bubbled error). // Else, asume foo was created (I already know this might be frown upon lmao) if err != nil { sv.logger.Error(&quot;failed to create foo&quot;, slog.String(&quot;error&quot;, err.Error())) } sv.logger.Info(&quot;foo created successfully&quot;, slog.String(&quot;uid&quot;, string(params.UID)), slog.String(&quot;foo_id&quot;, res.ID), ) }() // Business logic... err = sv.repoA.SomeLogic(ctx, params) if err != nil { return } err = sv.repoB.SomeLogic(ctx, params) if err != nil { return } // Create Foo res, err = sv.repoFoo.Create(ctx, params) if err != nil { return } return } </code></pre> <p>So... Is this an anti-pattern? If so, why? Should I be logging on every if case? What if I have too many cases? For instance, let&#39;s say I call 10 repos in one service and I want to log if any of those calls fail. Should I be copy-pasting the logging instruction in every if error clause instead?</p> <p>note: with this implementation, I would be logging the errors for just the service layer, and maybe the repo if there&#39;s any specific thing that could be lost between layer communication.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AndresElToday"> /u/AndresElToday </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odkd8m/is_using_defer_for_logging_an_antipattern/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odkd8m/is_using_defer_for_logging_an_antipattern/">[comments]</a></span></div>

So naturally I lean towards using Options.</p> <pre><code>type Thing struct { speed int } type Option func(*Thing) func WithSpeed(speed int) Option { return func(t *Thing) { t.speed = speed } } func New(options ...Option) Thing { thing := &amp;Thing{} for _, opt := range options { opt(thing) } return *thing } </code></pre> <p>Now, that&#39;s all fine, but the user can do this:</p> <pre><code>t := thing.New() ... thing.WithSpeed(t) </code></pre> <p>The reason I might not want to do this is it could break the behavior at a later date. I can check options compatibility in the constructor, work with internal defaults, etc...</p> <p>There&#39;s a way to hide this like so:</p> <pre><code>type Option func(configurable) </code></pre> <p>where configurable is my private interface on top of the Thing. But that looks kinda nasty? One big interface to maintain.</p> <p>My question is - what do you use, what have you seen used? Are there better options (ha)? I&#39;d like a simple constructor API and for it to work forever, hidden in the dependency tree, without needing to change a line if it gets updated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mattho"> /u/Mattho </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odfddf/functional_options_pattern_public_or_private/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1odfddf/functional_options_pattern_public_or_private/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I thought that making immutable variables the default is best practice and so from then on I defaulted to immutable variables in every one of my projects as much as I could, but it doesn&#39;t seem like the same happens with some Go projects? Why? If immutable variables are best practice why does it seem like most Go projects don&#39;t use them all that often?

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wonder the preferences on docs structure from different perspectives.</p> <p><strong>Options</strong></p> <p>There are two end of structuring documentation for packages:</p> <ol> <li>Single page (concise, linear)</li> <li>Multiple pages (hierarchical, for breadth &amp; depth)</li> </ol> <p>Single page docs are usually provided in README file, others are either stored in <code>/docs</code> directory or hosted on a separate website. Well-known examples include Gorilla Mux (<a href="https://github.com/gorilla/mux">readme</a>) and Go fiber (<a href="https://docs.gofiber.io">docs site</a>). Gorilla is about 800 lines including TOC etc. A single page docs might be expected to stay under 1000 lines. The other kind can be as shallow as couple pages at one level depth; but they can grow endlessly. Ansible is an example of the latter.</p> <p><strong>Advantages for users</strong></p> <p>The advantages of the single page README approach is the absence of cross references and links to related pages. Single page docs usually feel more concentrated and suffer less from redundancy. Multipage docs are usually better on partial reading, where the focus is recalling a feature or a usage.</p> <p><strong>Advantages for publishers</strong></p> <p>Separate site allows implementing web analytics. Which provides insights on which features get more attraction. Insights are helpful on validating wider applicability although analytics might be a little bit noisy.</p> <p>I found maintaining a single-page docs is far easier as there is less place of an information mentioned I need to update as product shifts.</p> <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p> <p>If you are a publisher, what is your decision process?</p> <p>If you are a user, how many times a type of docs cold you down from learning more about a package?</p> <p>How many lines of a single-page docs is too long to not split up? Threshold relation to number of features, adopters and other factors?</p> <p>Also open to related.</p> <p><em>I might have mistakes on grammar &amp; nuances</em></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ufukty"> /u/ufukty </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1od11w1/community_preference_on_docs_for_packages/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1od11w1/community_preference_on_docs_for_packages/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing some casual graphics programming for a little while. For the past year I&#39;ve had this overly-ambitious idea for a game, similar to Boneworks, with a custom engine and everything! (read on) However, I of course am not experienced enough in the space of graphics programming or physics to rival whatever build of Unity they used for that game, not even mentioning building the game itself.</p> <p>So, I&#39;ve internally shrunk the scope of the game in my mind. I want to put together a simple testing ground, like a developer area in some games, just demonstrating features that I could put together and create a real game out of. I chose Rust for this because it seems to have on-par performance as C++, which virtually all games use, including Unity Engine (though Boneworks uses C# because that&#39;s Unity&#39;s scripting language).</p> <p>Looking into graphics library bindings, I&#39;ve really only seen Vulkano, Ash, and WGPU. I was originally going to use Ash but I&#39;m not patient enough for low-level Vulkan programming, so WGPU it is for me. Now, I have read WGPU, and WebGPU as a whole is just a simplified overhead for a wide range of graphical frameworks, and that the performance could be up to 30% slower or worse in some cases. All of that is fine to me, what&#39;s the point of choosing the more performant library if I just give up anyway and have nothing to show for it.</p> <p>But, for the last part: OpenXR. So, the game would be developed primarily for usage through SteamVR, which I guess somehow connects to the OpenXR bindings, like some driver OpenXR runtime... I guess. I was wondering, with all of this ambition and stupidity laid out, which Rust library I should use for connecting my WGPU game to OpenXR (and maybe even WebXR if I hate myself and my time enough).</p> <p><em>(Additional things: 1. Probably would use egui, seemed irrelevant, but there you go, 2. I heard WGPU overhead for GPU pass is negligible - source:</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/p2ihhz/comment/h8lpfbe/"><em>here</em></a><em>.)</em></p> <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: I chose Rust+WGPU and I am trying to find OpenXR Rust library/bindings for WGPU, and maybe even for WebXR.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/h74v"> /u/h74v </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1oczray/wgpu_openxr_compatibility/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1oczray/wgpu_openxr_compatibility/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Maybe I could leave small gaps between them and add some texture later on, but still, it feels inefficient.</p> <p>I also realized that Bevy + Rapier (both are pretty good), might not fit my needs perfectly because I‚Äôll need to implement extra calculations for elasticity, springs, and material properties.<br/> Bevy Rapier is fantastic for fast physics and collisions, but in my case, I‚Äôll probably need more control so I&#39;m thinking of handling those computations by myself.</p> <p>So, my main question is:</p> <p><strong>Would you still recommend using Bevy for this kind of simulation?</strong> If not, based on your experience, <strong>what other engine would you suggest?</strong> (Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbuild your own‚Äù )</p> <p><a href="https://reddit.com/link/1ocxa67/video/5f39f4ndykwf1/player">https://reddit.com/link/1ocxa67/video/5f39f4ndykwf1/player</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BohrGOD"> /u/BohrGOD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ocxa67/elastic_rods/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust_gamedev/comments/1ocxa67/elastic_rods/">[comments]</a></span></div>
