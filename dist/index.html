            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is an example from something I‚Äôm working on:</p> <p>```</p> <h1>[derive(Clone, Copy)]</h1> <p>pub enum Icon_type {large, small}</p> <h1>[derive(Clone, Copy)]</h1> <p>pub enum Unit_format { symbol, // SI unit symbol (e.g. h, min, s) name, // SI unit name (e.g. hours, minutes, seconds) }</p> <p>pub struct Config { icon_type: Icon_type, unit_format: Unit_format, log_cache: bool, } ```</p> <p>The struct <code>Config</code> has a size of 3 bytes (24 bits), even though it only stores three bits of information! This is because each field is byte-aligned and there‚Äôs padding between fields, so it ends up being one bit, then seven bits of padding, one bit, then saving bits of padding, and then one more bit and an additional seven bits of padding. To fix this issue and make this struct occupy only one byte, we will need to implement bitfields. There are crates for this, but I don‚Äôt like using too many dependencies so I figured out how to implement them on my own. I‚Äôm sharing my implementation here and I hope people will find it useful.</p> <p>```</p> <h1>[derive(Clone, Copy)]</h1> <p>pub enum Icon_type {large, small}</p> <h1>[derive(Clone, Copy)]</h1> <p>pub enum Unit_format { symbol, // SI unit symbol (e.g. h, min, s) name, // SI unit name (e.g. hours, minutes, seconds) }</p> <p>// Fields: // - icon_type: Icon_type // - unit_format: Unit_format // - log_cache: bool</p> <h1>[derive(Clone, Copy)]</h1> <p>pub struct Bitfields(u8);</p> <p>impl Bitfields { const ICON_TYPE_NUM: u8 = 0; const UNIT_FORMAT_NUM: u8 = 1; const LOG_CACHE_NUM: u8 = 2;</p> <pre><code>pub fn new(icon_type: Icon_type, unit_format: Unit_format, log_cache: bool) -&gt; Self { Bitfields(0) .set_icon_type(icon_type) .set_unit_format(unit_format) .set_log_cache(log_cache) } pub fn set_icon_type(self, icon_type: Icon_type) -&gt; Self { let num = self.0 | (icon_type as u8) &lt;&lt; Self::ICON_TYPE_NUM; Bitfields(num) } pub fn set_unit_format(self, unit_format: Unit_format) -&gt; Self { let num = self.0 | (unit_format as u8) &lt;&lt; Self::UNIT_FORMAT_NUM; Bitfields(num) } pub fn set_log_cache(self, log_cache: bool) -&gt; Self { let num = self.0 | (log_cache as u8) &lt;&lt; Self::LOG_CACHE_NUM; Bitfields(num) } pub fn icon_type(self) -&gt; Icon_type { match (self.0 &gt;&gt; Self::ICON_TYPE_NUM) &amp; 1 { 0 =&gt; Icon_type::large, _ =&gt; Icon_type::small, } } pub fn unit_format(self) -&gt; Unit_format { match (self.0 &gt;&gt; Self::UNIT_FORMAT_NUM) &amp; 1 { 0 =&gt; Unit_format::symbol, _ =&gt; Unit_format::name, } } pub fn log_cache(self) -&gt; bool { (self.0 &gt;&gt; Self::LOG_CACHE_NUM) &amp; 1 != 0 } </code></pre> <p>} ```</p> <p>Then, you use the <code>Bitfields::new</code> function to contstruct the structure, the setter methods to change a field, and the getter methods to get the fields. It abstracts the bitwise arithmetic necessary to get and set the fields. I wish this was built-in to the language, but it‚Äôs actually pretty simple to implement it yourself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SaltyMaybe7887"> /u/SaltyMaybe7887 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jx1lh0/tip_implementing_bitfields_to_save_memory_in_rust/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jx1lh0/tip_implementing_bitfields_to_save_memory_in_rust/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Most of my experience with network services has involved I/O-bound code, where managing a single thread is simpler and very often one thread can handle huge amount of connections. For me, it appears more straightforward to develop using a single-threaded runtime‚Äîand then, if performance becomes an issue, simply scale out by spawning additional processes.</p> <p>I understand that multithreading can be better when software is CPU-bound.</p> <p>However, from my perspective, the default to a multithreaded runtime increases the complexity (e.g., requiring <code>Arc</code> and <code>&#39;static</code> lifetime guarantees) which might be overkill for many I/O-bound services. Do people with many years of experience feel that this trade-off is justified overall, or would a single-threaded runtime be a more natural default for the majority of use cases?</p> <p>While I know that a multiprocess approach can use slightly more resources compared to a multithreaded one, afaik the difference seems small compared to the simplicity gains in development.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/zl0bster"> /u/zl0bster </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jwp8jo/do_most_people_agree_that_the_multithreaded/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jwp8jo/do_most_people_agree_that_the_multithreaded/">[comments]</a></span></div>

I have never used AI for coding ever before. I&#39;m very sure this is the worst subreddit to post this in. Please suggest a more fitting one if there is one.</p> <p>So I was trying out egui and how to integrate it into an existing Wgpu + winit codebase for a debug menu. At one point I was so stuck with egui&#39;s documentation that I desperately needed help. Called some of my colleagues but none of them had experience with egui. Instead of wasting someone&#39;s time on reddit helping me with my horrendous code, I left my desk, sat down on my bed and doom scrolled Instagram for around five minutes until I saw someone showcasing Claudes &quot;impressive&quot; coding performance. It was actually something pretty basic in Python, however I thought: &quot;Maybe these AIs could help me. After all, everyone is saying they&#39;re going to replace us anyway.&quot;</p> <p>Yeah I did just that. Created an Anthropic account, made sure I was using the 3.7 model of Claude and carefully explained my issue to the AI. Not a second later I was presented with a nice answer. I thought: &quot;Man, this is pretty cool. Maybe this isn&#39;t as bad as I thought?&quot;</p> <p>I really hoped this would work, however I got excited way too soon. Claude completely refactored the function I provided to the point where it was unusable in my current setup. Not only that, but it mixed deprecated winit API (WindowBuilder for example, which was removed in 0.30.0 I believe) and hallucinated non-existent winit and Wgpu API. This was really bad. I tried my best getting it on the right track but soon after, my daily limit was hit.</p> <p>I tried the same with ChatGPT and DeepSeek. All three showed similar results, with ChatGPT giving me the best answer that made the program compile but introduced various other bugs.</p> <p>Two hours later I asked for help on a discord server and soon after, someone offered me help. Hopped on a call with him and every issue was resolved within minutes. The issue was actually something pretty simple too (wrong return type for a function) and I was really embarrassed I didn&#39;t notice that sooner.</p> <p>Anyway, I just had a terrible experience with AI today and I&#39;m totally unimpressed. I can&#39;t believe some people seriously think AI is going to replace software engineers. It seems to struggle with anything beyond printing &quot;Hello, World!&quot;. These big tech CEOs have been taking about how AI is going to replace software developers for years but it seems like nothing has really changed for now. I&#39;m also wondering if Rust in particular is a language where AI is still lacking.</p> <p>Did I do something wrong or is this whole hype nothing more than a money grab?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PalowPower"> /u/PalowPower </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jworgh/ai_is_going_to_replace_software_developers_they/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jworgh/ai_is_going_to_replace_software_developers_they/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>The problem</h1> <p>Okay, may you are asking yourself, why you do a project in Golang with no packages or libraries? First, the project requires an highly optimized database, high concurrency and a lot of performance, a lot of files and a lot of data. So, I thought, why not do it in Golang?</p> <p>The project it is about to make a conciliation with a different types of invoices reading <code>XML</code> in two differents ways. First, it is using an API (easy) the second it&#39;s in a dynamic database location (hard). The two ways give me only <code>XML</code> files, so I need to parse them and make a conciliation with the data. Also, when I get the conciliated invoices, that concilitation needs to be saved in a database. So, I need to make a lot of queries and a lot of data manipulation, and the hardest part is to make all this in a high performance way, when the data is conciliated the user will be able to sort and filter in the data.</p> <h1>The solution</h1> <p>That is the problem. Using <code>Go</code> was the best decission for this project, but why no packages? Not easy answer here, but I need to have a FULL control of the database, the querys, indexes, tables, and all the data. Even I need to control the database configuration. <code>GORM</code> do not let me to customize every aspect of a table or column.</p> <p>Then another problem is a high concurrency with the two ways of getting data in different sources (And compress the <code>XML</code> because it is a HUGE amount of data) and then parse it. So, I need to make a lot of goroutines and channels to make the data flow.</p> <p>Every pieces are on the table. Next lets see the structure project!</p> <p><code>markdown |-- src | |-- config | |-- controller | |-- database | |-- handlers | |-- interfaces | |-- middleware | |-- models | |-- routes | |-- services | |-- utils </code></p> <p>Very simple, but very effective. I have a <code>config</code> folder to store all the configuration of the project, like the database connection, the API keys, etc. The <code>controller</code> folder as a bussiness logic headers, the <code>database</code> folder as the database connection and the queries, the <code>handlers</code> folder as the HTTP handlers, the <code>interfaces</code> folder as the interfaces declared for the petitions in others APIs, the <code>middleware</code> folder for CORS and , the <code>models</code> folder as the models for the database, the <code>routes</code> folder as the routes of the project, the <code>services</code> folder as the services of the project and finally the <code>utils</code> folder as a utility functions.</p> <h1>How the data is managed</h1> <p>Now, lets talk about my database configuration, but please, keep in mind, that this configuration only works in MY situation, and this is the best only in this case, may not be useful in another cases. And visualize that every table has indexes.</p> <h3><code>listen_addresses = &#39;*&#39;</code></h3> <p>Configures which IP addresses PostgreSQL listens on. Setting this to <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> allows connections from any IP address, making the database accessible from any network interface. Useful for servers that need to accept connections from multiple clients on different networks.</p> <h3><code>shared_buffers = 256MB</code></h3> <p>Determines the amount of memory dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data. This is one of the most important parameters for performance, as it caches frequently accessed tables and indexes in RAM. 256MB is a moderate value that balances memory usage with improved query performance. For high-performance systems, this could be set to 25% of total system memory.</p> <h3><code>work_mem = 16MB</code></h3> <p>Specifies the memory allocated for sort operations and hash tables. Each query operation can use this amount of memory, so 16MB provides a reasonable balance. Setting this too high could lead to memory pressure if many queries run concurrently, while setting it too low forces PostgreSQL to use disk-based sorting.</p> <h3><code>maintenance_work_mem = 128MB</code></h3> <p>Defines memory dedicated to maintenance operations like VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, or ALTER TABLE. Higher values (like 128MB) accelerate these operations, especially on larger tables. This memory is only used during maintenance tasks, so it can safely be set higher than <code>work_mem</code>.</p> <h3><code>wal_buffers = 16MB</code></h3> <p>Controls the size of the buffer for Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data before writing to disk. 16MB is sufficient for most workloads and helps reduce I/O pressure by batching WAL writes.</p> <h3><code>synchronous_commit = off</code></h3> <p>Disables waiting for WAL writes to be confirmed as written to disk before reporting success to clients. This dramatically improves performance by allowing the server to continue processing transactions immediately, at the cost of a small risk of data loss in case of system failure (typically just a few recent transactions).</p> <h3><code>checkpoint_timeout = 15min</code></h3> <p>Sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints. A longer interval (15 minutes) reduces I/O load by spacing out checkpoint operations but may increase recovery time after a crash.</p> <h3><code>max_wal_size = 1GB</code></h3> <p>Defines the maximum size of WAL files before triggering a checkpoint. 1GB allows for efficient handling of large transaction volumes before forcing a disk write.</p> <h3><code>min_wal_size = 80MB</code></h3> <p>Sets the minimum size to shrink the WAL to during checkpoint operations. Keeping at least 80MB prevents excessive recycling of WAL files, which would cause unnecessary I/O.</p> <h3><code>random_page_cost = 1.1</code></h3> <p>An estimate of the cost of fetching a non-sequential disk page. The low value of 1.1 (close to 1.0) indicates the system is using SSDs or has excellent disk caching. This guides the query planner to prefer index scans over sequential scans.</p> <h3><code>effective_cache_size = 512MB</code></h3> <p>Tells the query planner how much memory is available for disk caching by the OS and PostgreSQL. 512MB indicates a moderate amount of system memory available for caching, influencing the planner to favor index scans.</p> <h3><code>max_connections = 100</code></h3> <p>Limits the number of simultaneous client connections. 100 connections is suitable for applications with moderate concurrency requirements while preventing resource exhaustion.</p> <h3><code>max_worker_processes = 4</code></h3> <p>Sets the maximum number of background worker processes the system can support. 4 workers allows parallel operations while preventing CPU oversubscription on smaller systems.</p> <h3><code>max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2</code></h3> <p>Defines how many worker processes a single Gather operation can launch. Setting this to 2 enables moderate parallelism for individual queries.</p> <h3><code>max_parallel_workers = 4</code></h3> <p>Limits the total number of parallel workers that can be active at once. Matching this with <code>max_worker_processes</code> ensures all worker slots can be used for parallelism if needed.</p> <h3><code>log_min_duration_statement = 200</code></h3> <p>Logs any query that runs longer than 200 milliseconds. This helps identify slow-performing queries that might need optimization, while not logging faster queries that would create excessive log volume.</p> <h2>Table declarations</h2> <p>Obviusly I will not put here every table created and every column (Also the names are changed) but this is a general idea.</p> <p>```sql CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reconciliation ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, requester_id VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL, request_uuid VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL UNIQUE, company_id VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );</p> <p>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_request_uuid ON reconciliation(request_uuid); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_requester_id ON reconciliation(requester_id); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_company_id ON reconciliation(company_id);</p> <p>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reconciliation_invoice ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Imagine 30 columns declarations... created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, FOREIGN KEY (reconciliation_id) REFERENCES reconciliation(id) ON DELETE CASCADE );</p> <p>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_invoice_reconciliation_id ON reconciliation_invoice(reconciliation_id); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_invoice_source_uuid ON reconciliation_invoice(source_system_uuid); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_invoice_erp_uuid ON reconciliation_invoice(erp_system_uuid); CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_invoice_reconciled ON reconciliation_invoice(reconciled);</p> <p>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reconciliation_stats ( reconciliation_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES reconciliation(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- ... A lot of more stats props document_type_stats JSONB NOT NULL, total_distribution JSONB NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );</p> <p>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reconciliation_stats_reconciliation_id ON reconciliation_stats(reconciliation_id); ```</p> <h3>Index Explanations</h3> <p>The schema includes several strategic indexes to optimize query performance:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Primary Key Indexes</strong>: Each table has a primary key that automatically creates an index for fast record retrieval by ID.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Foreign Key Indexes</strong>:</p></li> </ol> <ul> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_invoice_reconciliation_id</code> enables efficient joins between reconciliation and invoice tables</li> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_stats_reconciliation_id</code> optimizes queries joining stats to their parent reconciliation</li> </ul> <ol> <li><strong>Lookup Indexes</strong>:</li> </ol> <ul> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_request_uuid</code> for fast lookups by unique request identifier</li> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_requester_id</code> and <code>idx_reconciliation_company_id</code> optimize filtering by company or requester</li> </ul> <ol> <li><strong>Business Logic Indexes</strong>: <ul> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_invoice_source_uuid</code> and <code>idx_reconciliation_invoice_erp_uuid</code> improve performance when matching documents between systems</li> <li><code>idx_reconciliation_invoice_reconciled</code> optimizes filtering by reconciliation status, which is likely a common query pattern</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>These indexes significantly improve performance for the typical query patterns in a reconciliation system, where you often need to filter by company, requester, or match status, while potentially handling large volumes of invoice data.</p> <h1>How I handle the XML</h1> <p>The KEY of why use <code>Go</code> it was by how EASY is to use <code>XML</code> in <code>Go</code> (I am really in love and save HOURS). Maybe you never see an <code>XML</code>, this is a fake example of an <code>XML</code> invoice:</p> <p><code>xml &lt;Invoice xmlns:qdt=&quot;urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:QualifiedDatatypes-2&quot; ... &lt;/cac:OrderReference&gt; &lt;cac:AccountingSupplierParty&gt; ... &lt;/cac:AccountingSupplierParty&gt; &lt;cac:AccountingCustomerParty&gt; ... &lt;/cac:AccountingCustomerParty&gt; &lt;cac:Delivery&gt; ... &lt;/cac:Delivery&gt; &lt;cac:PaymentMeans&gt; ... &lt;/cac:PaymentMeans&gt; &lt;cac:PaymentTerms&gt; ... &lt;/cac:PaymentTerms&gt; &lt;cac:AllowanceCharge&gt; ... &lt;/cac:AllowanceCharge&gt; &lt;cac:TaxTotal&gt; &lt;cbc:TaxAmount currencyID=&quot;GBP&quot;&gt;17.50&lt;/cbc:TaxAmount&gt; &lt;cbc:TaxEvidenceIndicator&gt;true&lt;/cbc:TaxEvidenceIndicator&gt; &lt;cac:TaxSubtotal&gt; &lt;cbc:TaxableAmount currencyID=&quot;GBP&quot;&gt;100.00&lt;/cbc:TaxableAmount&gt; &lt;cbc:TaxAmount currencyID=&quot;GBP&quot;&gt;17.50&lt;/cbc:TaxAmount&gt; &lt;cac:TaxCategory&gt; &lt;cbc:ID&gt;A&lt;/cbc:ID&gt; &lt;cac:TaxScheme&gt; &lt;cbc:ID&gt;UK VAT&lt;/cbc:ID&gt; &lt;cbc:TaxTypeCode&gt;VAT&lt;/cbc:TaxTypeCode&gt; &lt;/cac:TaxScheme&gt; &lt;/cac:TaxCategory&gt; &lt;/cac:TaxSubtotal&gt; &lt;/cac:TaxTotal&gt; &lt;cac:LegalMonetaryTotal&gt; ... &lt;/cac:LegalMonetaryTotal&gt; &lt;cac:InvoiceLine&gt; ... &lt;/cac:InvoiceLine&gt; &lt;/Invoice&gt; </code></p> <p>In another language may can be PAINFUL to extract this data and more when the data have a child in a child in a child...</p> <p>This is an interface example in <code>Go</code>:</p> <p>``<code>go type Invoice struct { ID string</code>xml:&quot;ID&quot;<code> IssueDate string</code>xml:&quot;IssueDate&quot;<code> SupplierParty Party</code>xml:&quot;AccountingSupplierParty&quot;<code> CustomerParty Party</code>xml:&quot;AccountingCustomerParty&quot;<code> TaxTotal struct { TaxAmount string</code>xml:&quot;TaxAmount&quot;<code> EvidenceIndicator bool</code>xml:&quot;TaxEvidenceIndicator&quot;<code> // Handling deeply nested elements Subtotals []struct { TaxableAmount string</code>xml:&quot;TaxableAmount&quot;<code> TaxAmount string</code>xml:&quot;TaxAmount&quot;<code> // Even deeper nesting Category struct { ID string</code>xml:&quot;ID&quot;<code> Scheme struct { ID string</code>xml:&quot;ID&quot;<code> TypeCode string</code>xml:&quot;TaxTypeCode&quot;<code> }</code>xml:&quot;TaxScheme&quot;<code> }</code>xml:&quot;TaxCategory&quot;<code> }</code>xml:&quot;TaxSubtotal&quot;<code> }</code>xml:&quot;TaxTotal&quot;` }</p> <p>type Party struct { Name string <code>xml:&quot;Party&gt;PartyName&gt;Name&quot;</code> TaxID string <code>xml:&quot;Party&gt;PartyTaxScheme&gt;CompanyID&quot;</code> // Other fields omitted... } ```</p> <p>Very easy, right? With an interface we got everything ready to work extracting data and save from our APIs!</p> <h1>Concurrency</h1> <p>Another aspect of why go for <code>Go</code> is the concurrency. Why this project needs concurrency? Okay, lets see a diagram of how the data flow:</p> <p>![Image description](<a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cp9eggiz8wbmc1x06ai1.png">https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cp9eggiz8wbmc1x06ai1.png</a>)</p> <p>Imagine, if I process every package one by one, I will be waiting a lot of time to process all the data. So, its the perfect time to use goroutines and channels.</p> <p>![Image description](<a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7atnxops54vj10zeyby1.png">https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7atnxops54vj10zeyby1.png</a>)</p> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>After completing this project with pure Go and no external dependencies, I can confidently say this approach was the right choice for this specific use case. The standard library proved to be remarkably capable, handling everything from complex XML parsing to high-throughput database operations.</p> <p>The key advantages I gained were:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Complete control over performance optimization</strong> - By writing raw SQL queries and fine-tuning PostgreSQL configuration, I achieved performance levels that would be difficult with an ORM&#39;s abstractions.</p></li> <li><p><strong>No dependency management headaches</strong> - Zero external packages meant no version conflicts, security vulnerabilities from third-party code, or unexpected breaking changes.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Smaller binary size and reduced overhead</strong> - The resulting application was lean and efficient, with no unused code from large libraries.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Deep understanding of the system</strong> - Building everything from scratch forced me to understand each component thoroughly, making debugging and optimization much easier.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Perfect fit for Go&#39;s strengths</strong> - This approach leveraged Go&#39;s strongest features: concurrency with goroutines/channels, efficient XML handling, and a powerful standard library.</p></li> </ol> <p>That said, this isn&#39;t the right approach for every project. The development time was longer than it would have been with established libraries and frameworks. For simpler applications or rapid prototyping, the convenience of packages like GORM or Echo would likely outweigh the benefits of going dependency-free.</p> <p>However, for systems with strict performance requirements handling large volumes of data with complex processing needs, the control offered by this bare-bones approach proved invaluable. The reconciliation system now processes millions of invoices efficiently, with predictable performance characteristics and complete visibility into every aspect of its operation.</p> <p>In the end, the most important lesson was knowing when to embrace libraries and when to rely on Go&#39;s powerful standard library - a decision that should always be driven by the specific requirements of your project rather than dogmatic principles about dependencies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Academic_Estate7807"> /u/Academic_Estate7807 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jwxfqr/i_made_a_project_in_golang_with_no_packages_or/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jwxfqr/i_made_a_project_in_golang_with_no_packages_or/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If there is better place to share, let me know! This is my first long post in a long while. There&#39;s a lot of you making RTS games, and I applaud you for it! Those of you uninitiated, might find this interesting. I&#39;ve been longing to write on the subject, so here goes. For transparency I&#39;ll add that I also have posted this on my website.</p> <p>This is part of a short series which will lay out a <strong>general</strong> technical introduction to real-time strategy games. In this post, I&#39;ll try to convince you to make one and lay out some of the core systems. If you&#39;ve already made one, or are deep in the process of making one, you might find a lot of this repetitive. It&#39;s largely aimed at those not too familiar with the genre in technical terms. <strong>It&#39;s not a tutorial</strong>. Either way, I hope that it will give you some insight.</p> <p>Alright, real-time strategy (RTS) games in all their forms have always been my go-to genre. For me, it started with <em>Age of Empires I</em> when I was around eight years old. My friend&#39;s dad had acquired the magical capability of burning games to CDs. To my disbelief and joy, he handed me a copy like it was nothing. <strong>Oh boy!</strong></p> <p>I was fascinated. I remember sessions where I was just constructing walls and trying to trap the AI villagers within them. Later came <em>Empire Earth</em>, which has since held a special place in my heart, then <em>Warcraft III</em> and <em>Age of Mythology</em> ‚Äî games I started to mod. <em>Warcraft III</em> and its visual scripting system with Triggers was my gateway to programming. I thank Blizzard and its developers for that.</p> <p>Your journey might sound similar, perhaps swapping in or adding titles like <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, <em>Total Annihilation</em>, or <em>Rise of Nations</em>.</p> <h1>What are real-time strategy games?</h1> <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) games are a genre of video games where players control armies, build bases, gather resources, and make strategic decisions ‚Äî all happening continuously in real time, not turn-by-turn. Players typically manage many units and buildings at once, issuing orders like moving troops, constructing buildings, or attacking enemies, while your opponents (human or AI) are doing the same at the same time. The key challenge is multitasking under pressure: balancing economy, defense, and offense ‚Äî often with limited information.</p> <p>Chess on steroids, one might say.</p> <p>Around <strong>thirteen years ago</strong>, I started making my own real-time strategy game. It&#39;s not released ‚Äî I&#39;ve changed engines or frameworks twice and admittedly left it to collect dust for a few years at a time. Over time I realized that for me, <em>programming</em> was <strong>the game</strong> ‚Äî and <em>learning</em> was <strong>the reward</strong>. I was obsessed and had so much fun, sometimes staying up for more than 48 hours straight. <sup>Something which I will not be held responsible for if you do.</sup></p> <p>There&#39;s so much to learn from making one, and that&#39;s why <strong>I recommend you make a real-time strategy game</strong>. It lays the foundation for so many other genres. Almost whenever I prototype a new idea, I fire up a new fork of my RTS-project, since it entails so many commonly used systems. Early versions of <em>World of Warcraft</em> are said to have been based on <em>Warcraft III</em>. <strong>I believe that once you can build one, you are experienced enough to tackle almost any other genre</strong>.</p> <h1>Basics</h1> <p>Before we begin, you might be wondering what <strong>Game Engine</strong> to use. To be fair, <strong>whatever you are familiar with</strong>. The systems we&#39;ll cover are engine-independent. My own project started in the Microsoft XNA Framework and is currently engine-independent, although implemented in Unity for visual and personal preference. If you&#39;re just starting out with game development, <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> is a good choice. Solid alternatives are <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine</a>, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and <a href="https://monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>.</p> <p>The very few samples of code in these articles assume usage of Unity and C#.</p> <p>No matter what you choose however, <strong>try to structure your code to be as engine-independent as possible</strong>. This will:</p> <ul> <li>ensure you have total control of what is going on with your systems, and prevent external updates from affecting your game logic</li> <li>help immensely if you ever change frameworks or engine,</li> <li>and make you a better programmer in general, <em>I believe</em>.</li> </ul> <p>So, what do real-time strategy games entail technically speaking? Let&#39;s put the two most basic components down first, as these are fundamental to the systems explained further below.</p> <h1>Units</h1> <p>Units are characters in the world ‚Äî produced, controlled, and (usually) sent to their own destruction by the player. They need defensive stats (armor, health) and offensive capabilities (auto-attacks, abilities). Some gather resources. Others might enter buildings or transports. Some can fly, swim, or phase through terrain.</p> <h1>Tiles</h1> <p>For this article, I&#39;ll assume the game (and recommend if you&#39;re starting out) has a square grid. Divide your map into, say, 128√ó128 tiles ‚Äî as in 16,384 cells total. These are the atoms of your map and the basis for much of your logic and optimization later.</p> <p>Each tile has a coordinate, e.g., <code>X=0, Y=0</code> in one corner up to <code>X=127, Y=127</code> in the opposite corner. Tiles are static in position, but their state may change: a tile might become &quot;Blocked&quot; when a building is placed, and revert to &quot;Walkable&quot; if that building is destroyed. They may also have an enum to describe their type, e.g., &quot;Land&quot;, &quot;Sea&quot;.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thungsten.com/attachments/a0_gridsystem.webp">A basic grid system, overlayed on a 3D game world.</a></p> <h1>Pathfinding</h1> <p>Alright, so that&#39;s the essentials we need to know for now. For a unit to get anywhere, it needs to <strong>find a path around obstacles</strong>. I have a vivid memory of a childhood friend who claimed he had &quot;hacked&quot; Age of Empires by sending a unit across the unexplored map ‚Äî and to his amazement, the unit found its way there, even though he had no idea how. That&#39;s pathfinding at work.</p> <p>Say you have a unit and you want to order it to move to the other side of a forest (<em>hint: first you need a selection system</em>). Without pathfinding, it would move straight ahead and get stuck against the first tree. Not ideal. Other blocking parts of the map are typically water and buildings. Some units might traverse water, and others like birds, flying creatures, rockets, or planes might be unobstructed as they move around the map.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thungsten.com/attachments/a0_pathfinding.mp4">Pathfinding being performed in debug mode in a 3D game world. Gray tiles are tested, green yet to be tested and red tiles the final path.</a></p> <p>To make a functional RTS, you&#39;ll need to understand pathfinding ‚Äî and ideally, implement it yourself. I hope and recommend that you do. Look into the A* algorithm.</p> <h1>A* (A-Star) algorithm</h1> <p>A* is a way to find the best path from one place to another ‚Äî like how a GPS finds the shortest route. It looks at all possible paths but tries to be efficient by picking the most promising ones first. It does this by thinking about two things: how far it&#39;s already traveled, and how far it thinks it has left to go. By combining those two, it avoids wasting time checking every single option, and usually finds the shortest or fastest path pretty quickly. It&#39;s used in games, software and simulations to move characters around maps without bumping into walls or taking weird routes.</p> <p>Searches over large maps are performance heavy, so you should try to run it as seldom as possible.</p> <p>Once you get the first version working, you&#39;ll feel rightfully accomplished. Later, you&#39;ll want to optimize. Here&#39;s some tips on further reading, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redblobgames/">u/redblobgames</a> in particular has some really great posts on the subject.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* search algorithm</a>, Wikipedia</li> <li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">Introduction to the A* Algorithm</a>, u/redblobgames, Jul 2023</li> <li><a href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/implementation.html">Implementation of A*</a>, u/redblobgames, Feb 2022</li> </ul> <h1>Fog of War</h1> <p>If you&#39;ve played RTS games, you know the faded or dark parts of the map ‚Äî that&#39;s Fog of War. Units provide vision, usually in a radius around them. Some buildings, like watchtowers, extend vision further. Depending on the game, a match might start with the whole map unexplored ‚Äî pitch black apart from your base. When you move units around, they explore new areas.</p> <p>As you send your medieval peasants into the unknown, they might stumble across a gold mine. The area lights up as they move. But when they continue past it, that same area becomes slightly faded ‚Äî <em>explored</em>, but not <em>visible</em>. It&#39;s a memory of sorts. Return 15 minutes later and you might find buildings belonging to a hostile player and an almost-emptied mine.</p> <p>This is where we use the tiles again, each generally has three possible visibility states:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Visible</strong>: the current, &quot;real&quot; state of things.</li> <li><strong>Explored</strong>: faded, a remembered state ‚Äî static objects may be shown, but not units or projectiles.</li> <li><strong>Unexplored</strong>: pitch black, nothing is known.</li> </ul> <p>Say you never return to that gold mine, but try to place a resource hut near it. In reality, another building is there ‚Äî but you don&#39;t know that. The game should allow you to go ahead with the order. If it didn&#39;t, you could easily &quot;maphack&quot; by hovering over the map while in the planning mode of a construction order. Something that at least <em>Empire Earth</em> actually allows.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thungsten.com/attachments/a0_ee.webp">Screenshot of Empire Earth. On the left, the player in planning mode of a large building ‚Äî incorrectly showing red lines where the tiles are blocked, even though the player doesn&#39;t know. On the right, the same area visible.</a></p> <p>Once you regain vision, the order should be cancelled automatically. This is the general behavior of games in the genre, at least. Likewise, the game should not let you place a hut directly on your memory of the gold mine, even if it&#39;s long gone (because you don&#39;t know that).</p> <p>This means that each player (human or bot) has their own &quot;reality&quot;. So there is no single &quot;truth&quot; to reference in your code. This is one of those deceptively complex systems that&#39;s often forgotten ‚Äî and eye-opening to implement. I recommend that you do.</p> <p>Once you have basic fog of war with units and buildings projecting vision in a radius, you&#39;ll eventually want obstacles like forests to block vision. This blends into <strong>Field of View (FOV)</strong> territory. That&#39;s where more complex vision algorithms come in ‚Äî both for logic and visual representation. Some reading I recommend:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/story-fog-and-war">A Story of Fog and War</a>, Riot Games, May 13, 2016</li> <li><a href="https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Comparative_study_of_field_of_view_algorithms_for_2D_grid_based_worlds">Comparative Study of Field of View Algorithms for 2D Grid-Based Worlds</a>, Jice, February 2009</li> </ul> <h1>Pathfinding and Fog of War</h1> <p>You may want your pathfinding to use player memory ‚Äî or not. Think about it. Let&#39;s say there is a small passage through some mountains. The enemy has built a wall there, <strong>you know that since you have explored it</strong>. If you order some units to move to the other side, they wouldn&#39;t try to go through the wall. But the wall has been destroyed! Should the pathfinding &quot;know&quot; that, and move forward, or path around?</p> <p>If pathfinding is always based on the &quot;real state&quot;, players could use this to their advantage. One could start an order and see where the units start moving, and then cancel it ‚Äî only to gain some knowledge that is actually not available to the player in the world view.</p> <p>It&#39;d be annoying to realize much later that all ones units have needlessly travelled double the distance to avoid a wall that does not even exist. Perhaps equally annoying if the units always walked up to the wall before they started pathing &quot;correctly&quot;.</p> <p>Depending on the nature of the game, the advantage or disadvantage that the choice brings here might not mean much, but it&#39;s interesting to ponder about.</p> <h1>Task System</h1> <p>At this point, your unit can move and see. But it also needs to <strong>attack</strong>, <strong>gather resources</strong>, and <strong>perform abilities</strong> like casting fireballs or laying traps. Without structure, you&#39;ll quickly end up with the worst spaghetti code you&#39;ve ever tasted. Every new action becomes another tangled ingredient.</p> <p>You need a <strong>modular task system</strong>. Each unit should queue and execute tasks, but not care about the internal logic of those tasks. In other words, the unit shouldn&#39;t need to know how to chop wood or attack a unit ‚Äî it should only know that it has a task to perform. Here are a few example of the most common tasks you might want to implement:</p> <ul> <li><code>AttackOrder</code>: needs a target unit or building</li> <li><code>MoveOrder</code>: needs a target position, with an option to attack-move</li> <li><code>ConstructOrder</code>: needs building type and position</li> <li><code>GatherOrder</code>: needs a target resource</li> <li><code>StoreResourcesOrder</code>: needs a building target which can store resources</li> <li><code>PatrolOrder</code>: needs a target position</li> </ul> <p>Again, in an object-oriented manner, a task object ‚Äî not the unit ‚Äî should handle what it means to chop wood or shoot an arrow. I recommend you make a reusable system here. You&#39;ll use it in future projects with characters or agents. With it in place, adding new orders is a breeze.</p> <h1>Types, Instances and Data</h1> <p>All of these systems ‚Äî pathfinding, fog of war and the task system ‚Äî don&#39;t work in isolation. They rely on <strong>data</strong>.</p> <p>How fast a unit moves, whether it can swim or climb mountains, its&#39; vision radius, attack type, whether it&#39;s a fighter or a pacifist ‚Äî all this is <strong>type data</strong>, <em>shared between units of the same kind</em>. You&#39;ll probably have a class like <code>UnitType</code> holding this data.</p> <p>There&#39;s no need for every warrior to store its <code>uint MaxHealth</code> and <code>string Name</code> individually ‚Äî just reference the shared type.</p> <h1>Regarding buffs</h1> <p>If you add a buff system later, allow some override, but fall back to the base type when no buffs are active.</p> <p>You&#39;ll likely start with a few common types, something like: a villager, a warrior, and an archer. The villager is responsible for crafting buildings, we need to specify which ones, and gathering resources; all or only specific kinds? The warrior is probably an offensive unit, which can hit others in melee range. And finally the archer, capable of firing arrows. All these unit types are instances of <code>UnitType</code>, referenced by <code>Unit</code> instances.</p> <p>Think of Types as templates. It&#39;s a reference, <strong>not inheritance</strong>.</p> <p>Each <code>Unit</code> <strong>instance</strong> also has its own data: <code>uint Health</code> (meaning current), <code>Vector3 Position</code>, <code>OrderManager Orders</code>, etc. <strong>This</strong> is what you&#39;ll be exporting and importing when the user saves and loads a game. The <strong>type data</strong>, defined by you, on the other hand, exists once per unit type and is loaded at startup.</p> <p>Over time, you&#39;ll likely end up with <code>UnitType</code>, <code>BuildingType</code>, <code>TileType</code> and so on. Good!</p> <h1>Save data externally</h1> <p><strong>Avoid hardcoding type data</strong>. Otherwise, every small change requires a new build; it&#39;ll be stored in your <code>.exe</code> or <code>.dll</code>. Store as much data as you can in external files. In doing so, you <strong>automatically add some modding capabilities</strong> to your game. <em>Warcraft III</em> succeeded ‚Äî and still survives ‚Äî in part because of this.</p> <p>It also makes collaboration easier: designers can tweak values while developers focus on systems. Use a known format like JSON ‚Äî or roll your own, which is a great learning experience, I recommend it.</p> <p>The file extension itself, <code>.xml</code>, <code>.json</code>, or whatever does not matter much, other than for certain operating systems to know which application to open a file with. If you make your own editor (we&#39;ll get there too, hold on) you might be interested in this. In your installer you&#39;ll add information so that the machine knows that <code>.rtsmap</code> opens with your editor. If you have no need for this, be friendly to modders and simply save them as <code>.txt</code> files. It&#39;s the data within that matters.</p> <h1>Wrapping Up</h1> <p>By now, we&#39;ve touched on some of the core systems you need to implement.</p> <p>Luckily, all of these systems apply to <strong>RPGs</strong>, <strong>roguelikes</strong>, <strong>MOBAs</strong>, and more. If you build a real-time strategy game, <em>which I recommend you do</em>, and never even release the game, you&#39;ll have learned a lot ‚Äî and hopefully, you had fun doing it.</p> <p>In the following parts, I&#39;ll write about <strong>map editors</strong>, <strong>debugging</strong> and go into some of the more specific systems related to the real-time strategy genre ‚Äî such as <strong>multiplayer</strong>, <strong>unit formations</strong> and <strong>optimization</strong>.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed this introduction to real-time strategy games.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/develop01c"> /u/develop01c </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jwwgb9/i_recommend_you_novice_devs_to_make_a_realtime/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jwwgb9/i_recommend_you_novice_devs_to_make_a_realtime/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I‚Äôm over 30 years old now. In my country, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to find a job at this age. My wife is also unemployed, and we‚Äôve been raising our 1-year-old son using what‚Äôs left of our savings from the past.</p> <p>That‚Äôs why I decided to take a leap and become a solo game developer. Partly to find a new way to make a living, and partly because I wanted to create something meaningful ‚Äî something my son can look at one day and say, <em>‚ÄúMy dad made this, all by himself.‚Äù</em></p> <p>My game is nearly finished. It‚Äôs already passed Valve‚Äôs review, and I‚Äôm in the testing phase, hunting for bugs and making sure it‚Äôs stable. I‚Äôm planning to release it either this month or next.</p> <p>Even though my country isn‚Äôt included in the U.S. income tax treaties ‚Äî meaning I lose an extra 30% to taxes ‚Äî I‚Äôve still priced the game quite low, because I want people to be able to play it. The profit I make is tiny, but I felt it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>What makes things more uncertain is the state of the world right now ‚Äî the global trade war, and what might come next. My country is currently facing a 46% tariff from the U.S., and negotiating lower rates has been close to impossible.</p> <p>If things escalate further, I worry that the U.S. could block all USD-related transactions to my country ‚Äî like cutting SWIFT access or something similar. And honestly, in this day and age, nothing feels impossible anymore. Even our Internet access to U.S. services could be shut off someday.</p> <p>If that happens, I may no longer be able to receive any payments at all ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been seriously thinking about making my game completely free. It‚Äôs not about the money anymore.</p> <p>And in case one day the worst does happen and I can no longer speak to you here. Please take care of yourselves. Keep walking your own path.
