            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As I&#39;m learning Rust, I&#39;ve found the way modules and code structure work to be a bit strange. In many tutorials, it&#39;s often described as being similar to a file system, but I&#39;m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that a module isn&#39;t defined where its code is located.</p> <p>I understand the reasoning behind Rust&#39;s module system, with the goal of promoting modularity and encapsulation. But in practice, I find it challenging to organize my code in a way that feels natural and intuitive to me.</p> <p>For example, when I want to create a new module, I often end up spending time thinking about where exactly I should define it, rather than focusing on the implementation. It just doesn&#39;t seem to align with how I naturally think about structuring my code.</p> <p>Is anyone else in the Rust community experiencing similar struggles with the module system? I&#39;d be really interested to hear your thoughts and any tips you might have for getting more comfortable with this aspect of the language.</p> <p>Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated as I continue my journey of learning Rust.

A new reverse proxy built on top of Cloudflare&#39;s Pingora.</p> <p>Beside all cool features below I have added a new one. Now it can dynamically bulk load SSL certificates from disk and apply per domain, without any configuration. All you need is to set up a path fro certificates . </p> <p>It&#39;s full async, high performance, modern reverse proxy with some service mesh functionality with automatic <strong>HTTP2, gRPS,</strong> and <strong>WebSocket</strong> detection and proxy support.</p> <p>It have built in <strong>JWT</strong> authentication support with token server, Prometheus exporter and many more fancy features.</p> <p>100% on Rust, Built on top of <strong>Cloudflare&#39;s</strong> fantastic library: <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora"><strong>Pingora</strong></a> . My recent tests shows it can do <strong>130k</strong> requests per second on moderate hardware.</p> <p>Prebuilt <strong>glibc</strong> and <strong>musl</strong> libraries for <strong>x86_64</strong> and <strong>aarch64</strong> from are available in <a href="https://github.com/sadoyan/gazan/releases">releases</a> .</p> <p>If you like this project, please consider giving it a star on <a href="https://github.com/sadoyan/aralez"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>!

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys In nodejs talking about RDBS communication in my vision definitely <code>knex</code> is the lib comes first into my mind as a solution.</p> <p>Personally I discovered <code>knex</code> for myself relatively not that long ago. Still currently I can&#39;t even imaging how to solve the same tasks without it (and truly speaking I hardly can remember how I did it before)</p> <p>Just to summarize * it solve whatever problem including SQL, DML, DDL maintenance, migrations * any solution goes out of the box with zero extra code * operates on a pure SQL DSL bound to a native js language * as a bonus it is db implementation agnostic</p> <p>Trying to chose a similar solution for pg on golang it looks (from the first glance) like all the options covers only subset of the <code>knex</code> functionality or doing it in some partial way</p> <p>E.g. <a href="https://github.com/go-pg/pg">go-pg/pg</a> from the very first glance looks the most similar candidate. Still it looks to operate more on ORM level and focused on a model specific issues instead of query builder. And from examples as <code> _, err := db.Model(book). OnConflict(&quot;(id) DO UPDATE&quot;). Set(&quot;title = EXCLUDED.title&quot;). Insert() </code> it looks it doesn&#39;t cover DSL that well. To compare <code>knex</code> solution <code> .onConflict(&#39;email&#39;) .merge([&#39;email&#39;, &#39;name&#39;, &#39;updated_at&#39;]); ... .onConflict(&#39;email&#39;) .ignore(); ... .onConflict(&#39;email&#39;) .merge({ name: &#39;John Doe The Second&#39;, }); </code></p> <p>So the difference is not that critical. But taking into account the <code>go-pg/pg</code> is more focused on ORM issues and the wide range of tasks covered by <code>knex</code> there&#39;s some anxiety that some cases (that currently just didn&#39;t come to a mind) would be just unachievable or ones that hard to implement with it.</p> <p>So the question is to those who worked in practice with both <code>knex</code> and any golang implementations in pg scope which the golang implementation provides the most relevant experience comparing to one the <code>knex</code> does.</p> <p>And being that wondered for absence of pure <code>knex</code> analogues in golang I had even thoughts on how much would it take to implement it from scratch even starting from some MVP in the scope of minimal requirements of current needs. So the second question is what is the reason for such a gap in golang. Maybe is there something in technical differences between golang and js (as typing system etc) making such implementation non achievable or not suitable for use. E.g. is it the very same story as for js array iterators (map, filter, reduce). Still conceptually <code>go-pg/pg</code> shows the very similar idea making me doubt on that assumption.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Typical_Potato782"> /u/Typical_Potato782 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lf8t29/what_are_the_best_analog_for_knexjs_for_golang/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1lf8t29/what_are_the_best_analog_for_knexjs_for_golang/">[comments]</a></span></div>
