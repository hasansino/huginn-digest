    <h1>[ On | No ] syntactic support for error handling</h1>

      <div class='markdown'>
<p>One of the oldest and most persistent complaints about Go concerns the verbosity of error handling.
We are all intimately (some may say painfully) familiar with this code pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">x, err := call()
if err != nil {
        // handle err
}
</code></pre>
<p>The test <code>if err != nil</code> can be so pervasive that it drowns out the rest of the code.
This typically happens in programs that do a lot of API calls, and where handling errors
is rudimentary and they are simply returned.
Some programs end up with code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    y, err := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x + y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of the ten lines of code in this function body, only four (the calls and the last two lines) appear to do real work.
The remaining six lines come across as noise.
The verbosity is real, and so it&rsquo;s no wonder that complaints about error handling have topped
our annual user surveys for years.
(For a while, the lack of generics surpassed complaints about error handling, but now that
Go supports generics, error handling is back on top.)</p>
<p>The Go team takes community feedback seriously, and so for many years now we have tried to
come up with a solution for this problem, together with input from the Go community.</p>
<p>The first explicit attempt by the Go team dates back to 2018, when Russ Cox
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-handling-overview.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">formally described the problem</a>
as part of what we called the Go 2 effort at that time.
He outlined a possible solution based on a
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-error-handling.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">draft design</a>
by Marcel van Lohuizen.
The design was based on a <code>check</code> and <code>handle</code> mechanism and was fairly comprehensive.
The draft includes a detailed analysis of alternative solutions, including comparisons with
approaches taken by other languages.
If you&rsquo;re wondering if your particular error handling idea was previously considered,
read this document!</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">// printSum implementation using the proposed check/handle mechanism.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    handle err { return err }
    x := check strconv.Atoi(a)
    y := check strconv.Atoi(b)
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x + y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>check</code> and <code>handle</code> approach was deemed too complicated and almost a year later, in 2019,
we followed up with the much simplified and by now
<a href="/issue/32437#issuecomment-2278932700">infamous</a>
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/32437-try-builtin.md" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>try</code> proposal</a>.
It was based on the ideas of <code>check</code> and <code>handle</code>, but the <code>check</code> pseudo-keyword became
the <code>try</code> built-in function and the <code>handle</code> part was omitted.
To explore the impact of the <code>try</code> built-in, we wrote a simple tool
(<a href="https://github.com/griesemer/tryhard" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">tryhard</a>)
that rewrites existing error handling code using <code>try</code>.
The proposal was argued over intensively, approaching 900 comments on the <a href="/issue/32437">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">// printSum implementation using the proposed try mechanism.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    // use a defer statement to augment errors before returning
    x := try(strconv.Atoi(a))
    y := try(strconv.Atoi(b))
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x + y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>try</code> affected control flow by returning from the enclosing function in case of an error,
and did so from potentially deeply nested expressions, thus hiding this control flow from view.
This made the proposal unpalatable to many, and despite significant investment
into this proposal we decided to abandon this effort too.
In retrospect it might have been better to introduce a new keyword,
something that we could do now since we have fine-grained control over the language version
via <code>go.mod</code> files and file-specific directives.
Restricting the use of <code>try</code> to assignments and statements might have alleviated some
of the other concerns. A <a href="/issue/73376">recent proposal</a> by Jimmy Frasche, which essentially
goes back to the original <code>check</code> and <code>handle</code> design and addresses some of that design&rsquo;s
shortcomings, pursues that direction.</p>
<p>The repercussions of the <code>try</code> proposal led to much soul searching including a series of blog
posts by Russ Cox: <a href="https://research.swtch.com/proposals-intro" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;Thinking about the Go Proposal Process&rdquo;</a>.
One conclusion was that we likely diminished our chances for a better outcome by presenting an almost
fully baked proposal with little space for community feedback and a &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; implementation
timeline. Per <a href="https://research.swtch.com/proposals-large" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;Go Proposal Process: Large Changes&rdquo;</a>:
&ldquo;in retrospect, <code>try</code> was a large enough change that the new design we published [&hellip;] should have
been a second draft design, not a proposal with an implementation timeline&rdquo;.
But irrespective of a possible process and communication failure in this case, the user sentiment towards
the proposal was very strongly not in favor.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a better solution at that time and didn&rsquo;t pursue syntax changes for error handling for several years.
Plenty of people in the community were inspired, though, and we received a steady trickle
of error handling proposals, many very similar to each other, some interesting, some incomprehensible,
and some infeasible.
To keep track of the expanding landscape, another year later, Ian Lance Taylor created an
<a href="/issue/40432">umbrella issue</a>
which summarizes the current state of proposed changes for improved error handling.
A <a href="/wiki/Go2ErrorHandlingFeedback">Go Wiki</a> was created to collect related feedback, discussions, and articles.
Independently, other people have started tracking all the many error handling proposals
over the years.
It&rsquo;s amazing to see the sheer volume of them all, for instance in Sean K. H. Liao&rsquo;s blog post on
<a href="https://seankhliao.com/blog/12020-11-23-go-error-handling-proposals/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">&ldquo;go error handling proposals&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>The complaints about the verbosity of error handling persisted
(see <a href="/blog/survey2024-h1-results">Go Developer Survey 2024 H1 Results</a>),
and so, after a series of increasingly refined Go team internal proposals, Ian Lance Taylor published
<a href="/issue/71203">&ldquo;reduce error handling boilerplate using <code>?</code>&rdquo;</a> in 2024.
This time the idea was to borrow from a construct implemented in
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Rust</a>, specifically the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html#the-question-mark-operator-" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>?</code> operator</a>.
The hope was that by leaning on an existing mechanism using an established notation, and taking into
account what we had learned over the years, we should be able to finally make some progress.
In small informal user studies where programmers were shown Go code using <code>?</code>, the vast majority
of participants correctly guessed the meaning of the code, which further convinced us to give it another
shot.
To be able to see the impact of the change, Ian wrote a tool that converts ordinary Go code
into code that uses the proposed new syntax, and we also prototyped the feature in the
compiler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">// printSum implementation using the proposed &quot;?&quot; statements.
func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x := strconv.Atoi(a) ?
    y := strconv.Atoi(b) ?
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x + y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, as with the other error handling ideas, this new proposal was also quickly overrun
with comments and many suggestions for minor tweaks, often based on individual preferences.
Ian closed the proposal and moved the content into a <a href="/issue/71460">discussion</a>
to facilitate the conversation and to collect further feedback.
A slightly modified version was received
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/71460#discussioncomment-12060294" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">a bit more positively</a>
but broad support remained elusive.</p>
<p>After so many years of trying, with three full-fledged proposals by the Go team and
literally <a href="/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+label%3Aerror-handling">hundreds</a> (!)
of community proposals, most of them variations on a theme,
all of which failed to attract sufficient (let alone overwhelming) support,
the question we now face is: how to proceed? Should we proceed at all?</p>
<p><em>We think not.</em></p>
<p>To be more precise, we should stop trying to solve the <em>syntactic problem</em>, at least for the foreseeable
future.
The <a href="https://github.com/golang/proposal?tab=readme-ov-file#consensus-and-disagreement" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal process</a>
provides justification for this decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the proposal process is to reach general consensus about the outcome in a timely manner.
If proposal review cannot identify a general consensus in the discussion of the issue on the issue tracker,
the usual result is that the proposal is declined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It can happen that proposal review may not identify a general consensus and yet it is clear that the
proposal should not be outright declined.
[&hellip;]
If the proposal review group cannot identify a consensus nor a next step for the proposal,
the decision about the path forward passes to the Go architects [&hellip;], who review the discussion and
aim to reach a consensus among themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of the error handling proposals reached anything close to a consensus,
so they were all declined.
Even the most senior members of the Go team at Google do not unanimously agree
on the best path forward <em>at this time</em> (perhaps that will change at some point).
But without a strong consensus we cannot reasonably move forward.</p>
<p>There are valid arguments in favor of the status quo:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If Go had introduced specific syntactic sugar for error handling early on, few would argue over it today.
But we are 15 years down the road, the opportunity has passed, and Go has
a perfectly fine way to handle errors, even if it may seem verbose at times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking from a different angle, let&rsquo;s assume we came across the perfect solution today.
Incorporating it into the language would simply lead from one unhappy group of users
(the one that roots for the change) to another (the one that prefers the status quo).
We were in a similar situation when we decided to add generics to the language, albeit with an
important difference:
today nobody is forced to use generics, and good generic libraries are written such that users
can mostly ignore the fact that they are generic, thanks to type inference.
On the contrary, if a new syntactic construct for error handling gets added to the language,
virtually everybody will need to start using it, lest their code become unidiomatic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not adding extra syntax is in line with one of Go&rsquo;s design rules:
do not provide multiple ways of doing the same thing.
There are exceptions to this rule in areas with high &ldquo;foot traffic&rdquo;: assignments come to mind.
Ironically, the ability to <em>redeclare</em> a variable in
<a href="/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations">short variable declarations</a> (<code>:=</code>) was introduced to address a problem
that arose because of error handling:
without redeclarations, sequences of error checks require a differently named <code>err</code> variable for
each check (or additional separate variable declarations).
At that time, a better solution might have been to provide more syntactic support for error handling.
Then, the redeclaration rule may not have been needed, and with it gone, so would be various
associated <a href="/issue/377">complications</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to actual error handling code, verbosity fades into the background if errors are
actually <em>handled</em>.
Good error handling often requires additional information added to an error.
For instance, a recurring comment in user surveys is about the lack of stack traces associated
with an error.
This could be addressed with support functions that produce and return an augmented
error.
In this (admittedly contrived) example, the relative amount of boilerplate is much smaller:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf(&quot;invalid integer: %q&quot;, a)
    }
    y, err := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf(&quot;invalid integer: %q&quot;, b)
    }
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x + y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>New standard library functionality can help reduce error handling boilerplate as well,
very much in the vein of Rob Pike&rsquo;s 2015 blog post
<a href="/blog/errors-are-values">&ldquo;Errors are values&rdquo;</a>.
For instance, in some cases <a href="/pkg/cmp#Or"><code>cmp.Or</code></a> may be used to deal with a
series of errors all at once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Go">func printSum(a, b string) error {
    x, err1 := strconv.Atoi(a)
    y, err2 := strconv.Atoi(b)
    if err := cmp.Or(err1, err2); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    fmt.Println(&quot;result:&quot;, x+y)
    return nil
}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing, reading, and debugging code are all quite different activities.
Writing repeated error checks can be tedious, but today&rsquo;s IDEs provide powerful, even LLM-assisted
code completion.
Writing basic error checks is straightforward for these tools.
The verbosity is most obvious when reading code, but tools might help here as well;
for instance an IDE with a Go language setting could provide a toggle switch to hide error handling
code.
Such switches already exist for other code sections such as function bodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When debugging error handling code, being able to quickly add a <code>println</code> or
have a dedicated line or source location for setting a breakpoint in a debugger is helpful.
This is easy when there is already a dedicated <code>if</code> statement.
But if all the error handling logic is hidden behind a <code>check</code>, <code>try</code>, or <code>?</code>, the code may have to
be changed into an ordinary <code>if</code> statement first, which complicates debugging
and may even introduce subtle bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also practical considerations:
Coming up with a new syntax idea for error handling is cheap;
hence the proliferation of a multitude of proposals from the community.
Coming up with a good solution that holds up to scrutiny: not so much.
It takes a concerted effort to properly design a language change and to actually implement it.
The real cost still comes afterwards:
all the code that needs to be changed, the documentation that needs to be updated,
the tools that need to be adjusted.
Taken all into account, language changes are very expensive, the Go team is relatively small,
and there are a lot of other priorities to address.
(These latter points may change: priorities can shift, team sizes can go up or down.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a final note, some of us recently had the opportunity to attend
<a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/25" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Cloud Next 2025</a>,
where the Go team had a booth and where we also hosted a small Go Meetup.
Every single Go user we had a chance to ask was adamant that we should not change the
language for better error handling.
Many mentioned that the lack of specific error handling support in Go is most apparent
when coming freshly from another language that has that support.
As one becomes more fluent and writes more idiomatic Go code, the issue becomes much less important.
This is of course not a sufficiently large set of people to be representative,
but it may be a different set of people than we see on GitHub, and their feedback serves as yet another data point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are also valid arguments in favor of change:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of better error handling support remains the top complaint in our user surveys.
If the Go team really does take user feedback seriously, we ought to do something about this eventually.
(Although there does not seem to be
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/71460#discussioncomment-11977299" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">overwhelming support</a>
for a language change either.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the singular focus on reducing the character count is misguided.
A better approach might be to make default error handling highly visible with a keyword
while still removing boilerplate (<code>err != nil</code>).
Such an approach might make it easier for a reader (a code reviewer!) to see that an error
is handled, without &ldquo;looking twice&rdquo;, resulting in improved code quality and safety.
This would bring us back to the beginnings of <code>check</code> and <code>handle</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really know how much the issue is the straightforward syntactic verbosity of
error checking, versus the verbosity of good error handling:
constructing errors that are a useful part of an API and meaningful to developers and
end-users alike.
This is something we&rsquo;d like to study in greater depth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, no attempt to address error handling so far has gained sufficient traction.
If we are honestly taking stock of where we are, we can only admit that we
neither have a shared understanding of the problem,
nor do we all agree that there is a problem in the first place.
With this in mind, we are making the following pragmatic decision:</p>
<p><em>For the foreseeable future, the Go team will stop pursuing syntactic language changes
for error handling.
We will also close all open and incoming proposals that concern themselves primarily
with the syntax of error handling, without further investigation.</em></p>
<p>The community has put tremendous effort into exploring, discussing, and debating these issues.
While this may not have resulted in any changes to error handling syntax, these efforts have
resulted in many other improvements to the Go language and our processes.
Maybe, at some point in the future, a clearer picture will emerge on error handling.
Until then, we look forward to focusing this incredible passion on new opportunities
to make Go better for everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

This trie is used as an allowlist for requests, with any paths not found treated as 404&#39;s. With this approach, it protects against accidental exposure of version control directories, and completely eliminates path traversal attacks.</p> <p>Spars uses the <code>smol</code> async runtime for io and <code>httparse</code> for request parsing, with optional integration with <code>mime_guess</code> for comprehensive file extension / mime type mapping.</p> <p>Part of my learning process for spars was learning best practices for publishing Rust crates.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Go developer and I&#39;ve always had a curiosity about Rust. I&#39;ve tried to play around and start some personal project in it a few times. And it&#39;s mostly been ok. Like I tried to use <a href="http://hyper.rs">hyper.rs</a> a few times, but the boilerplate takes a lot to understand in many of the examples. I&#39;ve tried to use tokio, but the library is massive, and it gets difficult to understand which modules to important and now important. On top of that it drastically change the async functons</p> <p>I&#39;m saying all that to say Rust is very complicated. And while I do think there is a fantastic langauge under all that complexity, it prohibitively complex. I do get it that memory safety in domains like RTOS systems or in government spaces is crucial. But it feels like Rust thought leaders are trying to get the language adopted in other domains. Which I think is a bit of an issue because you&#39;re not competing with other languages where its much easier to be productive in.</p> <p>Here is my main gripe with the adoption. Lots of influencers in the Rust space just seem to overlook its complexity as if its no big deal. Or you have others who embrace it because Rust &quot;has to be complex&quot;. But I feel in the enterprise (where adoption matters most), no engineering manager is really going to adopt a language this complex.</p> <p>Now I understand languages like C# and Java can be complex as well. But Java at one time was looked at as a far simpler version of C++, and was an &quot;Easy language&quot;. It would grow in complexity as the language grew and the same with C#. And then there is also tooling to kind of easy you into the more complex parts of these languages.</p> <p>I would love to see Rust adopted more, I would. But I feel advociates aren&#39;t leaning into its domain where its an open and shut case for (mission critical systems requiring strict safety standards). And is instead also trying to compete in spaces where Go, Javascript, Java already have a strong foothold.</p> <p>Again this is not to critcize Rust. I like the language. But I feel too many people in the Rust community talk around its complexity.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GolangLinuxGuru1979"> /u/GolangLinuxGuru1979 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mx8izf/does_rust_complexity_ever_bother_you/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mx8izf/does_rust_complexity_ever_bother_you/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I learned more from finishing one tiny game than years of half-built prototypes. Prototypes are fun, but they trick you. You get the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coding!‚Äù dopamine while dodging the hard stuff that actually makes you a game dev: finishing.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the stuff that finally clicked:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Prototype skills don‚Äôt equal shipping skills.</strong> Messy code works in a small toy project, but real games need save data, menus, settings, scenes, currency‚Ä¶ that forces you to learn real architecture.</li> <li><strong>Vertical slice &gt; infinite features.</strong> Build one playable chunk to release quality. If adding content feels painful, your code‚Äôs wrong. Fix that before scaling.</li> <li><strong>Scope math is brutal.</strong> If weeks √∑ (features √ó boring tasks) &lt; 1, you‚Äôre scoped wrong. Cut features or you‚Äôll drown.</li> <li><strong>Daily proof.</strong> Don‚Äôt just ‚Äúwork on X.‚Äù End each day with something you can <em>show working</em>. Even a tiny thing.</li> <li><strong>Marketing early.</strong> Post clips, gifs, builds. Feedback keeps you honest and motivated.</li> </ul> <p>One question I ask every day: <em>‚ÄúIf I stop now, did I move this closer to release?‚Äù</em> If not, I‚Äôm just decorating scaffolding again.</p> <p>I made a short video about this with examples if you‚Äôre curious: <a href="https://youtu.be/qhKbXHDvX2Y">Youtube Link</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kevin00812"> /u/Kevin00812 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx3l28/why_finishing_one_small_game_will_skyrocket_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx3l28/why_finishing_one_small_game_will_skyrocket_your/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>People say if you want to release a game, you should grind 12 hours a day full-time, or 4 hours after your 8-hour job. Sorry, I don‚Äôt buy it. From what I‚Äôve seen, I can squeeze out maybe 4 hours of real work a day. Beyond that, it turns into busywork with no meaningful output. I honestly can‚Äôt imagine anyone maintaining true productivity for 12 hours straight. If you can - great. I can‚Äôt.</p> <p>And it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt tried. I pushed myself once, went all-in, and within a month I was completely burned out and started hating development as a concept. Never again.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs the kicker: I refuse to feel bad about it. That ‚Äúrule‚Äù is arbitrary - sounds tough, but it‚Äôs hollow. I‚Äôll stick to my pace. Sorry, not sorry.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Justaniceman"> /u/Justaniceman </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx2mq0/im_sorry_but_i_dont_like_the_grind/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx2mq0/im_sorry_but_i_dont_like_the_grind/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like many, I lost my job a few months ago during a massive round of layoffs.</p> <p>I&#39;m here to try answer any questions, provide advice, share my experiences. Whether you‚Äôre looking to find ways to grow or are feeling disheartened with the state of things right now (it sure is bleak out there, which I am experiencing first hand with the current job hunt).</p> <p>I believe there is a lot about the discipline that isn‚Äôt widely discussed, I‚Äôd like to help change that.</p> <p>I have worked in PC, Console, Mobile throughout my career. With big and small publishers, for indies, work for hire, own startup, contracts, freelance, and probably more. My game design experience covers a very broad spectrum of the discipline.</p> <p>This is a followup to a post back then offering 1-1 advice to anyone interested, but the response was overwhelming to say the least. I&#39;ve spoken to a lot of people over the last few months, but have barely scratched the surface (I am sorry to anyone I couldn&#39;t get to). So I&#39;m here doing an AMA (as many also suggested) to try get some wider coverage now.</p> <p>I have also been making the most of this time and have started working on my own game in the VR space, which so far has been an amazing experience to jump into, I&#39;ve been learning a lot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HumbleRamble"> /u/HumbleRamble </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx1b2f/advice_from_a_game_designer_of_15_years_affected/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx1b2f/advice_from_a_game_designer_of_15_years_affected/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m feeling a little bummed atm. I&#39;ve been working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2436660/Splatterbot/">Splatterbot</a> for two and a half years, and announced the September 4th release date last week. Things have been going very well. I&#39;ve had coverage from Famitsu and NintendoLife. My latest trailer is on IGN/Game Trailers. Keys are going out to press and influencers over the next few days.</p> <p>Then the Silksong announcement came. Possibly the most anticipated game in the last few years (after GTAVI) is launching the same day as Splatterbot. I&#39;m excited that Silksong has a launch date, but also shattered that it&#39;s the same day as Splatterbot. Even though they&#39;re very different games, I believe there is significant overlap in our target audience, especially on Switch.</p> <p>It&#39;s very difficult to change my release date due to the marketing that has already happened, so I&#39;m kinda stuck with launching alongside Silksong. I&#39;m trying not to get too hung up on it as it&#39;s beyond my control, but is there anything I can do to minimise the damage of the situation? Has anybody been in this situation before?</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tanka2d"> /u/tanka2d </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx036z/rip_my_game_is_launching_the_same_day_as_silksong/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1mx036z/rip_my_game_is_launching_the_same_day_as_silksong/">[comments]</a></span></div>
