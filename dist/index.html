            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I have questions regarding how to mitigate the issue related to rayon&#39;s thread pool starvation and deadlock. Currently, I&#39;m developing an incremental compilation query system, similar to what Rustc and Rust-analyzer use.</p> <p>At its core, the query is identical to a function, having input and producing deterministic output, and also can depend on/call other queries in the process. In its simplest form, my query system allows caching of the calculated query, so no query is computed twice. To give you an example, let&#39;s imagine there are three queries, A, B, and C; A depends on B, and C depends on B. Next, imagine A and C queries are executed in parallel; therefore, both queries will eventually require query B to be computed. Let&#39;s say A and C happen to require query B simultaneously from different threads; either A or C will get to compute B, and one has to wait.</p> <p>This is a rough implementation to give you a better idea:</p> <pre><code>enum State { Running(Notification), Completed(QueryResult) } pub struct QuerySystem { // if key doesn&#39;t exist, it means the query has been computed pub db: DashMap&lt;QueryInput, State&gt; } </code></pre> <p>When one of the queries is being computed, the state will change to <code>Running,</code> and when another thread tries to get the result of the query that is being computed, it has to go to sleep until it receives notification.</p> <p>I tried executing a query in parallel using <code>rayon,</code> and it seems to work fine; however, I encountered a nasty deadlock due to how the <code>rayon</code> thread pool and job stealing mechanism work. I can confirm this by swapping out rayon to native thread, and the deadlock issues are gone.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read some documentation and seen that the rayon explicitly advises avoiding having some sleeping/blocking inside their thread pool. I&#39;ve tried to do something like <code>rayon::yield_now</code> before when a thread has to go to sleep waiting for a query being computed on another thread, but it doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Some LLMs suggest I go for async so that I can <code>await</code> to yield the task when waiting for another thread to compute the query. However, I don&#39;t want to mess with the async complexities.</p> <p>Do you have any suggestions or alternative architectures that can mitigate this issue? I want my query system to be able to run in parallel fearlessly. Or should I bite the bullet and go with async tokio?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Annual_Strike_8459"> /u/Annual_Strike_8459 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m98gkq/dealing_with_threadpool_starvation_and_deadlock/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1m98gkq/dealing_with_threadpool_starvation_and_deadlock/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I just released <strong>v0.5.0</strong> of <a href="https://github.com/aguacero7/rkik"><strong>rkik</strong></a> (Rusty Klock Inspection Kit), a CLI tool to query and compare NTP servers from the terminal. Just as are Ping or NTP. It‚Äôs a simple but robust tool written entirely in Rust, and this release focuses heavily on <strong>network layer control</strong> and output <strong>clarity</strong>.</p> <p>That was a really great thing to learn how to properly query a NTP server using NTPv6, binding to an IPv6 socket, ...</p> <h1>What‚Äôs new in v0.5.0</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Explicit IPv6 support</strong>: <code>--ipv6</code> now enforces IPv6 resolution (AAAA only), socket binding to <code>::0</code>, and clean error fallback if no address is found.</li> <li><strong>IPv4 prioritized by default</strong>: Even if the DNS resolver returns AAAA first (due to cache or OS preference), <code>rkik</code> prefers A records unless <code>--ipv6</code> is set. This avoids unpredictable behavior.</li> <li><strong>Low-level querying control</strong>: Instead of querying hostnames directly, <code>rkik</code> resolves the IP manually and synchronizes using <code>SocketAddr</code>, preventing silent fallback across IP versions.</li> <li><strong>Improved logs and output</strong>: Whether in <code>--format text</code> or <code>--format json</code>, the IP version used (v4/v6) is clearly shown. This helps avoid false assumptions in dual-stack environments.</li> <li><strong>Test suite improvements</strong>: Includes unit tests for resolution behavior (IPv4 vs IPv6) and CLI output in JSON/text. Network tests are isolated and skipped during CI (e.g. via environment filter).</li> </ul> <p>For example : <span class="md-spoiler-text">rkik <a href="http://2.pool.ntp.org">2.pool.ntp.org</a> --ipv6 </span>would result with :</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/j7nj7fg2h0ff1.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a85d9e80b332193b6bc6355db00b2135c73bab">https://preview.redd.it/j7nj7fg2h0ff1.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a85d9e80b332193b6bc6355db00b2135c73bab</a></p> <p>If ever you want to try it you can just install it from the <a href="http://crates.io">crates.io</a> repository.</p> <pre><code>cargo install rkik </code></pre> <p>Or use the pre-compiled binaries or RPM/DEB Packages available at <a href="https://github.com/aguacero7/rkik/releases/tag/v0.5.0">ttps://github.com/aguacero7/rkik/releases/tag/v0.5.0</a> </p> <p><strong>Feedback / Contributions welcome</strong></p> <p>In case you&#39;re working in observability, ops, embedded, or edge environments and need low-level time sync tools, I&#39;d love to hear how you&#39;re using <code>rkik</code>.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I‚Äôm building a MES-like system and I‚Äôm unsure about how to properly structure service/repository responsibilities between two domain entities: <code>ProductionOrder</code> and <code>MachineState</code>.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôve modeled things so far:</p> <ul> <li><code>ProductionOrder</code> has its own repository and service. It handles validation, creation, status transitions (like Pending ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí Finished), and owns logic related to what it means to ‚Äústart‚Äù or ‚Äúfinish‚Äù an order.</li> <li><code>MachineState</code> has its own repository and service. It manages the state of each machine (Idle, Running, Stopped, etc.) and encapsulates logic related to transitions between these states amd production flux.</li> </ul> <p>There‚Äôs also a <code>Queue</code> table that represents which orders are assigned to each machine. A production order can be added to this queue when it&#39;s created ‚Äî that logic currently lives in <code>ProductionOrderService</code>.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs where things get tricky:</p> <ul> <li>When I start production on a machine (from <code>MachineStateService</code>), I <strong>must also update the corresponding</strong> <code>ProductionOrder</code> to set its status to <code>InProgress</code>. But in theory I would need to access the order service for it to validate if it can do this and it should do it itself in theory, right?</li> <li>Later, when production is finished, the order should also be marked as <code>Finished</code>, and <strong>removed from the queue</strong>.</li> <li>The logic to remove the order from the queue could happen either: <ol> <li>From within <code>MachineStateService</code> (since the machine ‚Äúknows‚Äù it‚Äôs done), or</li> <li>From within <code>ProductionOrderService</code> when it transitions to <code>Finished</code>, or</li> <li>From a higher-level orchestration service that coordinates both</li> </ol></li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôm currently considering this approach:</p> <ul> <li>Create an <strong>orchestrator service</strong> that starts a DB transaction</li> <li>It then creates transactional versions of both repositories</li> <li>And delegates the logic to each domain service (<code>ProductionOrderService</code>, <code>MachineStateService</code>), keeping concerns separate but consistent</li> </ul> <p>What would you recommend in this kind of setup?</p> <ul> <li>Should machine logic ever directly alter production orders?</li> <li>Is orchestration the right choice, or is that overengineering?</li> </ul> <p>What‚Äôs the best approach to structure this in a modular monolith built with Go?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Low_Expert_5650"> /u/Low_Expert_5650 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8xkc3/help_structuring_responsibilities_between/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8xkc3/help_structuring_responsibilities_between/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Greetings everyone. I faced a problem that I struggle to express clearly, overall, I got confused.</p> <p>I&#39;m coding a simple CRUD project to practice, trying to implement clean architecture, SOLID principles and so on and everything has been going well, before I came up with the idea of adding a logger to my layers.<br/> When I need to inject a dependency, I think about an interface with all methods I&#39;d use as a client. So, for logger I made a package logger and defined next code:</p> <pre><code>package logger import ( &quot;io&quot; &quot;log/slog&quot; ) type LeveledLogger interface { Debug(msg string, args ...any) Info(msg string, args ...any) Warn(msg string, args ...any) Error(msg string, args ...any) } func NewSlogLogger(w io.Writer, debug bool) *slog.Logger { opts := &amp;slog.HandlerOptions{ Level: slog. LevelInfo , } if debug { opts.Level = slog. LevelDebug } logger := slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(w, opts)) return logger } </code></pre> <p>Having this interface, I decided to use it to inject dependency, let&#39;s say, to my service layer that works with post(Article) instances:</p> <pre><code>package service import ( &quot;backend/logger&quot; &quot;backend/models&quot; &quot;backend/repository&quot; &quot;context&quot; ) type PostSimpleService struct { logger logger.LeveledLogger repository repository.PostStorage } func (ps PostSimpleService) Retrieve(ctx context.Context, postId int64) (models.Post, error) { // TODO implement me panic(&quot;implement me&quot;) } .... func (ps PostSimpleService) GetAll(ctx context.Context) ([]models.Post, error) { // TODO implement me panic(&quot;implement me&quot;) } func NewPostSimpleService(logger logger.LeveledLogger, repository repository.PostStorage) PostSimpleService { return PostSimpleService{ logger: logger, repository: repository, } } </code></pre> <p>Alright. My goal is to make this code clean and testable. But I don&#39;t really understand how to keep it clean, for instance, when I want to log something using &quot;slog&quot; and use its facilities, such as, for example:</p> <pre><code>logger.With( slog.Int(&quot;pid&quot;, os.Getpid()), slog.String(&quot;go_version&quot;, buildInfo.GoVersion), ) </code></pre> <p>The crazy ideas I first came up with is using type asserting:</p> <pre><code>func (ps PostSimpleService) GetAll(ctx context.Context) ([]models.Post, error) { if lg, ok := ps.logger.(*slog.Logger); ok { lg.Debug(slog.Int(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)) } } </code></pre> <p>and use it every time I need specify exact methods that I&#39;d like to use from slog.</p> <p>This way is obviously terrible. So, my question is, how to use certain methods of realization of a abstract logger. I hope I could explain the problem. By the way, while writing this, I understood that to set up a logger, I can do it outside this layer and pass it as a dependency, but anyway, what if I want to log something not just like a message, but like: </p> <p><code>ps.Logger.Debug(slog.Int(&quot;pid&quot;, 1))</code></p> <p>using key-value. I don&#39;t know how to manage with it. </p> <p>Thanks for your attention. If I you didn&#39;t get me well, I&#39;m happy to ask you in comments.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jadrezz-"> /u/jadrezz- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8vjp9/how_should_i_handle_dependency_injection_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1m8vjp9/how_should_i_handle_dependency_injection_working/">[comments]</a></span></div>
