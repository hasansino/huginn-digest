It succeeds because there are companion materials that dive into excentricities of the problem it solves, general call to action of why you should use it, ease of use, and the journey it took to make the thing.</p> <p>I think my next steps are to make a blog discussing my journey with style, design, and go into why the tradeoffs made were worth the effort.</p> <p>I have battle tested this repo hard as evidenced via multiple types of testing and have used it in production contexts at wide scales.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think this is a top tier concern to people when they look for a library. I kinda think they look for whether it is a project sponsored by an organization with clout in the domain or evidence that it will not go away any time soon / will be supported. What do you all think?</p> <p>If something is just not performant enough for you deadlines are you going to scale your hardware up and out these days + pray vs look for improvements beyond what the standard sdk has implemented?</p> <p>While it is a deeply subjective question, I want to know what sales points make a lib most attractive to you?</p> <p>I used this to write data analysis hooks on top of data streams so validations from various origins could be done more in-band of large etl transfers rather than after full loads of relatively unknown raw content. I have also written similar code many times over my career and got tired of it because encoding/format problems are very trivial and mind numbing to reimplement it over and over. I think this is my 4th time in 15 years. Doing detection in-band is ideal especially where the xfer is io-bound + workflow would be to stop the ingestion after a certain error or error rate and wait for a remediation restream event to start.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think a readme is the right place for stories like this. I kinda think the readme should focus on the who, why, and how and not couple it to something it does not need to be since it is a general solution.

You can use it to create small pixel-art games, editors, or prototypes quickly ‚Äî with minimal boilerplate.</p> <h1>‚ú® Features</h1> <ul> <li>Familiar API: <code>spr()</code>, <code>btn()</code>, <code>map()</code>, etc. ‚Äî just like PICO-8.</li> <li>You can use your PICO-8&#39;s assets (read more <a href="https://drpaneas.github.io/pigo8/">here</a>) using <a href="https://github.com/drpaneas/parsepico">parsepico</a> (which is also written in Go).</li> <li>But if you don&#39;t, I have a sprites/map editor built with Ebiten. They are incredibly basic, there is not even `undo` or `copy-paste`. Good thing is that they support any resolution and any palette. I would be happy to improve if you think they are useful.</li> <li>Works out-of-the-box with Go&#39;s <code>go run</code>, <code>go build</code>, and supports cross-compilation.</li> <li>Inspired by minimalism and productivity ‚Äî great for jams and prototyping.</li> <li>Plays with keyboard and controllers out of the box, has pause menu, and supports online multiplayer.</li> </ul> <p>üîó GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/drpaneas/pigo8">https://github.com/drpaneas/pigo8</a></p> <p>I‚Äôd love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or ideas!

            <div class="item-content"><table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1knzwtp/open_source_url_shortener_with_fast_random_key/">  </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve developed a modern URL shortening service in Go that goes beyond basic shortening functionality. Today, I&#39;d like to share the core algorithm for generating short keys and the overall architecture.</p> <h2>Efficient Short Key Generation Algorithm</h2> <p>The most critical challenge in building a URL shortener is creating keys that are: 1. Unique with zero collision possibility 2. Secure against sequential prediction 3. Consistent in performance regardless of database size</p> <p>My solution implements a three-step approach:</p> <h3>1. Database Auto-Increment ID</h3> <p>Each URL entry receives a unique auto-increment ID when stored in the database, guaranteeing uniqueness.</p> <h3>2. Base62 Encoding</h3> <p>The numeric ID is encoded to Base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) using the <code>github.com/jxskiss/base62</code> library, creating a compact string representation.</p> <h3>3. Random Character Mixing</h3> <p>A 2-character random string is generated, with one character added to the beginning and one to the end of the Base62 encoded string.</p> <p>Example: - Random string: &quot;ab&quot; - Base62 encoded ID: &quot;cde&quot; - Final short key: &quot;acdeb&quot;</p> <p>This approach provides: - <strong>Zero collisions:</strong> Based on database unique IDs - <strong>Enhanced security:</strong> Random characters prevent predictable sequences - <strong>Consistent O(1) performance:</strong> Generation time independent of database size</p> <h2>Key Features</h2> <p>The service offers several advanced capabilities:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Platform-Specific Deep Links</strong>: Automatically detects iOS/Android and redirects to the appropriate app deep link or fallback URL</p></li> <li><p><strong>JWT Authentication</strong>: Issues guest tokens for web UI access and enforces JWT authentication for API endpoints</p></li> <li><p><strong>Webhook Integration</strong>: Sends real-time notifications to specified URLs when shortened links are accessed</p></li> <li><p><strong>Custom OG Tags</strong>: Allows customization of Open Graph tags for rich link previews on social media</p></li> </ol> <h2>Technical Stack</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Language</strong>: Go</li> <li><strong>Web Framework</strong>: Fiber</li> <li><strong>Database</strong>: PostgreSQL with GORM</li> <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Redis</li> <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: JWT</li> <li><strong>Encoding</strong>: Base62</li> </ul> <h2>Architecture Highlights</h2> <p>The system features a layered architecture: - REST API with a lightweight Fiber framework - PostgreSQL database with automatic migrations via GORM - Redis caching layer for high-performance URL lookups - Sentry for real-time error monitoring</p> <h2>Open Source and Demo</h2> <p>This project is available under the MIT license on GitHub, with a live demo at <a href="https://f-it.kr">https://f-it.kr</a>.</p> <p>The code is well-modularized, making it easy to understand the core logic or integrate it into your projects. The short key generation algorithm is designed to be implementable in various languages.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>While URL shorteners may seem simple, achieving high performance and reliability requires careful design. The combination of database unique IDs, Base62 encoding, and random characters creates a scalable, secure solution for generating short keys.</p> <p>I hope this project helps other developers building URL shortening services.

But I still find myself being confused with this...</p> <p>So, what exactly do I mean?</p> <p>Let me describe a page&#39;s abstract structure:</p> <ul> <li>HTML <ul> <li>Head</li> <li>title</li> <li>metadata (OG, SEO, ...)</li> <li>Styles, Scripts</li> <li>Body</li> <li>Menu (active entry has <code>.active</code>)</li> <li>User icon/menu</li> <li>Announcement Banners</li> <li>Content: <ul> <li>Image</li> <li>Image rating thingy, favorite button, artist, follow button, ...</li> <li>Comments</li> </ul></li> <li>Footer</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>When the page initially loads, the menu would figure out what entry is the active one and apply the <code>.active</code> class, the User component would display the initial state (probably a guest but also perhaps logged in). Elements like the Favorite-button would have a state depending the user&#39;s previous actions and so on.</p> <p>But, let&#39;s say the user is a guest at the moment, but decides to log in. They click the signin button, a form appears (drawer, modal, ...) and after they sign in, only <em>that</em> segment, the &quot;user panel&quot; should update (although it should actually also update favorite status and whatnot - but, let&#39;s focus on just one component for this example).</p> <p>Upon the form submission, we&#39;d <code>POST /user/signin</code> and that would return just the user panel with the changed state and display.</p> <p>One way would be to explicitly return just that component - for example, rendering a Templ component - but implicitly, we&#39;d return the whole page and HTMX just updates that one segment. However, the latter may be rather computationally heavy in terms of database queries and alike - and idealy, you&#39;d want to skip that, if only one small section is needed anyway.</p> <p>Granted, in this particular case, a full page rerender would make more sense - but I just wanted to come up with a moderately &quot;big-ish&quot; example. Apologies for the holes!</p> <p>Now, granted, I grew up on PHP and jQuery - one page render, and other modifications only on the client, and every navigation was a full page load. Today, we can just swap with HTMX and friends. And, during the last year, I squeezed React into my brain (and regret it, deeply) which dictates that everything happens mostly on the client and state only lives there. And, in React, only a component that has changed is in fact re-rendered. Everything else is not touched. But if you receive a HTMX request and render the whole page only for one lousy element, it would be rather overhead-y.</p> <p>So this is why I was looking for &quot;fragments&quot;. A fragment would instruct the page renderer to skip everything <strong>except</strong> that fragment that is being needed. In this case, it would be the user display.</p> <p>I am very likely overlooking something and I bet my brain is just still dis-wired from trying to do React stuff... so, please, help me out? x)</p> <p>How do I render just a fragment instead of a full page when only said fragment is needed in a hyperscript-approach frontend?</p> <p>Thank you very much! I know I am not amazing in explaining, but I tried my best. :) Mainly I am a backend guy but I want to leverage HTMX/Templ/DataStar to do &quot;a little bit&quot; of frontend...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IngwiePhoenix"> /u/IngwiePhoenix </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1knxuf2/fragmented_renderingtemplating/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1knxuf2/fragmented_renderingtemplating/">[comments]</a></span></div>

However, I noticed that I follow the same pattern in every personal project: create a big <code>Config</code> struct holding all settings, including potentially more specialized child structs within it, that I pass down to functions. I wanted something very opinionated that ticks the following boxes:</p> <ul> <li>Something that is centered around my struct definition</li> <li>Something that only reads from environment variables. I run everything in containers and don&#39;t really need flags, config files, or support for changing values at run time</li> <li>Not having to worry about choosing names for environment variables myself</li> <li>Very low learning curve</li> <li>Very few project dependencies, which is a (good or bad) habit I picked from working at a security company</li> </ul> <p>Ideally, I wanted to just write the config struct and have everything ready. So, code generation seemed like a good idea. I skimmed a lot of packages before, but most of them are libraries -- I haven&#39;t yet seen one that takes this approach (but I also admit I didn&#39;t spend a lot of time researching, please point it you know of any). There are some packages like <a href="https://github.com/vrischmann/envconfig">this one</a> that were really close to what I wanted, but I preferred something that explicitly writes in code the env var names it looks for, and having the code that reads your config in your project is just very slightly simpler than having to read library code when debugging.</p> <p>My package is essentially a CLI tool you can use with <code>//go:generate</code> to target a struct and have the code populating the struct written for you, with optionally a <code>.env</code> file. It reads every field from an associated env vars, handling issues like missing or invalid values. I know it&#39;s not super flexible, but it ticks all boxes and thus is exactly what I needed.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear thoughts or feedback. I&#39;m also accepting contributions and am open to making it more flexible in the future. For example, one feature I&#39;m looking to add is custom parsing functions.</p> <p>Project available here: <a href="https://github.com/Ozoniuss/genconfig">https://github.com/Ozoniuss/genconfig</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OkCalligrapher5886"> /u/OkCalligrapher5886 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1knweh9/genconfig_a_different_approach_to_read_your_config/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1knweh9/genconfig_a_different_approach_to_read_your_config/">[comments]</a></span></div>

It is quite ugly because I wrote it in 5 minutes, and because it wouldn&#39;t handle certain cases (tuples). But it does work as a poc. Since the debug trait is implemented by almost all types in rust, this provides a <em>interesting</em> way of very basic introspection. However this doesn&#39;t give you much about the type information, which is unfortunate.</p> <p>I still wish we had something like comptime tho. perhaps we could have a derive introspection trait that could output type information, which would be cool.

Here&#39;s how it works:</p> <pre><code>let mut policy = Policy::allow_all()?; policy .trace(Syscall::Openat, |syscall| { println!(&quot;Intercepted syscall: {:?}&quot;, syscall); TraceAction::Continue }) .apply()?; // Attempt to open a file; your handler will run first let result = fs::File::open(&quot;test.txt&quot;); println!(&quot;File open result: {:?}&quot;, result); </code></pre> <p>This lets you observe syscalls (like Openat, which is used under the hood when opening files), collect metrics, or log syscall usage ‚Äî all before the syscall actually runs. You can also make syscalls fail gracefully by returning a custom errno instead of terminating the process:</p> <pre><code>let mut policy = Policy::allow_all()?; policy .fail_with(Syscall::Execve, 5) // Execve fails with errno 5 (EIO) .fail_with(Syscall::Ptrace, 5) .apply()?; </code></pre> <p>I would love to head your suggestions and ideas, also the way syscalls enum is generated depends on your linux system because it parses your system headers at build time and it&#39;s prone to failure in some linux systems, so i would love to hear your feedback on this.<br/> github: <a href="https://github.com/x0rw/restrict">https://github.com/x0rw/restrict</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Traditional_Ball_552"> /u/Traditional_Ball_552 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kocais/crate_update_how_to_block_or_intercept_specific/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kocais/crate_update_how_to_block_or_intercept_specific/">[comments]</a></span></div>
