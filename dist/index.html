            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there, I‚Äôm currently developing a game called Meat Grinder. It‚Äôs a story-driven simulation game where you run a hot dog shop while getting caught up in strange events happening in a small town. (You can check my profile if you‚Äôre curious.) The game is nearly finished, and I‚Äôve started thinking about my second project. But I‚Äôm facing a dilemma.</p> <p>On one hand, I could make a game in a more popular genre (which seems to have a higher chance of financial success). On the other hand, I could experiment with the kind of game I really want to make (though I know it‚Äôs a bit riskier).</p> <p>I‚Äôm an artist, and I really want to create something artistic. I‚Äôm currently focused on a neo-noir style game. If you‚Äôve seen the mini-series Ripley on Netflix, that‚Äôs exactly the kind of artistic and atmospheric direction I‚Äôm aiming for. It would be a fully story-driven game focused on detective work, crime, and psychological thriller themes. The gameplay would be lighter, but I believe I can deliver a powerful story and a strong atmosphere.</p> <p>Return of the Obra Dinn is a great example‚Äîvery different from what I‚Äôm planning, but it stands out through its originality and strong identity, not to mention a very unique core mechanic.</p> <p>Do you think a game like the one I‚Äôm describing has a much lower chance of financial success, as I suspect? There aren‚Äôt many examples out there, and the closest ones I‚Äôve seen seem to cap out around 8k‚Äì10k reviews.</p> <p>What would you do if you were in my place?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Different_Hunter33"> /u/Different_Hunter33 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdi4om/my_game_is_nearly_done_but_im_torn_chase_trends/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kdi4om/my_game_is_nearly_done_but_im_torn_chase_trends/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Basic color theory.</em></p> <p><em>2. Lighting and Glow</em></p> <p><em>3. Postprocess settings:- Saturation + Contrast- Temperature- Depth of field- Post-process materials</em></p> <p><em>4. Skyboxes:</em> To properly showcase the impact of these settings I made a scene in Unreal Engine out of the most basic shapes, our goal will be to turn this scene into something good-looking!<br/> <a href="https://imgur.com/uZ0MIFd">imgur.comimgur.com/uZ0MIFd</a></p> <p> </p> <h1>1. Let‚Äôs start with some Color Theory!</h1> <p>Honestly, I don‚Äôt have a deep knowledge of color theory but there are a few rules that I follow and apply to my games.</p> <p>First off, <strong>choose 2-3 dominant colors</strong> that fit together for your scene/game, I recommend choosing pallets of movies or other games that fit the vibe/ environment you‚Äôre trying to make. In the case of our scene, I kept it simple, Brown, green, and blue. the rest was either the color white which somehow always looks good everywhere or a variation of the main colors, like a lighter brown or a darker green.I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre not allowed to use more colors BUT you should just try to stick to them as much as you can. This will make the environment <strong>less chaotic and busy.</strong> </p> <p>Another tip I can give you here is also to choose an <strong>additional color that heavily contrasts next to your other colors</strong> to make your player naturally attracted to certain objects, for example in our scene we could have a bright red object on the floor that will automatically get our attention because it‚Äôs the only object with that color in our scene. Just keep in mind that this only works if this is the rarest color in your game.<br/> <a href="https://imgur.com/I14xsKl">imgur.comimgur.com/I14xsKl</a></p> <p> </p> <h1>2. Now the second thing we‚Äôll look at is Lighting and Glow!</h1> <ol> <li>Adjusting and <strong>adding lights in key areas</strong> can really improve your game&#39;s look, but it&#39;s not only about brightening up your scene, it&#39;s also about <strong>adding shadows and darkness</strong> in the right places. With our fake game scene here I decided I wanted to have a soft shadow on the side and added a little light inside our dark house.</li> <li>Another easy way to enhance the look of most games is by <strong>making stuff glow</strong>, it sounds stupid but shiny and glowing stuff just looks cool, I discovered this in my very first game jam, I had very little experience in game development and decided to only use the most basic shapes to make a game, and just by adding a glow to the different shapes I gave my game a very unique and appealing look, a happy discovery that even to this day I still apply to a lot of my games. When it comes to our scene here, I&#39;m not going to make anything glow because in this case, I don&#39;t think it fits. </li> </ol> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/TsFvivA">imgur.comimgur.com/TsFvivA</a></p> <h1>3. With The third step, we‚Äôre going to explore Post-Processing effects.</h1> <p>Now I know this seems a bit obvious but bear with me because most of you still completely underutilise this insane visual tool!<em>Before we jump into this, I want to point out that Mastering Post-processing stuff is an entire job in itself and I‚Äôm not going to pretend I know how to do all the fancy stuff, however, I can teach you a few very simple tweaks that I picked up and use to make my games stand out.</em></p> <ul> <li>First of all, we have <strong>Saturation and contrast.</strong> Tweaking these two settings will already change your game significantly. For example, if you‚Äôre making a game that has a lot of natural elements and vibrant colors, you should try to slightly increase the saturation and contrast, this will make all the important colors pop even more and give your game this vibrant aesthetic, it‚Äôs what I did for my survival game prototype I worked on a year ago, and I think the views I got on my video are mainly thanks to this hyper-saturated environment and thumbnail. Now I‚Äôm not saying that you should just go ahead and crank up the saturation and contrast levels of your game to the max, in some cases it might look better to do the opposite, giving your game a desaturated look might help in making your environment feel less welcoming, more depressing and hostile. Just tweak those settings slightly and make it fit your game.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/0qAqqtK">imgur.comimgur.com/0qAqqtK</a></p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/ewXhmqY">imgur.comimgur.com/ewXhmqY</a></p> <ul> <li>The second setting we are going to look at is the <strong>temperature</strong> setting, this is a simple ideal way to give your scene <strong>a warm or cold touch</strong>. This again will depend on your setting but in this case, I think the scene should have a slight warm tropical touch.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/Sjwr1it">imgur.comimgur.com/Sjwr1it</a></p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/gPO9569">imgur.comimgur.com/gPO9569</a></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Then we have <strong>Depth of field</strong>, which is one of my favorite settings, it makes things look blurry in the background but makes things close up look more crisp and focused, a perfect example of this practice is Octopath Travelers, the depth of field here really makes the game stand out and unique, let‚Äôs apply it to our scene.</li> <li>The final post-process option is slightly more complicated, And that is <strong>applying a post-processing material</strong>, this could be a toon shader, an outline shader, a mix of both, or any other cool visual-altering shader. You can find loads of tutorials online on how to create these shaders or you can also find some really good-looking shaders in various asset stores for quite cheap.</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/kLRfAE8">imgur.comimgur.com/kLRfAE8</a></p> <p><a href="https://imgur.com/ViLhApw">imgur.comimgur.com/ViLhApw</a></p> <h1>4. A Skybox!</h1> <p>The last part of this experiment is probably <strong>the most simple change you can make</strong>, using <strong>a fitting skybox!</strong> For those that don&#39;t know, a sky box is a huge inverted sphere with a texture applied to it, for our scene, I&#39;m using this free anime skybox I found on sketch fab, and that‚Äôs the last piece of our puzzle, I personally really like the way this turned out and I hope it gave you some insight into how to improve the looks of your own game!<br/> <a href="https://imgur.com/MvJDvlC">imgur.comimgur.com/MvJDvlC</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading and best of luck with your games!</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable_Winner_95"> /u/Remarkable_Winner_95 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kd1iot/4_easy_tweaks_to_make_your_game_look_good/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kd1iot/4_easy_tweaks_to_make_your_game_look_good/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There‚Äôs a mindset I‚Äôve noticed in myself and in a lot of other devs, especially the technically-minded ones. I‚Äôm calling it the ‚Äúsystems visionary trap.‚Äù</p> <p>It usually starts like this: You‚Äôre trying to solve a specific problem in your game, but instead of just solving that problem, your brain immediately jumps to designing a whole system that could handle every possible variation of that problem. You‚Äôre not thinking one step ahead. You‚Äôre thinking five, or at least trying to.</p> <p>When you‚Äôre in this mindset, it feels productive. It gives the illusion that you‚Äôre being strategic. But most of the time, you‚Äôre actually avoiding execution. You end up pouring your energy into building infrastructure before validating the idea, before confirming that the core loop works, and before shipping anything at all.</p> <p>Then, after looking at all the infrastructure you‚Äôve built, you usually burn out. Or you get bored. Or you get stuck in the complexity of your own abstractions.</p> <p>I‚Äôm not here to tell you what to do if you recognize this mindset in yourself.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,<br/> A while ago, I decided to take on the challenge of migrating the well-known p0f (passive TCP fingerprinting) tool from C to Rust. The original p0f is a classic in the network security world, but its codebase is quite old and can be tough to maintain or extend. I‚Äôve now got a Rust version (passivetcp-rs) that replicates the core functionality of p0f, and in my testing with a variety of devices, it produces very similar results in OS and stack detection. The new implementation is type-safe, easier to test, and much more maintainable.

Because QEMU does a lot of reflection-like stuff using static variables, autogenerating those with traits and associated <code>const</code>s will require Rust 1.83.0. Supporting older Rust versions for the first few months was still useful, because it provided a (somewhat artificial) test bench for integrating unit tests and procedural macros in the build.</p> <p>With respect to build system integration I&#39;m hoping to make things easier for everyone who wants to do something like this in the future.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1>Summary</h1> <p>This proposal introduces a new API for Rc that allows creating cyclic references without requiring a nested call inside Rc::new_cyclic. The new API separates the creation of the weak reference and the initialization of the strong reference into distinct steps, making it easier to set up a collection of weak pointers before initializing a set of strong pointers.</p> <h1>Motivation</h1> <p>The current Rc::new_cyclic API in Rust requires a nested closure to initialize cyclic references. For example:</p> <pre><code>let rc = Rc::new_cyclic(|weak| { T::new(weak.clone()) }); </code></pre> <p>This pattern can become difficult to read and maintain in cases with complex initialization logic or when dealing with multiple types each requiring weak pointers. The nested closure also makes it harder to reason about control flow and introduces an additional layer of indirection.</p> <pre><code>let a = Rc::new_cyclic(|weak_a| { let b = Rc::new_cyclic(|weak_b| { // B references A weakly. B::new(weak.clone()) }); // A references B strongly. A::new(b) }); </code></pre> <p>Further types <code>C..Z</code> will each need to be created in a nested fashion, making it difficult to generate a list of all items <code>A..Z</code>.</p> <h1>Proposed addition</h1> <p>The new API introduces a method called <code>Rc::new_cyclic2</code> (name to be determined), which returns an initializer containing an owned <code>Weak</code>. The Rc must then be explicitly initialized using the <code>init</code> method returning an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p> <h1>Example</h1> <p>Here is an example of the new API:</p> <pre><code>let initializer: RcInitializer = Rc::new_cyclic2::&lt;T&gt;(); // Get the weak pointer let weak = initializer.weak().clone(); // Do something with `weak`... // Initialize the weak, making it upgradable. let result: Rc&lt;T&gt; = initializer.init(T::new()); </code></pre> <p>This approach separates the creation of the cyclic reference into two distinct steps:</p> <ol> <li>Creation of the initializer that holds <code>Weak</code>.</li> <li>Explicit initialization of the Rc using the <code>init</code> method.</li> </ol> <p>This allows us to do the following:</p> <pre><code> let init_a = Rc::new_cyclic2::&lt;A&gt;(); let init_b = Rc::new_cyclic2::&lt;B&gt;(); // ... let a = init_a.init(A::new(init_b.weak().clone(), init_g.weak().clone(), /* ... */)); let b = init_b.init(B::new(a.clone(), init_q.weak().clone(), init_d.weak().clone(), /* ... */)); // ... </code></pre> <p>Without having to nest closures to <code>Rc::new_cyclic</code>.</p> <h1>Drop Handling</h1> <p>If an `RcInitializer` is dropped without calling <code>init</code>, then the Weak it contains is dropped, deallocating the backing memory.</p> <h1>Implementation Details</h1> <p>Function <code>RcInitializer::init</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code> preventing multiple calls. It sets the uninit memory and returns an <code>Rc</code>. Since no strong reference exists before <code>init</code>, setting the uninit memory is guaranteed to not overwrite currently borrowed data which would cause UB. A possible high-level implementation of this API might look like the following:</p> <pre><code>impl&lt;T&gt; Rc&lt;T&gt; { pub fn new_cyclic2() -&gt; RcInitializer&lt;T&gt; { // Creates a Weak&lt;T&gt; that allocates uninit memory for T. // The pointer the Weak holds must be nonnull, and properly aligned for T. RcInitializer { inner: Weak::new_allocated(), // New function that allocates MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;. } } } pub struct RcInitializer&lt;T&gt; { inner: Weak&lt;T&gt;, } impl&lt;T&gt; RcInitializer&lt;T&gt; { pub fn init(self, value: T) -&gt; Rc&lt;T&gt; { unsafe { // New unsafe functions on weak, need not be public. self.inner.init(value); self.inner.set_strong(1); self.inner.upgrade_unchecked() } } pub fn weak(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Weak&lt;T&gt; { &amp;self.inner } } </code></pre> <h1>Drawbacks</h1> <p>Introducing a new API increases the surface area of Rc, which could add complexity for library maintainers.</p> <h1>Future Possibilities</h1> <p>This API could serve as a template for similar improvements to other cyclic reference types in the Rust ecosystem, such as <code>Arc</code>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate-Egg7566"> /u/Affectionate-Egg7566 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kczf2o/prerfc_nonnested_cyclic_initialization_of_rc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1kczf2o/prerfc_nonnested_cyclic_initialization_of_rc/">[comments]</a></span></div>

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey folks üëã</p> <p>I‚Äôve been working on a project called <strong>Yoke</strong>, which lets you manage Kubernetes resources using real, type-safe Go code instead of YAML. In this <a href="https://yokecd.github.io/blog/posts/dynamic-airways/">blog post</a>, I explore a new feature in Yoke‚Äôs <strong>Air Traffic Controller</strong> called <strong>dynamic-mode airways</strong>.</p> <p>To highlight what it can do, I tackle an age-old Kubernetes question:<br/> <strong>How do you restart a deployment when a secret changes?</strong></p> <p>It‚Äôs a problem many newcomers run into, and I thought it was a great way to show how dynamic airways bring reactive behavior to custom resources‚Äîwithout writing your own controller.</p> <p>The post is conversational, not too formal, and aimed at sharing ideas and gathering feedback. Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/davidmdm"> /u/davidmdm </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://yokecd.github.io/blog/posts/dynamic-airways/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1kd16wo/dynamic_airways_redefining_kubernetes_application/">[comments]</a></span></div>

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:</p> <h1>üåç What‚Äôs New?</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Minimap Overhaul:</strong> Each hex is colored by biome or faction, making it (much?) easier to read at a glance. <ul> <li>And no, Im not that proficient in Blender. But Rome was not build in a day! So all you get in terms of images today is the minimap projections.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>World Generation Improvements:</strong> <ul> <li>Deeper tectonic simulations, including all of these interaction types: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plate_interactions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plate_interactions</a></li> <li>Better biome transitions and more natural coastlines.</li> <li>Improved river and lake placement.</li> <li>More robust climate simulation, including precipitation and erosion.</li> <li>Faction placement logic is now more balanced and (almost) visually clear on the minimap.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Codebase Refactoring:</strong> <ul> <li>Modularized world generation.</li> <li>Easier to tweak parameters for map size, climate, and plate tectonics in the &quot;new game menu&quot;.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h1>üïπÔ∏è Main Mechanics &amp; Inspirations</h1> <p>At its core, the game is a 4X strategy (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate), but with a twist:<br/> I want it to be a pick-and-mix of my favorite mechanics from games like Civilization, Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Victoria, and Total War.</p> <ul> <li>Explore: Uncover a procedurally generated world shaped by geology and climate.</li> <li>Expand: Settle, claim, and develop new lands, adapting to different biomes and climates.</li> <li>Exploit: Manage resources, trade, and magical elements unique to your faction and environment.</li> <li>Exterminate: Engage in diplomacy, war, and intrigue‚Äîeach faction‚Äôs strengths and magic shape their approach.</li> </ul> <p>The goal is to blend deep simulation, replayable worldgen, and creative faction variety for emergent stories and strategy. And yes, I do enjoy map-painting games (disguised spreadsheets).</p> <h1>üå± Factions: Sentient Plant Civilizations</h1> <p>Factions in my game are high-fantasy, sentient plant societies. Each faction is defined by several key dimensions:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Preferred Biome:</strong> Each faction thrives best in a specific biome, inspired by real-world climate bands. Biomes include Arctic, Boreal, Grassland, Forest, Marshland, Desert, Savanna, and Rainforest. These are mapped along axes like wet‚Äìdry and cold‚Äìhot, similar to how Stellaris handles habitability.</li> <li><strong>Species Group:</strong> Factions are built around creative plant species such as Treefolk, Shroomfolk, Flowerfolk, Succulents, Fruitfolk, and Grassfolk. Each species brings unique traits and cultural flavor‚Äîthink along the lines of Warhammer‚Äôs diverse races.</li> <li><strong>Primary &amp; Secondary Focus:</strong> These determine a faction‚Äôs strengths and playstyle, with combinations like Martial, Mystical, Industrial, Scientific, Commercial, and Agricultural. This system is inspired by the flexible approaches in Civ, Humankind, and Stellaris.</li> <li><strong>Magical Element:</strong> Every faction is attuned to a magical element‚ÄîWater, Fire, Earth, or Air‚Äîwhich shapes their abilities and environmental interactions (think Avatar: The Last Airbender).</li> <li><strong>Background:</strong> Each faction has a unique lore blurb and emblem, further distinguishing their identity.</li> </ul> <h1>üöß What‚Äôs Next?</h1> <p><strong>1. Async World Generation &amp; Loading Screen</strong></p> <p>One thing I‚Äôm struggling with is making world generation asynchronous, so I can display a loading screen with a progress bar while the world is being built.<br/> Right now, everything runs on the main thread, so the game just freezes until the map is ready.</p> <ul> <li>Has anyone implemented async tasks in Bevy?</li> <li>How do you track and report progress from a background task to the UI?</li> <li>Any tips or patterns for integrating this with Bevy‚Äôs ECS and resource system?</li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Circumnavigable world</strong></p> <p>Modify the world generation so that right and left sides match up, so that we may go round and round and round and round.</p> <p><strong>3. 3d models version 2</strong></p> <p>I&#39;m also gonna put some work into the 3d models, and get a better hang of blender. So next time, maybe I can show some models! Version 1 of my 3d models are horendus..</p> <h1>üí¨ Feedback &amp; Questions</h1> <ul> <li>Any suggestions for further improving the realism of archipelagos, volcanic hotspots, or biome transitions?</li> <li>Tips for async loading and progress tracking in Bevy?</li> <li>I‚Äôd love to hear your ideas for interesting factions! What kinds of civilizations, cultures, or species would you like to see in a world shaped by geology and climate? Please drop your suggestions in the comments below!</li> <li>General feedback is also welcome!</li> </ul> <p>Thanks for reading! Looking forward to your thoughts and advice. </p> <p>üñºÔ∏è Images:<br/> 1. Map Size: 6 (224x112), Major Plates: 7, Minor Plates: 9, 24 factions<br/> 2.
