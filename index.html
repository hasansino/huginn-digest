This isn&#39;t it, but it is a recreation of it in Go. I&#39;m primarily a Kotlin\Spring developer, but I&#39;ve been doing that for 4 years straight so I wanted to try something new. I&#39;ve always been attracted to Go because of it&#39;s simplicity and the power of it&#39;s standard library.</p> <p>So, why might we want a simpler feature toggle system?</p> <p>Tools like Launchdarkly and Unleash come quite a few features and are a bit heavy. Often times when users see feature, they feel like they have to use them. Feature toggles as a concept are dead simple: if enabled, run code, else don&#39;t run that code/do something else. The implementation, in my humble opinion, should be just as simple.</p> <p>Would love some feedback! This is still a work in progress, but it&#39;s fully functional for Go projects. Other languages will be supported soon!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyMcBeast"> /u/LuckyMcBeast </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/LuckyMcBeast/stoglr">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ju0jtt/introducing_stoglr_the_simple_feature_toggler/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table></div>

So this is my 2 cents as someone who has been in multiple AAA interviews for candidates that range from juniors to Directors. </p> <p>Motivation always dies out after the first couple months in this industry. It&#39;s fun, flashy, cool, etc. at first but then it&#39;s a burden and &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;over scoped&quot; when you are really neck deep in the shits. I really think it&#39;s killing folks chances at 1. Launching something and 2. Getting their foot into the industry. Trying to build something with complex systems, crazy graphics and genre defining gameplay is only going to make you depressed in a few short months.</p> <p>Now you feel like you wasted months and getting imposter syndrome from folks talking about stuff on Linkedin.</p> <p>Instead, take your time and build something small and launch it. Something that can be beat in a hour, maybe 2. Get feedback or simply just look at what you made and grow off that. 9/10 you know exactly where the pain points are. Reiterate on the design again, and again, and again until you are ACTIVELY learning from it. Finish something small, work on a beautiful corner. You can learn so much by simply just finishing. That&#39;s the key. You can have the most incredibly worded resume but that portfolio is and will forever be king. I need to know I can trust you when shit is HOT in the kitchen to get the work done. We are all under the gun, as you can see looking at the window at the industry.</p> <p>Of course there are the special game dev god chosen ones who we all know about but you should go into this industry thinking it &quot;could&quot; happen to you. Not that it &quot;will&quot;. Start small, learn, create, fail and do it again. You got this.

            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jtzakh/i_ported_my_game_to_xbox_and_released_it_about/" target="_blank">I ported my game to Xbox and released it about two weeks ago. Without breaking any NDA, here's how it went</a>
            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Three years after releasing my game on Steam, I decided to make a sequel. But knowing how slow I am with churning out games (it&#39;s been 10 years since I started making this game!), I have to secure another source of income. That&#39;s when I decided to take a leap of faith and port the game to Xbox.</p> <p><strong>1. How long did it take?</strong></p> <p>From the moment I submitted my game pitch to ID@Xbox (<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/id">https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/id</a>), till the moment of official release, date-to-date exactly one year. Not by design; purely by chance.</p> <p><strong>2. How did I get accepted by ID@Xbox?</strong></p> <p>Prior to signing up, I already implemented extensive gamepad support for my game. It needed a lot more work to be comfortable, but fully functional. With 700+ reviews at 86% on Steam I could prove to them that there&#39;s some popularity, and I also provided a build for Xbox team to play as part of the submission.</p> <p><strong>3. How was the porting process?</strong></p> <p>I was in somewhat a &quot;uncharted territory&quot; and had a pretty rough time understanding how to get started and how to implement all the required features. Due to NDA, you will see zero reliable &quot;tutorial&quot; online anywhere. Therefore I relied heavily on Microsoft and Unity support, who were very patiently providing me with guidance and samples. I know as small devs we tend to research everything online and try to solve the problems ourselves, but you won&#39;t find anything useful; Talking directly to Microsoft and Unity support is the way to go.</p> <p>Aside from coding, optimization was also a huge undertaking, because I was dead set on releasing the game on both newer and older platforms. At first I thought the game ran like crap because I had too many polygons/lights/shadow/Gfx, but after doing extensive profiling it turned out that the bottleneck was my inefficient code. After a couple of months of refactoring, I was able to achieve 40 FPS on medium quality on Xbox One.</p> <p>Memory usage was also another big challenge on older platforms. Unlike PC which has RAM + VRAM, Xbox uses the same memory pool for both rendering and execution. Once the allocation goes beyond the available RAM, the game just crashes. So I had to do memory profiling and cut out a lot of fluff - mostly audio files, which take up a ton of memory even when they are pretty small on the disk.</p> <p>There had been numerous times when I got so stuck and intimidated that I just wanted to quit. I&#39;m glad I followed through.</p> <p><strong>4. What about certification?</strong></p> <p>Under NDA I can&#39;t say much here; but it&#39;s really not as bad as it seems when you first start tackling it. Microsoft support team is very serious about ensuring the success of your game, and they&#39;ll help you in any way they can to get you to the finish line. The certification process took me about one month to complete.</p> <p><strong>5. How was the gameplay adapted for console?</strong></p> <p>Although I already made controller support for Steam Deck, it was still quite rudimentary. The UI is very complex due to the sheer amount of functions I added over the years from player requests, and it features a Tetris-style inventory with hundreds of types of items. So I tried to make inventory management more doable by automatically switching to a &quot;snap movement&quot; when the cursor hovers over an inventory grid, which feels similar to when you use a soft keyboard with controller. Even up until the release day, I was still adding small QoL enhancements here and there.</p> <p><strong>6. How did the game sell?</strong></p> <p>I really suck at marketing. I tried sending out keys to many influencers and gaming news sites, only two ever responded. After all, a game that first came out in 2021 is no news and it won&#39;t make any money for them. But I&#39;d like to give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.thexboxhub.com/tunguska-the-visitation-complete-edition-reminds-of-the-horrors-of-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-on-xbox/">TheXboxHub</a> who did a coverage very quickly!</p> <p>So I mainly relied on Steam to market for my Xbox game... I know it sounds absurd :) I timed the Xbox release five days after a Daily Deal on Steam, which garnered millions of page visits; I then posted an announcement for the Xbox release on my Steam page before the Daily Deal started so that millions of players would see it. Also, I scheduled a Fanatical bundle to start 3 days before the Xbox release and that funneled a lot of traffic as well. I wish I could see the amount of wishlists I got for Xbox, but I haven&#39;t figured out how to check that. Since release day, the game sold 632 copies so far, but that is without a launch discount, because I forgot to schedule that xD</p> <p>After all, it was a rewarding experience and a brag-worthy chapter of my life. I think it will help support me and my family while I focus on making the sequel (bigger, longer, and uncut, hopefully); but most importantly, having my work published on console feels great :)</p> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p> <p>If you have a game on Steam that&#39;s doing well, definitely consider porting it to Xbox. The ID@Xbox team is very supportive and I believe it&#39;ll worth your time and effort.</p> <p><strong>P.S.</strong> here&#39;s the Xbox link: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tunguska-the-visitation-complete-edition/9MWG97WDMQ2V/0010">https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tunguska-the-visitation-complete-edition/9MWG97WDMQ2V/0010</a></p> <p>The review sucks right now, but I honestly don&#39;t expect much. I&#39;m not a console gamer so I really don&#39;t know what console players like vs. PC players. Also the combat controls is a learning curve even for M&amp;K players, let alone controllers. But I know that it&#39;s just how things are with a top-down shooter that is not a bullet hell, and even Foxhole suffers complaints about its aiming mechanism. I think I tried the best I can and I at least made some players happy.
