            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! I wanted to share my first published crate here.</p> <p>I have been writing Rust for a few months and one thing I found in my personal projects is that testing can sometimes be really repetitive when you need to test that an expression matches a specific pattern. If the pattern is <code>Some(1)</code>, then you can do something as simple as <code>assert_eq!(expression.unwrap(), 1);</code>, but what about cases where the pattern is more complicated, e.g. is highly nested or references an enum that doesn&#39;t have an equivalent to <code>unwrap</code>? In those cases, I kept finding myself writing things like</p> <pre><code>match $expression { $target_pattern =&gt; {} _=&gt; panic!(&quot;some panic message&quot;) } </code></pre> <p>However, this code seems too indirect to be easily readable to me, especially when it is repeated a lot. With the <code>coerce_pattern::assert_pattern</code> macro, this is as simple as <code>assert_pattern!($expression, $target_pattern)</code>.</p> <p>This alone can be done with a crate I found <a href="https://crates.io/crates/assert_matches">on crates.io</a>, namely the <code>assert_matches</code> crate. However, my crate takes this a bit further by defining a <code>coerce_pattern!</code> macro. One possible use of this is when you are in a similar case as the code-block above, but you want to perform some other testing, like checking the length of a vector. Consider</p> <pre><code>enum LegalEntity { Person { name: String }, Company { dba: String, states_of_operation: Vec&lt;String&gt; }, } let entity = LegalEntity::Company { dba: String::from(&quot;my company name&quot;), states: [&quot;NJ&quot;, &quot;NY&quot;, &quot;CT&quot;].into_iter().map(String::from).collect(), } # unit test below match entity { LegalEntity::Company { states, .. } =&gt; assert_eq!(states.len(), 3), _ =&gt; panic!(&quot;some error message&quot;), } </code></pre> <p>With <code>coerce_pattern!</code>, you can capture states out of the pattern and use it. In particular, the unit test would look like </p> <pre><code>let states = coerce_pattern!(entity, LegalEntity::Company{ states, .. }, states); assert_eq!(states.len(), 3); </code></pre> <p>or even just</p> <pre><code>assert_eq!(coerce_pattern!(entity, LegalEntity::Company{ states, .. }, states).len(), 3); </code></pre> <p>Anyway, that&#39;s the low-down on my package and it seemed generally applicable enough to publish a crate about. I welcome any feedback, but am mostly just happy to be here and happy to code in Rust, which gives me a nice reprieve from the Python of my day-job, which feels like walking a cliff-edge by comparison!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ktausch"> /u/ktausch </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://github.com/ktausch/coerce_pattern">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1juql9s/coerce_pattern_a_generalized_unwrap_for_testing/">[comments]</a></span></div>

While I&#39;ve cleaned up some long standing work and published a new release, the crate really needs some additional maintainers.</p> <p>Because it&#39;s not clear to me who exactly uses the crate actively (besides Deno, of which one maintainer already indicated they&#39;re willing to help with maintaining the crate), I&#39;m sharing this here in the hope of finding an additional one or two maintainers in order to increase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">the bus factor</a>. </p> <p>The only two requirements are some prior history/credibility when it comes to maintaining FOSS projects (as I&#39;d like to avoid an XZ situation), and some understanding of libffi itself.

            <div class="item-content"><!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This article was published to LinkedIn just 5 days after I was let go from InfinityWard In January of 2024, With no PC, I borrowed a laptop to finish up the details. I was hesitant to mention InfinityWard&#39;s involvement because it was such a big deal and something that needed to be guarded by a lawyers. To this day I am still hesitant, even though that&#39;s approaching the 25 year old mark.</p> <h1>Spearhead...</h1> <p>There&#39;s probably some really good juicy bits of story to tell in and around this time regarding the transition from EA/2015 to Activision/IW. To my peers reading these, I&#39;m telling you, someone (not it) needs to hire a book writer and maybe a good lawyer. These articles are centered around me and my simple involvement. I wouldn&#39;t want to spoil that story or otherwise say something stupid or distort the story, that was SO long ago and things are really hazy.</p> <p>I ultimately wasn&#39;t credited on this game but there are two missions that I worked on and some cool things to talk about with each of those.</p> <p>One cool thing that many don&#39;t appreciate is just How Close the new Office for this startup was, right around 4 Miles, It was actually closer to the apartment that many of us lived in.</p> <p>I think all successful game dev breakouts are likely to have similarity, one of the critical pieces of our success was Jason and Vince going to bat for us legally. Someone to put those pesky shareholders/publishers at bay, and someone to create an environment that was safe to do our thing. The creative thing, you know, game dev. This one was MESSY, 2015 had this breakout success, poised to kind of be The Studio in whatever capacity or trajectory that Tom had in mind. We were naturally working on the Expansion pack. That&#39;s what PC games did back then, a quick extension of the game that would be sold for a bit less than the original, no new features, just levels. When pretty much the whole studio left the company it was likely a no brainer to give that other studio the contract.</p> <h1>InfinityWard&#39;s &quot;Medal of Honor: Spearhead&quot;</h1> <p>InfinityWard wanted to be it&#39;s own independent studio at first. At my best recollection of those events EA was trying to stronghold a purchase of the company, When I talked to my peers about this they reminded me that it was something completely different. They wanted us to be at EA/LA, their new flagship game developer studio. As Individuals, not a company. It was probably the worst-case scenario for us because it meant a possibility of being broken up into different games and things outside of our control.</p> <p>There was much ado there and ultimately InfinityWard decided to void the contract, and become completely independent. When this happened, I volunteered to go fulfill a contractual obligation to help EA/LA get up to speed on the technology. I believe it was a 2/3 day stay, where I showed them how to use Radiant and our Technology additions to the game. The office at EALA, was way nicer than either of the offices at 2015 and Infinityward. The people there were nice too, but I knew where the magic was happening. I&#39;d rather work in a shack with my team, than be in the cushiest of offices with people I didn&#39;t know.</p> <p>I don&#39;t believe they were trying to woo me, but even though, that office was Nice.. </p> <p><strong>The Ardennes Forrest:</strong></p> <p>I kind of &quot;dissed&quot; on the MoH:AA terrain technology in the first article about MoH:AA, but it did have some strengths, and given the right context could be a real star.. Before this map I had done several &quot;test maps&quot; where I experimented heavily with the terrain tech and snow. Fog here would be the key to unlocking terrain&#39;s potential. It hid the the intersections of the road curve and grid-terrain by having drab lighting and not allowing us to see it from so far to experience the Z-fighting. It was a perfect way for me to go-back and use this technology that we worked so hard on. There was a lot of tool-engineer-time spent on this and I was happy to use it after totally discarding it in the first game.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t write any script for this map that I can recall.</p> <p><strong>T34 Tank Mission:</strong></p> <p>When I watch replays of this mission, I pretty much had all of this geometry done just like it&#39;s shown. I was pretty good at making a mess. At this time, the map grid was very constrained and didn&#39;t really lend to large scale maps, so the tanks path looked like snake-game. The edges of that snake game path looked kind of dead with nothing in them.</p> <p>I started playing with the FAKK2 skybox technology. In Fakk2 you could place a camera in a small box filled with whatever geometry you like. I put some buildings in there and ran it. It felt completely wrong as the stationary camera meant the buildings just kind of moved with you. To my delight, the camera was an entity that could be adjusted through script. I had an update loop in script that would move the camera in the box in relation to the players position in the actual game world. The scripting engine is limited to 20hz, and we did have a lerping function but even so this would result in the buildings kind of &quot;swimming&quot;. I can&#39;t tell from the videos, but if you look at some of the distant buildings you might see those buildings jiggling just a a little bit. =) I do remember putting in a request for this feature to move from script to code so that it could update per frame.</p> <p>I did write some of the script for this, and worked on some of the exploding buildings but wasn&#39;t completed.</p> <h1>A Personal Ritual</h1> <p>Through the years, I&#39;ve kept a box for each game that I&#39;ve worked on, I would treat myself to a store bought copy, even though those early games we&#39;d get a stack of them. I know, I&#39;m weird. There&#39;s just something about the whole experience of going to the store and throwing down, maybe I&#39;d get to hear something nice about the game from the sales person while being incognito. I did not buy myself a copy of this expansion pack.</p> <h1>Rebooting World-War 2</h1> <p>Part of the appeal for going to InfinityWard in the first place was to get away from ww2 and maybe do our own thing, perhaps a Sci-Fi game, maybe some fantasy rpg. The world was our oyster as they say. Business is hard, I imagine it was a much easier sell to say &quot;we&#39;ll make something just like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; ( that was doing amazing ), than to pitch some random untried game. Going back to WW2, for me had me kind of thinking that we could never escape the clutches of this success, but it was good for me, because it introduced a new train of thought about those late night crunches and really had me re-evaluating where I was in life as a whole. When I started Clocking out at the end of the day, I was left alone in my thoughts and space. Missing my family back home, plus you know, being a kid not far removed from my fathers suicide, I was still dealing with things. Moving on, thinking of what real-life was like? You know this super fun to make these games but it can&#39;t be healthy. Most people get out of high-school and have to kind of find their way, start a family, work some crappy jobs to make it. My life felt a little bit upside down.</p> <p>I began to walk regularly and ponder a lot in this season of life, you know, what&#39;s next? But I still enjoyed working on that next game, which turned out to be &quot;Call of Duty&quot;..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Front-Independence40"> /u/Front-Independence40 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jueinu/infinitywards_first_game_was_not_call_of_duty/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1jueinu/infinitywards_first_game_was_not_call_of_duty/">[comments]</a></span></div>
